TI  - Blood Cultures are not Useful in the Evaluation of Children with Uncomplicated Superficial Skin and Soft Tissue Infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are commonly performed on children admitted to hospital for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In recent years this practice has been questioned in patients with uncomplicated SSTIs because of its low yield. At the same time, however, an increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections has been described; its influence on rates of bacteremia in patients with SSTIs is unclear. The aims of the study were to describe the performance and the yield of blood culture in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated SSTIs and to determine the prevalence of CA-MRSA as a causative agent in our area. METHODS: Retrospective study. Immunocompetent patients <18 years evaluated in the emergency department and admitted for uncomplicated SSTIs (cellulitis, abscess, impetigo or erysipelas) from July 1, 2010 to June 31, 2014 were included. Patients referred from other hospitals who are receiving parenteral antibiotics and patients with complicated SSTIs (surgical or traumatic wound infection, need for surgical intervention and infected ulcers or burns) were excluded. RESULTS: We included 445 cases: 348 (78.2%) cellulitis, 78 (17.5%) abscess, and 19 (4.3%) impetigo. Blood cultures were performed on 353 (79.3%) patients. Two (0.6%; 95% CI: 0.2-2.0%) were positive and 10 (2.8%; 95% CI: 1.5-5.1%) contaminated. The positive blood cultures grew S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Wound cultures were performed on 148 (33.3%) patients; 98 (66.2%) were positive. In 22 (22.4%) CA-MRSA grew, accounting for 14.9% of overall wound cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Blood cultures are not useful in the management of immunocompetent patients admitted to the hospital with uncomplicated SSTIs. The prevalence of CA-MRSA is low in our area, but continuing careful surveillance is needed.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers against Streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (VicK).
AB  - Two-component systems (TCSs) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. VicK/VicR is one of TCSs in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. We have previously obtained several Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. In this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated based on in vivo and in vitro assays. The results showed that the MICs of 5'-(Methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against S. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/mL, respectively. Time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against S. pneumoniae D39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in CFU after exposure to compounds at four times of the MIC for 24 h. The five compounds inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans or Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on Vero cells. Survival time of the mice infected by S. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. Importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Moreover, even at sub-MIC concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. The five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. Deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. Taken together, our results suggest that these novel VicK inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on bone biopsy yield for children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) is a relatively common reason for hospitalization, but many variables require additional study, including the impact of antibiotic treatment on bone biopsy culture yield. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of children 60 days to 18 years old with AHO seen from 2011 to 2012 in whom bone biopsy cultures were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 67 children had biopsies; median age was 7 years; 40 were pretreated with antibiotics. Microbiologic confirmation was obtained for 72%: in 34%, both blood and bone cultures were positive; in 33%, bone cultures alone were positive; and 4% had only positive blood cultures. There was no difference in bone biopsy cultures for children who did and did not receive antibiotics before biopsy (28/40 [70%] vs 17/27 [63%], odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.49-3.86). For pretreated patients, the mean duration of therapy was longer in children with negative cultures (79 vs 40 hours, P = .04). Bacteremia was seen in 26 (39%), and was more common in antibiotic-pretreated children (55% vs 15%, odds ratio 7, 95% confidence interval 2.1-24.1). Among the 41 nonbacteremic children, bone cultures provided the only microbiologic diagnosis for 22 (54%): 20 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, although bone biopsy results were not affected by previous antibiotic administration, a longer duration of antibiotic therapy before bone biopsy was associated with lower culture yield. In one-third of children, only the bone biopsy resulted in an organism being isolated. As it may take longer to sterilize bone than blood, a bone biopsy/culture should be considered a crucial part of the AHO evaluation to increase diagnostic yield.
TI  - Antimicrobial Efficacy of Ten Commercially Available Herbal Dentifrices against Specific Oral Microflora - In Vitro Study.
AB  - AIM: To determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The standard strains of Streptococcus. mutans (ATCC 21293), Streptococcus sangius (MTCC 442), Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 3268), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2592), Streptococcus pyogenes (MTCC 442) and Candida albicans (ATCC 183) were obtained. Antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. Mean standard deviation and standard error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Danth Kanthi (DK) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (F.S - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). Amar Premium (AP) also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except S. aureus. Of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was observed against S. aureus by Amar Premium (AP) and Dabur Babool (DB) at 24 h. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with DK being the most effective. Hence, it can be inferred that herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.
TI  - Frequency of Spontaneous Resistance to Peptide Deformylase Inhibitor GSK1322322 in Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The continuous emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria is compromising the successful treatment of serious microbial infections. GSK1322322, a novel peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitor, shows good in vitro antibacterial activity and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in human proof-of-concept clinical studies. In vitro studies were performed to determine the frequency of resistance (FoR) to this antimicrobial agent in major pathogens causing respiratory tract and skin infections. Resistance to GSK1322322 occurred at high frequency through loss-of-function mutations in the formyl-methionyl transferase (FMT) protein in Staphylococcus aureus (4/4 strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4/4 strains), and via missense mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae (6/21 strains), but these mutations are associated with a severe in vitro and/or in vivo fitness cost. The overall FoR to GSK1322322 was very low in Haemophilus influenzae with only one PDF mutant identified in one of four strains. No target-based mutants were identified from S. pyogenes, and only one or no PDF mutants were isolated in three of the four S. aureus strains studied. In S. pneumoniae, PDF mutants were only isolated from six of 21 strains tested and an additional 10 strains did not yield colonies on GSK1322322-containing plates. Most of the PDF mutants characterized from these three organisms (35/37), carried mutations in residues at or in close proximity to one of three highly conserved motifs, which are part of the active site of the PDF protein, with 30 of the 35 mutations occurring at position V71 (S. pneumoniae numbering system).
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of native California medicinal plant extracts isolated from Rhamnus californica and Umbellularia californica.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. Medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rhamnus californica (Rhamnaceae) and Umbellularia californica (Lauraceae) are two indigenous California plant species historically used by Native Americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. RESULTS: All extracts inhibited the growth of MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. Gram-negative organisms were unaffected by these extracts. U. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had the lowest MIC values. Chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. Our study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of R. and U. californica and illustrates their promising anti-MRSA potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of California. Further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against MRSA is warranted.
TI  - Discrepancy in MALDI-TOF MS identification of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. The objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with CF. METHODS: A total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with CF representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using MALDI-TOF MS in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. Discrepancies were confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing in five Gram-negative isolates. RESULTS: The MALDI-TOF MS managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as Chryseobacterium gleum and Enterobacter cloacae. The 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all Gram-negative bacteria. The isolation of E. cloacae and Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with CF. CONCLUSION: Although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with CF, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon Gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  - Bacteriology of deep neck infections: analysis of 634 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to review the bacteriology of deep neck infections (DNI) and identify the factors that influence the incidence of causative bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 634 patients with DNI was performed. Statistical analysis was used to compare the incidence of common pathogens in various conditions such as age of the patients, aetiology and associated diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated in 514 cultures (81%). Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 246 cultures (39%) and anaerobic bacteria from 61 cultures (10%). Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 207 cultures (32%). The most common aerobic bacteria were Streptococcus pyogenes (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32%). The most common anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (28%), followed by Prevotela species (8%) and Proprionibacterium species (7%). The incidence of anaerobic bacteria was higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriology of DNI is polymicrobial, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The incidence of anaerobic bacteria is higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients.
TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - Decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and Candida spp.
AB  - Tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by Bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. The polypeptide and its components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. Though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state of resistance are lacking. In the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. Using a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC and MIC90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MSSA (susceptible to methicillin), Staphylococcus aureus of the variety MRSA (methicillin resistant), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spec., Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis was determined. All of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with MICs </= 4mg/l. The tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with MICs of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. No acquired resistance of the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. Thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of Staphylococcus aureus, both with MSSA and MRSA strains. The broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.
TI  - Pathogenic Bacterial Nasopharyngeal Colonization and Its Impact on Respiratory Diseases in the First Year of Life: The PATCH Birth Cohort Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For acute respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, colonization in the respiratory tracts is often the first sign, although nasopharynx is the major source of secretions containing pathogens. To understand the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases, it is important to analyze the establishment of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. METHODS: Infants with nasopharyngeal swabs were examined at the age of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for the detection of pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The methods used for detection were bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From January 2012 to August 2013, a total of 320 neonates were enrolled, and 120 of them completed the first 12-month study. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen at all 5 time points while the rates declined; in contrast, the other 4 increased during the first year of life. Of our series, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection rates were higher than those of bacterial culture. More than 50% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant, and the trend decreased in the same period. In the analysis of factors associated with the development of infant wheeze, infants with maternal atopy [odds ratio (OR): 3.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-8.88; P = 0.02] and pneumococcal colonization (OR: 15.64; 95% CI: 3.25-75.35; P = 0.001) had higher rates of wheeze. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial interactions may result in differing pathogen prevalence in the first year of life. In addition, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may have an effect on the risk of infant wheeze. The result could help clinicians to clarify the relation between bacterial colonization and respiratory illnesses in infancy.
TI  - Green synthesis and structural characterization of selenium nanoparticles and assessment of their antimicrobial property.
AB  - In the present study, selenium nanoparticles were biologically synthesized by non-pathogenic, economic and easy to handle bacterium Ralstonia eutropha. The selenium oxo anion was reduced to selenium nanoparticles in the presence of the bacterium. The bacterium was grown aerobically in the reaction mixture. An extracellular, stable, uniform, spherical selenium nanoparticle was biosynthesized. The TEM analysis revealed that the biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles were spherical in shape with size range of 40-120 nm. XRD and SAED analysis showed that nanocrystalline selenium of pure hexagonal phase was synthesized. The formation of actinomorphic trigonal selenium nanorods was also observed. A mechanism of biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles by R. eutropha was proposed. The biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. Selenium nanoparticles showed excellent antimicrobial activity. The 100, 100, 250 and 100 microg/ml selenium nanoparticles were found to inhibit 99 % growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. Similarly, the 500 microg/ml of selenium nanoparticles was found to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi Aspergillus clavatus. The antimicrobial efficacy of selenium nanoparticle was comparable with commercially available antibiotic drug Ampicillin.
TI  - Bioactivity and chemical characterisation of Lophostemon suaveolens - an endemic  Australian Aboriginal traditional medicinal plant.
AB  - Lophostemon suaveolens is a relatively unexplored endemic medicinal plant of Australia. Extracts of fresh leaves of L. suaveolens obtained from sequential extraction with n-hexane and dichloromethane exhibited antibacterial activity in the disc diffusion and MTT microdilution assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (minimum bactericidal concentration < 63 mug/mL). The dichloromethane extract and chromatographic fractions therein inhibited nitric oxide in RAW264.7 murine macrophages (IC50 3.7-11.6 mug/mL) and also PGE2 in 3T3 murine fibroblasts (IC50 2.8-19.7 mug/mL). The crude n-hexane, dichloromethane and water extracts of the leaves and chromatographic fractions from the dichloromethane extract also showed modest antioxidant activity in the ORAC assay. GC-MS analysis of the n-hexane fraction showed the presence of the antibacterial compounds aromadendrene, spathulenol, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene and alpha-pinene and the anti-inflammatory compounds beta-caryophyllene and spathulenol. Fractionation of the dichloromethane extract led to the isolation of eucalyptin and the known anti-inflammatory compound betulinic acid.
TI  - Development of Gendine Coated Cannula for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion for Extended Use.
AB  - Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. One of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of CSII is CSII set related issues including infection at the infusion site. Current American Diabetic Association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. This adds cost and creates inconvenience. Therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a Teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (Gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. Cannulas were coated with Gendine on exterior surface and dried. Efficacy and durability of Gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. Cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. Gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (P < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. Gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. Our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.
TI  - A retrospective study on clinical findings of 7300 cases (2007-2014) of barren female dromedaries.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical findings in barren female dromedaries examined for different complaints. Female camels were examined for repeat breeding with regular heat interval (RB-R, n = 5444), refused mating (RM, n = 1299), repeat breeding with long heat interval (RB-L, n = 489), difficulties or bleeding during mating (DM, n = 53), and for manifestation of male-like behavior (MB, n = 15). The genital tracts of all females were evaluated using transrectal palpation, ultrasonography, and exploration of the vagina. Cervical swabs were obtained for bacteriologic examination. Clinical endometritis, ovarian hydrobursitis, and vaginal adhesions were the main clinical findings in the female camels examined for RB-R, RM, and RB-L, respectively. Parity affected the frequency of occurrence of these findings. The incidences of clinical endometritis, ovarian hydrobursitis, and vaginal adhesions in nullipara and multipara were 28% versus 32.3% (P = 0.004), 37.1% versus 23.7% (P = 0.001), and 5.7% versus 18.3% (P = 0.001), respectively. Vaginal adhesions, persistent hymen, pelvic abscess, and vulvar atresia were the clinical findings in the female camels presented due to bleeding at mating or with a history of an incomplete intromission of the penis. The male-like behavior was associated with an enlargement of the clitoris and narrowing of the vulva and vagina. Trueperella pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were isolated from females presented for repeat breeding syndrome. In conclusion, clinical endometritis, ovarian hydrobursitis, and vaginal adhesions were the main clinical findings in barren female dromedaries. Parity affected the frequency of the clinical findings.
TI  - Bacterial and Respiratory Viral Interactions in the Etiology of Acute Otitis Media in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected South African Children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM); however, data from low-middle income countries are sparse. We investigated the etiology of AOM in HIV-infected (HIV+), HIV-uninfected (HIV-) and HIV-exposed clinically asymptomatic for HIV-infection (HEU) South African children. METHODS: Children >/=3 months to <5 years of age with AOM were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2010 (NCT01031082). Middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 260 AOM episodes (HIV+:15; HIV-:182; HEU:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including Haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. Respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. Human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of HIV status. Respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (76.9-78.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of AOM in children. A similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of HIV status. Vaccines targeting both nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on AOM in South Africa.
TI  - Biological activities and DNA interactions of Amanita ovoidea.
AB  - CONTEXT: Amanita ovoidea (Bull.) Link (Amanitaceae) is a well-known species due to its pleasant aroma and flavor since ancient times in the worldwide. This species is also known in Turkey and people consume it extensively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medicinal importance of A. ovoidea for human health, to explain the effect of mushroom extracts on bacterial DNA, and to find preventive role on bacterial disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chloroform, acetone, and methanol extracts of A. ovoidea were tested for the antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive bacteria, five Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast using a micro-dilution method. In addition, DNA binding, DNA cleavage activity, and restriction enzyme digestion of the methanol extract of A. ovoidea were examined at different concentrations (40.000-78.125 microg/mL). RESULTS: The highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value observed against the test micro-organisms was with the chloroform extract (MIC 19.5 microg/mL concentration) against Candida albicans. Other highest antimicrobial effects observed against the test micro-organisms were with the methanol extracts against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella enteritidis (MICs, 78 microg/mL concentrations). All concentrations reduced the mobility of plasmid DNA. BamHI and HindIII targeted specially to supercoils and cut them. Amanita ovoidea extract prevented cutting with HindIII by binding especially to the AA region in open circular DNA. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Present results demonstrated that A. ovoidea has excellent antimicrobial and antifungal activities by its DNA interaction activity on pBR322.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - In vivo genome editing using Staphylococcus aureus Cas9.
AB  - The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 has emerged as a versatile genome-editing platform. However, the size of the commonly used Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) limits its utility for basic research and therapeutic applications that use the highly versatile adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vehicle. Here, we characterize six smaller Cas9 orthologues and show that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) can edit the genome with efficiencies similar to those of SpCas9, while being more than 1 kilobase shorter. We packaged SaCas9 and its single guide RNA expression cassette into a single AAV vector and targeted the cholesterol regulatory gene Pcsk9 in the mouse liver. Within one week of injection, we observed >40% gene modification, accompanied by significant reductions in serum Pcsk9 and total cholesterol levels. We further assess the genome-wide targeting specificity of SaCas9 and SpCas9 using BLESS, and demonstrate that SaCas9-mediated in vivo genome editing has the potential to be efficient and specific.
TI  - Colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in New Zealand preschool children.
AB  - AIM: To describe colonisation patterns of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) among pre-school children in New Zealand. METHOD: Anterior nasal, oropharyngeal, and antecubital fossa swabs were collected from a diverse sample of 139 New Zealand children aged 4 years. Swabs were cultured for S. aureus and S. pyogenes. S. aureus isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: S. aureus colonisation was more prevalent than S. pyogenes colonisation; 54% of the children were colonised with S. aureus whereas only 16% were colonised with S. pyogenes, at one or more sampling sites (P<0.0001). S. aureus was present in a larger proportion of swabs obtained from the anterior nasal (39%, P<0.0001) or oropharynx (32%, P=0.0002) than from the antecubital fossa (14%). S. pyogenes was present in a larger proportion of swabs obtained from the oropharynx (16%) than either the anterior nasal (4%, P=0.001) or the antecubital fossa (2%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: S. aureus and S. pyogenes are prevalent at superficial sites in preschool children in NZ, with S. aureus colonisation more prevalent than S. pyogenes colonisation. Colonisation frequency varies by site for both pathogens; S. aureus is more prevalent in the anterior nares and oropharynx while S. pyogenes is more prevalent in the oropharynx.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010: General view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, was conducted by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010. The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from January and April 2010 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 Staphylococcus aureus, 189 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 182 Haemophilus influenzae, 74 Moraxella catarrhalis, 139 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was as high as 50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - [Apoptogenic activity of microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus infection].
AB  - AIM: Study apoptogenic activity of-microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus  infection (EBVI) on the model of mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of apoptosis induced by bacteria isolated from EBVI patients was carried out by characteristic morphological changes of macrophages in smears stained by May-Grunwald with additional staining by Romanowsky-Giemsa. RESULTS: All the EBVI microbes-associants were established to have apoptogenic activity, however, the highest pathogenic potential was noted in Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSION: The presence of apoptogenic activity in bacterial microflora accompanying EBVI against immune system cells could serve as means of their survival and be the pathogenetic basis for prolonged persistence in the organism.
TI  - [Selected bacterial infections of the skin in childhood].
AB  - Bacterial infections of the skin are often seen by dermatologists. The majority of infections are caused by the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These induce blistering/erosive (impetigo, ecthymata) and abceeding (folliculitis) infections of the skin, respectively. Owing to their differences in virulence factors and host immunity, these strains can lead to varying presentations and courses of the infections. This review focuses on impetigo, folliculitis, perianal streptococcal dermatitis, and ecthymata.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as  FtsZ inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. The results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. Among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-MBA) against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-MBA but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of S. aureus ATCC29213. Particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/mL) against S. pyogenes PS, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-MBA, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. In addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of cell division against S. aureus ATCC25923, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/mL.
TI  - Site-specific immobilization of protein layers on gold surfaces via orthogonal sortases.
AB  - We report a site-specific, sortase-mediated ligation to immobilize proteins layer-by-layer on a gold surface. Recombinant fluorescent proteins with a Sortase A recognition tag at the C-terminus were immobilized on peptide-modified gold surfaces. We used two sortases with different substrate specificities (Streptococcus pyogenes Sortase A and Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A) to immobilize layers of GFP and mCherry site-specifically on the gold surface. Surfaces were characterized using fluorescence and atomic force microscopy after immobilizing each layer of protein. Fluorescent micrographs showed that both protein immobilization on the modified gold surface and protein oligomerization are sortase-dependent. AFM images showed that either homogenous protein monolayers or layers of protein oligomers can be generated using appropriately tagged substrate proteins. Using Sortase A variants with orthogonal peptide substrate specificities, site-specific immobilization of appropriately tagged GFP onto a layer of immobilized mCherry was achieved without disruption of the underlying protein layer.
TI  - Development and laboratory evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for detecting viruses and bacteria of relevance for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia may present with similar clinical symptoms, regardless of viral or bacterial cause. Diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. Technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. Upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were used to compare the qPCR assay with standard microbiological methods. The limit of detection was 5 to 20 DNA template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. SDs for positive controls were <5%. The use of the qPCR assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. Diagnostic accuracy of the qPCR assay varied between 60% positive agreement with standard tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and 100% for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Negative percentage of agreement was >95% for M. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus; whereas it was only 56% for Haemophilus influenzae. Multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. We conclude that in parallel qPCR detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. The results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens.
TI  - [SEIP-AEPAP-SEPEAP consensus document on the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial skin infections in out-patients].
AB  - Skin infections are a common cause for dermatological consultations in the paediatric setting. A review is presented of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of the main bacterial skin infections, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of super-infected puncture and bite wounds. The most prevalent bacteria in skin infections are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Treatment is usually empirical, since microbiological studies are only recommended under certain circumstances or lack of improvement with common therapies. Superficial skin infections can be treated with local antiseptics or antibiotics (mupirocin or fusidic acid). Systemic treatment is usually reserved for patients with extensive or severe disease or with other risk factors. Systemic treatment depends on the suspected infecting bacteria, with penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and first or second generation cephalosporin being the most frequently used drugs. Due to the low incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant infection by S. aureus in Spain, the use of clindamycin or co-trimoxazole is only recommended after severe disease, relapses or a clear epidemiological background.
TI  - Surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 33,688 Staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (VGS), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) were included in this cross-susceptibility (DAL versus vancomycin [VAN]) analysis as well as 4576 coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). Isolates were collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program for the United States (USA) and Europe (2011-2013). Susceptibility testing followed CLSI (M07-A9 and M100-S24) methods. USA Food and Drug Administration (DAL) and CLSI (VAN) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between DAL and VAN susceptibility results. A categorical agreement (CA; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between DAL and VAN when testing S. aureus. Only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against VAN-susceptible isolates that displayed a DAL-nonsusceptible (MIC, 0.25 or 0.5mug/mL) phenotype. When susceptible MIC correlations were analyzed against indicated BHS species (Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes), an overall CA rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. Complete (100.0%) CA was documented for S. pyogenes, as well as against all VGS isolates, including the indicated Streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). In conclusion, high susceptible CA rates between DAL and VAN were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in ABSSSI. VAN-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by DAL (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/mL.
TI  - Detection of Chlamydophila Pneumoniae and Typical Bacteria in Patients with Chronic Cough.
AB  - The aim of research was to analyze the results of microbiological tests for typical and atypical bacteria in patients with symptoms of chronic cough. A total of 214 outpatients aged from 2 to 94 years (110 women, 64 men, and 40 children) with chronic cough were studied. Four hundred twenty eight throat swabs were examined for atypical bacteria antigen (Chlamydophila pneumoniae) (n = 214) and typical pathogens (n = 214). Chl. pneumoniae detection was performed using indirect immunofluorescence test. Classical microbiological culture was used for typical bacteria detection. Chl. pneumoniae antigen was detected in 55/214 (26.0 %) patients with chronic cough (in 31 (28.2 %) women, 14 (21.9 %) men, and 10 (25.0 %) children). Positive culture for typical pathogens was observed in 30 (27.3 %) women, 22 (34.4 %) men, and 21 (52.5 %) children. Simultaneous occurrence of Chl. pneumoniae and typical pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus strain MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Moraxella catarrhalis) was found in 16 (7.5 %) patients. The findings show that in patients with chronic cough Chl. pneumoniae infection, although less than that with typical pathogens, is rather frequent. Further, the performance of test for Chl. pneumoniae in throat swabs from patients with chronic cough is good and provides an efficient way to diagnose the infection and implement appropriate therapy.
TI  - Reduction of Lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. The mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (SCC). Although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk SCC, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, Lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and SCC have not been determined previously. Thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. The overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. The Lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative PCR. Mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. Based on comparison with the pairwise Mann-Whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (P=0.0175), but lower E. coli (P=0.0002), S. aureus (P<0.0001), S. agalactiae (P=0.0001) and T. pyogenes (P=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. The negative correlation between Lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the SCC, was confirmed with Spearman correlation analysis. Data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between Lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.
TI  - Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation.
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and their  associated (Cas) proteins provide adaptive immunity against viral infection in prokaryotes. Upon infection, short phage sequences known as spacers integrate between CRISPR repeats and are transcribed into small RNA molecules that guide the Cas9 nuclease to the viral targets (protospacers). Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 cleavage of the viral genome requires the presence of a 5'-NGG-3' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence immediately downstream of the viral target. It is not known whether and how viral sequences flanked by the correct PAM are chosen as new spacers. Here we show that Cas9 selects functional spacers by recognizing their PAM during spacer acquisition. The replacement of cas9 with alleles that lack the PAM recognition motif or recognize an NGGNG PAM eliminated or changed PAM specificity during spacer acquisition, respectively. Cas9 associates with other proteins of the acquisition machinery (Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2), presumably to provide PAM-specificity to this process. These results establish a new function for Cas9 in the genesis of prokaryotic immunological memory.
TI  - Eravacycline (TP-434) is efficacious in animal models of infection.
AB  - Eravacycline is a novel broad-spectrum fluorocycline antibiotic being developed for a wide range of serious infections. Eravacycline was efficacious in mouse septicemia models, demonstrating 50% protective dose (PD50) values of </= 1 mg/kg of body weight once a day (q.d.) against Staphylococcus aureus, including tetracycline-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus pyogenes. The PD50 values against Escherichia coli isolates were 1.2 to 4.4 mg/kg q.d. In neutropenic mouse thigh infection models with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and S. pyogenes, eravacycline produced 2 log10 reductions in CFU at single intravenous (i.v.) doses ranging from 0.2 to 9.5 mg/kg. In a neutropenic mouse lung infection model, eravacycline administered i.v. at 10 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.) reduced the level of tetracycline-resistant MRSA in the lung equivalent to that of linezolid given orally (p.o.) at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. At i.v. doses of 3 to 12 mg/kg b.i.d., eravacycline was more efficacious against tetracycline-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in a neutropenic lung infection model than linezolid p.o. at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. Eravacycline showed good efficacy at 2 to 10 mg/kg i.v. b.i.d., producing up to a 4.6 log10 CFU reduction in kidney bacterial burden in a model challenged with a uropathogenic E. coli isolate. Eravacycline was active in multiple murine models of infection against clinically important Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Fabric-skin models to assess infection transfer for impetigo contagiosa in a kindergarten scenario.
AB  - Children in community bodies like kindergartens are predisposed to suffer from impetigo. To consider important measures for infection prevention, direct and indirect transmission routes of pathogens must be revealed. Therefore, we studied the role of skin and fabrics in the spread of the impetigo pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and the strain Streptococcus equi (surrogate to Streptococcus pyogenes) in order to assess infection transfer in realistic scenarios. The transmission of test strains was studied with standardized fabric-skin models using a technical artificial skin and fabrics of different fiber types commonly occurring in German kindergartens. In synthetic pus, both test strains persisted on artificial skin and fabrics for at least 4 h. Friction enhanced transfer, depending on the fiber type or fabric construction. In a skin-to-skin setup, the total transfer was higher than via fabrics and no decrease in the transmission rates from donor to recipients could be observed after successive direct skin contacts. Children in kindergartens may be at risk of transmission for impetigo pathogens, especially via direct skin contact, but also by the joint use of fabrics, like towels or handicraft materials. Fabric-skin models used in this study enable further insight into the transmission factors for skin infections on the basis of a practical approach.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and chemical characterization of essential oils of Thymusvulgaris, Rosmarinus officinalis, and Origanum majorana from northeastern Mexico.
AB  - There have been no reports of antifungal activity and composition of extracts from Thymus vulgaris, Rosmarinus officinalis or Origanum majorana from northeastern Mexico. Antifungal activity of these oils against Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis and Epidermophyton floccosum was measured by diffusion assay. Additionally, antibacterial and antioxidant activities were evaluated. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes was examined by microdilution. Antioxidant activity was assessed by 2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidracil reduction test. The plant oils were characterized by both GC/MS and GC/FID. Oils of T. vulgaris and O. majorana showed growth inhibition activity against dermatophytes, especially T. vulgaris oil, which completely inhibited growth of all tested dermatophytes. The oils also showed bioactivity against bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between 62.5 and 500 mug/mL. The antioxidant activity of the oils was low, with effective concentration (EC50) values <250mug/mL. The major components in the oils were as follows: T. vulgaris, o-cymene, mu-terpinene, thymol and carvacrol; R. officinalis, terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole; O. majorana, terpinen-4-ol and thymol.
TI  - Anticariogenic and Hemolytic Activity of Selected Seed Protein Extracts In vitro  conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the anticariogenic and hemolytic activity of crude plant seed protein extracts against tooth decaying bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proteins from seeds of 12 different plants were extracted and used for antimicrobial assay against six different organisms. The extraction was carried out in 10mM of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford method. Anticariogenic activity was studied by agar well diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was evaluated by the two-fold serial broth dilution method. Hemolytic activity, treatment of proteinase K and Kinetic study in Mimusops elengi crude seed protein extract. RESULTS: The anticariogenic assay demonstrated the activity of Mimusops elengi against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A minor activity of Glycine wightii against Streptococcus mutans was also found. The protein content of Mimusops elengi seed protein extract was 5.84mg/ml. The MIC values for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes against Mimusops elengi seed protein extract were 364.36mug/ml and 182.19mug/ml, respectively. Kinetic study further elucidated the mode of inhibition in the presence of the Mimusops elengi plant seed protein with respect to time. The concentration of crude extract which gave 50% hemolysis compared to Triton X-100 treatment (HC50) value was 1.58 mg/ml; which is more than five times larger than that of the MIC. Treatment with proteinase K of the Mimusops elengi seed protein resulted in absence of the inhibition zone; which clearly indicates that the activity was only due to protein. CONCLUSION: Our results showed the prominence of Mimusops elengi plant seed protein extract as an effective herbal medication against tooth decaying bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of conformational, spectral, antimicrobial activity, chemical reactivity and NLO application of Pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde bis(oxaloyldihydrazone).
AB  - An orange colored pyrrole dihydrazone: Pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde bis(oxaloyldihydrazone) (PDBO) has been synthesized by reaction of oxalic acid dihydrazide with 2,5 diformyl-1H-pyrrole and has been characterized by spectroscopic analysis (1H, 13C NMR, UV-visible, FT-IR and DART Mass). The properties of the compound has been evaluated using B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p)/6-311+G(d,p) basis set. The symmetric (3319, 3320 cm(-1)) and asymmetric (3389, 3382 cm(-1)) stretching wave number confirm free NH2 groups in PDBO. NBO analysis shows, inter/intra molecular interactions within the molecule. Topological parameters have been analyzed by QTAIM theory and provide the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding (N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO). The local reactivity descriptors analyses determine the reactive sites within molecule. The calculated first hyperpolarizability value (beta0=23.83x10(-30) esu) of pyrrole dihydrazone shows its suitability for non-linear optical (NLO) response. The preliminary bioassay suggested that the PDBO exhibits relatively good antibacterial and fungicidal activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. The local reactivity descriptors--Fukui functions (fk+, fk-), local softnesses (sk+, sk-) and electrophilicity indices (omegak+, omegak-) analyses have been used to determine the reactive sites within molecule.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of Limnophila rugosa Roth. (Merr) leaf.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limphonia rugosa Roth. (Merr.), family-Scrophulariaceae is considered as a botanical source of classical Ayurvedic drug Bhringaraja by the traditional practitioners of Odisha and is being used for the management of various disorders. AIM: To study the antimicrobial activity of leaf of L. rugosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extract of L. rugosa leaf (LRLM) has been studied, at various (5, 25, 50, 100, 250 mug/ml) dilutions, against medically important human pathogenic bacteria (two Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and two Gram-negative-Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, A. clavatus, Candida albicans) by using the agar disc diffusion method. A zone of inhibition of extract was compared with that of different standards such as ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial activity and nystatin and griseofulvin for antifungal activity. RESULTS: The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the LRLM increased linear with the increase in concentration of extracts. When compared with standard drugs, the results revealed that, for bacterial activity S. pyogenes and S. aureus were more sensitive and in fungal activity C. albicans was more inhibited. The range of growth inhibition zone for all the sensitive bacteria was 11-20 mm and 13-19 mm for fungal strains. CONCLUSION: Methanolic extract of L. rugosa leaf is having antibacterial and antifungal activities.
TI  - Short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of Citrus sinensis.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of Citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcesnces, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter amnigenus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia odorifera. Methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. In vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. It was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of C. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of S. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). The potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. The order of antioxidant activity through ABTS.+ and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. Phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. It was also found that Chloroform/Methanol (5:5) and Butanol/Ethanol/Water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. These findings reveal the potential use of C. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
TI  - The microbiology of impetigo in Indigenous children: associations between Streptococcus pyogenes , Staphylococcus aureus, scabies, and nasal carriage.
AB  - BackgroundImpetigo is caused by both Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; the relative contributions of each have been reported to fluctuate with time and region. While S. aureus is reportedly on the increase in most industrialised settings, S. pyogenes is still thought to drive impetigo in endemic, tropical regions. However, few studies have utilised high quality microbiological culture methods to confirm this assumption. We report the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of impetigo pathogens recovered in a randomised, controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote Indigenous communities of northern Australia.ResultsFrom 508 children, we collected 872 swabs of sores and 504 swabs from the anterior nares prior to commencement of antibiotic therapy. S. pyogenes and S. aureus were identified together in 503/872 (58%) of sores; with an additional 207/872 (24%) sores having S. pyogenes and 81/872 (9%) S. aureus, in isolation. Skin sore swabs taken during episodes with a concurrent diagnosis of scabies were more likely to culture S. pyogenes (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 inverted question mark 4.4, p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.03). Eighteen percent of children had nasal carriage of skin pathogens. There was no association between the presence of S. aureus in the nose and skin. Methicillin-resistance was detected in 15% of children who cultured S. aureus from either a sore or their nose. There was no association found between the severity of impetigo and the detection of a skin pathogen.Conclusions S. pyogenes remains the principal pathogen in tropical impetigo; the relatively high contribution of S. aureus as a co-pathogen has also been confirmed. Children with scabies were more likely to have S. pyogenes detected. While clearance of S. pyogenes is the key determinant of treatment efficacy, co-infection with S. aureus warrants consideration of treatment options that are effective against both pathogens where impetigo is severe and prevalent.Trial registrationThis trial is registered; ACTRN12609000858291.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of Monarda punctata essential oil  and its main components against common bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract.
AB  - The aim of the current research work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oil of Monarda punctata along with evaluating the essential oil and its major components for their antibacterial effects against some frequently encountered respiratory infection causing pathogens. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. The oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. Antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The study revealed that the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest MIC and MBC values. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher MIC and MBC values. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in S. pyogenes and MRSA bacterial strains. The reactive oxygen species generated by the Monarda punctata essential oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA).This study indicated that the Monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ROS levels in S. pyogenes bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by SEM results.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mode of action of the Artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  - Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. Gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. The antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MRSA (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MGRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. The essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. The essential oil was most active against S. pyogenes, MRSA (clinical strain), S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. Piperitone and capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. Furthermore, the essential oil of A. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the S. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the S. aureus bacterial cultures. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of A. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. In conclusion, A. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in S. aureus bacterial cultures.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of Pleurostylia capensis Turcz (Loes) (celastraceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleurostylia capensis is a large tree that can reach the maximum height of 20 m long, and it have been traditionally used as cosmetic, for steam bath, ritual body wash, and as a purgative to treat symptoms of witchcraft. Using ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and water extracts, leaves, bark and roots of Pleurostylia capensis were investigated scientifically for their effectiveness in antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities using standard methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis), Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium), and Candida albicans. The antioxidant activity was investigated using 2, 2-diphenlyl-1-picrylhadrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. capensis extracts was evaluated against both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX 1 and 2). RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extracts of P. capensis showed a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, K. pneumonia, S. pyogenes, and M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/ml. While the ethanol bark extract was most active against M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.78 mg/ml; the least potent activity was observed with dichloromethane, chloroform and water extracts, with an MIC value ranging from 1.56 mg/ml to 50.0 mg/ml. The plant extracts proved to be good antioxidant agent, whereas extracts of ethanol were the most active, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 1.74 microg/ml, which is lower, and in close range to Vitamin C (1.40 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Its moderation to potent inhibitory activity was observed in all extracts. Ethanol and dichloromethane extracts were among the most potent when compared to water and petroleum ether extracts. The water extracts showed to be nontoxic on the Hek cell line with an IC50 value of 204.0, and 207.3 microg/ml (roots and bark) respectively. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and ethanol extracts showed to be toxic on the Hek cell, with IC50 range from 5.94 to 42.91microg/ml. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of these plants.
TI  - The crimson conundrum: heme toxicity and tolerance in GAS.
AB  - The massive erythrocyte lysis caused by the Group A Streptococcus (GAS) suggests  that the beta-hemolytic pathogen is likely to encounter free heme during the course of infection. In this study, we investigated GAS mechanisms for heme sensing and tolerance. We compared the minimal inhibitory concentration of heme among several isolates and established that excess heme is bacteriostatic and exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of heme resulted in noticeable damage to membrane lipids and proteins. Pre-exposure of the bacteria to 0.1 muM heme shortened the extended lag period that is otherwise observed when naive cells are inoculated into heme-containing medium, implying that GAS is able to adapt. The global response to heme exposure was determined using microarray analysis revealing a significant transcriptome shift that included 79 up regulated and 84 down regulated genes. Among other changes, the induction of stress-related chaperones and proteases, including groEL/ES (8x), the stress regulators spxA2 (5x) and ctsR (3x), as well as redox active enzymes were prominent. The heme stimulon also encompassed a number of regulatory proteins and two-component systems that are important for virulence. A three-gene cluster that is homologous to the pefRCD system of the Group B Streptococcus was also induced by heme. PefR, a MarR-like regulator, specifically binds heme with stoichiometry of 1:2 and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) with stoichiometry of 1:1, implicating it is one of the GAS mediators to heme response. In summary, here we provide evidence that heme induces a broad stress response in GAS, and that its success as a pathogen relies on mechanisms for heme sensing, detoxification, and repair.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potential of Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser - A less explored  Indian mistletoe Growing on Mango Trees.
AB  - Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser (Loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in India. It is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. There are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. Based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. For the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. The antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio fischeri, and a fungus Candida albicans. Of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of H. elastica was found to be active against K. pneumoniae, A. hydrophila, E. coli, and V. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. C. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Ozenoxacin 1% cream in the treatment of impetigo: a multicenter, randomized, placebo- and retapamulin-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: We compared the efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin (a new nonfluorinated quinolone) 1% cream with placebo in the treatment of impetigo. PATIENTS & METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, patients received ozenoxacin cream or placebo cream twice daily for 5 days (a third group received retapamulin 1% ointment as a control). Clinical, microbiological and laboratory evaluations were performed during follow-up (over 2 weeks). RESULTS: Ozenoxacin was superior to placebo (success rate 34.8 vs 19.2%; p = 0.003). Microbiological success was 70.8% for ozenoxacin and 38.2% for placebo after 3-4 days and 79.2% versus 56.6% after 6-7 days. Ozenoxacin produced more rapid microbiological clearance than retapamulin. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Ozenoxacin 1% cream was effective and safe in the treatment of impetigo.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive pathogens isolated in Canadian hospital laboratories from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens isolated in 15 Canadian hospital laboratories between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility to oritavancin and comparative antimicrobial agents using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Oritavancin demonstrated in vitro activity equivalent to, or more potent than, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against the isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=1460; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.7% oritavancin-susceptible), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n=427; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.5% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=132; oritavancin MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL; 99.2% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=156; oritavancin MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL; 100% oritavancin-susceptible), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=304; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 98.7% oritavancin-susceptible) tested.
TI  - Managing cervical lymphadenitis--a total pain in the neck!
AB  - Patients presenting with cervical lymphadenitis are a complex and common occurrence in a general pediatric practice. Although Staphylococcus aureus (often methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes predominate as causative pathogens, the next most common pathogens, Bartonella, atypical mycobacterium, and mononucleosis, also must be considered early on. The best way to diagnose and manage these cases initially is to proceed methodically, with detailed history and physical examination, initial streptococcal mono rapid tests, serial office visits, and complete blood counts. In nonviral cases, an empiric oral antibiotic trial is usually prescribed as early as possible to cover for MRSA or Bartonella. Very tender or reddened lymph nodes larger than 5 cm that are unresponsive and worsening may likely require inpatient parenteral antibiotics and sometimes surgical removal. The practitioner must also realize that submandibular and supraclavicular node locations are highly suggestive of atypical mycombacterium and cancer, respectively.
TI  - A VLU complicated by severe group a streptococcal infection resulting in necrotising fasciitis and septic shock: a case report.
AB  - This case study outlines the management of a patient with a venous leg ulcer whose swabs cultured Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group A while in hospital with cellulitis, which was treated with antibiotics as per sensitivities. However, the patient presented at the emergency department five weeks later with a diagnosis of invasive group A streptococcal disease resulting in necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. This paper describes the holistic care and wound management that the patient received.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients in Nigeria: a 5-year multicentre retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A clear knowledge of the pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a given region and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is necessary for optimal treatment. We determined the common bacterial pathogens causing CAP in Nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of CAP. METHODS: Case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in South East Nigeria with a diagnosis of CAP between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. To be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. Socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. RESULTS: Of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of CAP, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 18.8 years. Aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 12.7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%). The susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. CONCLUSION: Strep. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae were the most common causes of CAP. The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. We suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of CAP in Nigeria.
TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction for microbiological diagnosis of parapneumonic effusions in Canadian children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema is an infectious syndrome commonly encountered by physicians caring for children in Canada. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incremental benefit of novel molecular testing for the microbiological diagnosis of pediatric CAP complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema in Canada. METHODS: A convenience sample of pleural fluid from 56 children who had been admitted to hospital in Ontario with CAP complicated by parapneumonic effusion between 2009 and 2011 was examined. Multiple uniplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed on these pleural fluids and compared with traditional culture-based testing of blood and pleural fluid samples. RESULTS: Molecular methods detected a pathogen in 82% of cases, whereas traditional cultures of blood and pleural fluids detected a pathogen in only 25%. The majority of parapneumonic effusions were associated with pneumococcal infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 62% of the samples using molecular methods but in only 14% of samples using culture-based methods. Streptococcus pyogenes, detected in 16% of samples using PCR, was the second most common pathogen found. No patients were found to have empyema caused by Staphylococcus aureus. DISCUSSION: The results showed that multiple uniplex real-time PCR performed substantially better than traditional culture methods for microbiological diagnosis of CAP complicated by effusion/ empyema. S pneumoniae and S pyogenes were found to be responsible for the majority of infections. The approach detected pathogens in a similar proportion of pleural fluid samples as previously reported nested PCR assays; furthermore, the real-time closed-well approach also minimized the risk of nonspecificity due to cross-contamination relative to nested PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR for the detection of bacterial DNA in pleural fluids has the potential to better define the microbiological cause of pediatric CAP. This approach could help clinicians provide targeted antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Impetigo: diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. There are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). Nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. Impetigo primarily affects the skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. Bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by S. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. Both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. Natural therapies such as tea tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. Treatments under development include minocycline foam and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. Topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. Empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and streptococcal infections. Clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole covers methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, but is inadequate for streptococcal infection.
TI  - Systemic bioavailability and safety of twice-daily topical ozenoxacin 1% cream in adults and children with impetigo.
AB  - In this Phase I open-label study, the systemic absorption, clinical response, safety and tolerability of multiple-dose ozenoxacin 1% cream were evaluated in children (>/= 2 months of age) and adults with impetigo. A single (evening) dose of ozenoxacin 1% cream on day 1 was followed by twice-daily application for 4 days (every 12 h), and then a final single (morning) dose on day 6. A total of 46 patients were enrolled in the study. The majority of ozenoxacin plasma samples were below the limit of quantification (no systemic absorption). Approximately half (22/45) of the evaluable patients achieved clinical success (skin lesions were cured). No patients were withdrawn from the study because of a lack of healing or worsening of a lesion. Ozenoxacin was well tolerated in all patients.
TI  - Acute cervical lymphadenitis and infections of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute cervical adenitis can evolve into suppurative cervical lymphadenitis and may sometimes be associated with infection of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces (i.e., retropharyngeal and poststyloid parapharyngeal abscesses). This study aimed to describe the clinical presentation of acute cervical lymphadenitis and infections of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces in children and examine the management of these conditions. METHODS: This was a retrospective study including children from 3 months to 18 years old who were hospitalized in the Pediatric Department of the Centre-Intercommunal-de-Creteil between January 2003 and May 2010. Selected cases were based on the diagnosis of acute cervical lymphadenitis, suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, or infections of the retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal spaces. Case history, clinical signs, laboratory tests, imaging, treatment and clinical course were collected from patient charts. RESULTS: We included 75 children (54 males [72%]); 62 (83%) were < 6 years old. Diagnoses were acute cervical lymphadenitis in 43 patients (57%), suppurative cervical lymphadenitis in 13 (17%), retropharyngeal or poststyloid parapharyngeal abscess in 18 (24%) and cervical necrotizing fasciitis in 1 (1%). In total, 72 patients (96%) presented fever and 34 (45%) had torticollis. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis or abscesses of the retropharyngeal or poststyloid parapharyngeal spaces was significantly higher for children with than without torticollis (52.9% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001). In all, 21 patients among the 44 > 3 years old (48%) underwent a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes; results for 10 were positive (48%). Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck in children with torticollis (n = 31) demonstrated an abscess in 21 (68%). Fine-needle aspiration was performed in 8 patients (11%) and 8 (11%) required surgical drainage. Bacteriology was positive in 8 patients (11%), with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus and S. pyogenes. All patients received intravenous antibiotics and the outcome was favorable regardless of surgery. Recurrence was observed in only 1 case among the 34 patients with a follow-up visit after discharge. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that presentation with cervical lymphadenitis associated with fever and torticollis requires evaluation by contrast-enhanced CT scan. Furthermore, abscess drainage should be restricted to the most severely affected patients who do not respond to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Molecular identification of pathogenic bacteria in eschars from acute febrile patients, Senegal.
AB  - Fever caused by Rickettsia felis was recently shown to play an important role in  infectious diseases morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. We collected 68 cotton swabs from fever-associated eschars in four different regions of Senegal. In 5 of 68 eschar samples (7.4%), we have identified DNA from R. felis. In 49 of 68 eschar samples (72.1%), we have identified DNA from Staphylococcus aureus. In 35 of 68 eschar samples (51.5%), we have identified DNA from Streptococcus pyogenes, and in 4 of 68 eschar samples (5.9%), we have identified DNA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 34 cases, S. aureus was found together with S. pyogenes. DNA from R. felis was also found in swabs from the skin of the healthy Senegalese villagers (3 of 60; 5%) but not French urbanites. The presence of S. aureus and S. pyogenes was significantly associated with the presence of eschars in febrile patients compared with the healthy skin from the control group. Finally, we confirmed that Senegal is an endemic region for R. felis, which is found in both eschars and healthy skin swabs.
TI  - Antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus sortase.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most frequent cause of  hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. Due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of MRSA infection with antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as Clostridium difficile infection. Sortase A is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of S. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to cause bacteremia or sepsis in mice. Here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor structure to identify 3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazo le and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. Sortase inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice against lethal S. aureus bacteremia. Thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective therapy to prevent hospital-acquired S. aureus infection in high-risk patients without the side effects of antibiotics.
TI  - Filtration of crushed tablet suspensions has potential to reduce infection incidence in people who inject drugs.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: The medical complications of injecting preparations from crushed tablets can be severe, and most can be attributed to the injection of insoluble particles and micro-organisms. Previously we have shown that most of the particles can be removed by filtration, but it was not known whether bacteria could also be filtered in the presence of a high particle load. This study aims to determine the feasibility of filtration to remove bacteria from injections prepared from tablets. DESIGN AND METHODS: Injections were prepared from crushed slow-release morphine tablets, in mixed bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The injection suspensions were passed through syringe filters of porosity 0.45 or 0.20 mum, or combined 0.8 then 0.2 mum, and the bacterial load was counted. RESULTS: Bacterial concentrations in unfiltered injections were 2.5-4.3 x 10(6) colony forming units mL(-1) . Both the 0.20 and 0.45 mum filters blocked unless a prefilter (cigarette filter) was used first. The 0.2 mum filter and the combined 0.8/0.2 mum filter reduced the bacteria to the limit of detection (10 colony forming units mL(-1) ) or below. Filtration through a 0.45 mum filter was slightly less effective. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Use of a 0.2 mum filter, together with other injection hygiene measures, offers the prospect of greatly reducing the medical complications of injecting crushed tablets and should be considered as a highly effective harm reduction method. It is very likely that these benefits would also apply to other illicit drug injections, although validation studies are needed.
TI  - Microbiological quality of indoor air in university libraries.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the concentration of bacteria and fungi in the indoor environment of Jimma University libraries, so as to estimate the health hazard and to create standards for indoor air quality control. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of eight libraries of Jimma University was determined. The settle plate method using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed to collect sample twice daily. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: The concentrations of bacteria and fungi aerosols in the indoor environment of the university libraries ranged between 367-2595 CFU/m(3). According to the sanitary standards classification of European Commission, almost all the libraries indoor air of Jimma University was heavily contaminated with bacteria and fungi. In spite of their major source difference, the average fungi density found in the indoor air of libraries did appear to follow the same trend with bacterial density (P=0.001). The bacteria isolates included Micrococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Neisseria sp. while Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp., Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. were the most isolated fungi. CONCLUSIONS: The indoor air of all libraries were in the range above highly contaminated according to European Commission classification and the most isolates are considered as potential candidates involved in the establishment of sick building syndromes and often associated with clinical manifestations like allergy, rhinitis, asthma and conjunctivitis. Thus, attention must be given to control those environmental factors which favor the growth and multiplication of microbes in indoor environment of libraries to safeguard the health of users and workers.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (AI), on the probability of conception in Holstein cows. Clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after AI was modeled. The first 4 AI in a cow's lactation were included. The following categories of pathogens were studied: Streptococcus spp. (comprising Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and other Streptococcus spp.); Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including Citrobacter, yeasts, Trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter, and Citrobacter), Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium spp., Pasteurella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, and others]. Other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of AI (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first AI, farm, and other non-CM diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Data from 90,271 AI in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004 to 2011 from 5 New York State dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a Poisson distribution. The largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with CM occurring in the week before AI or in the 2 wk following AI. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. The probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter estimates. These findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in their dairy cows for more effective cow management.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum of spontaneously ruptured otitis media in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Germany.
AB  - Otitis media is a common pediatric disease and the main reason for antibiotic prescription in children. Before implementation of routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination in Germany, serotypes contained in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) were among the most frequent pneumococcal serotypes responsible for acute otitis media (AOM). This report describes the first 3 years of a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological cross-sectional study examining the bacteriology of middle ear fluids (MEF) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) of children 2 months to 5 years of age with spontaneously perforated AOM in the era of routine pneumococcal vaccination. MEF was obtained from 963 subjects; NPS from 877. Reported case numbers steeply decreased over the three study years even though the recruiting base remained the same. Among subjects with relevant bacterial growth in their MEF swabs, 113 (11.7%) had Streptococcus pyogenes, 97 (10.1%) Staphylococcus aureus, 88 (9.1%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, 63 (6.5%) Haemophilus influenzae, and 8 (0.8%) Moraxella catarrhalis. S. pneumoniae isolates decreased from 41 (9.3%) in year 1 to 12 (5.7%) in year 3 (p = 0.128). PCV7 serotypes accounted for only 7.9% (n = 7) of isolated pneumococci. Of the 877 subjects with NPS cultures, 465 (53.0%) carried S. pneumoniae, 314 (35.8%) H. influenzae, 292 (33.3%) M. catarrhalis, and 110 (12.5%) S. pyogenes; 79.4% (n = 765) of the children were vaccinated with at least one dose of PCV. Carriage of pneumococci was slightly lower in vaccinated (47.8%) than in unvaccinated (52.7%) children (p = 0.254). PCV7 serotypes were carried by 9.6% of unvaccinated children but by only 4.2% of vaccinated children, resulting in a 56.3% vaccine effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Following universal PCV7 immunization, a clear epidemiological impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was observed as PCV7 serotypes have almost disappeared among AOM.
TI  - Chromosomal islands of Streptococcus pyogenes and related streptococci: molecular switches for survival and virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is a significant pathogen of humans, annually causing over 700,000,000 infections and 500,000 deaths. Virulence in S. pyogenes is closely linked to mobile genetic elements like phages and chromosomal islands (CI). S. pyogenes phage-like chromosomal islands (SpyCI) confer a complex mutator phenotype on their host. SpyCI integrate into the 5' end of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutL, which also disrupts downstream operon genes lmrP, ruvA, and tag. During early logarithmic growth, SpyCI excise from the bacterial chromosome and replicate as episomes, relieving the mutator phenotype. As growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase, SpyCI reintegrate into the chromosome, again silencing the MMR operon. This system creates a unique growth-dependent and reversible mutator phenotype. Additional CI using the identical attachment site in mutL have been identified in related species, including Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus parauberis, and Streptococcus canis. These CI have small genomes, which range from 13 to 20 kB, conserved integrase and DNA replication genes, and no identifiable genes encoding capsid proteins. SpyCI may employ a helper phage for packaging and dissemination in a fashion similar to the Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPI). Outside of the core replication and integration genes, SpyCI and related CI show considerable diversity with the presence of many indels that may contribute to the host cell phenotype or fitness. SpyCI are a subset of a larger family of streptococcal CI who potentially regulate the expression of other host genes. The biological and phylogenetic analysis of streptococcal chromosomal islands provides important clues as to how these chromosomal islands help S. pyogenes and other streptococcal species persist in human populations in spite of antibiotic therapy and immune challenges.
TI  - Dual stimulation with bacterial and viral components increases the expression of  hepcidin in human monocytes.
AB  - Hepcidin belongs to the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) family and is the key regulator of iron metabolism. It modulates iron homeostasis by binding to, and degrading the iron exporter molecule, ferroportin, thus inhibiting cellular iron efflux. Many antimicrobial peptides have a dual function; some are able to act directly as an antimicrobial agent as well as having an immunoregulatory role in the host. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind to components of microorganisms, activate cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate innate immune responses. The effect of TLR3 (poly I:C) and TLR9 (CpG) co-stimulation of THP-1-derived monocytes using purified TLR ligands showed that 24 h after exposure poly I:C and CpG ligands in combination, hepcidin expression was significantly increased (10-fold) when compared to the untreated control. This combination of TLR ligands mimics simultaneous bacterial and viral infections, thus suggesting a potential key role for hepcidin in combined infections. Additionally, using a chequerboard assay, we have shown that hepcidin has an antagonistic effect in combination with the antibiotics rifampicin and tetracycline against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyogenes, evidenced by a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) > 4. This finding has important implications for future treatment regimens especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - A prospective, observational, epidemiological evaluation of the aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of acute otitis media in Saudi children younger than 5years of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding acute otitis media (AOM) aetiology is important for developing effective vaccines. Here, bacterial aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of AOM were determined in young Saudi children. METHODS: Children aged 3-60months with a new episode of AOM, who had not received antibiotics or had received antibiotics for 48-72h but remained symptomatic, were enrolled in this prospective, observational, epidemiological study in Riyadh. Middle ear fluid (MEF) samples were collected by tympanocentesis or from spontaneous otorrhea, and tested for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the identified pathogens was assessed using E-tests. RESULTS: Between June 2009 and May 2011, 66 children were enrolled. S. pneumoniae was detected in 6 episodes and non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in 8 episodes. Moreover, Staphylococcus aureus, which is an uncommon cause of AOM, was detected in 17 episodes. Pneumococcal serotypes were 7F (n=2), 23F (n=2), 19F (n=1) and 15F (n=1). Susceptibility to cefotaxime was observed in all pneumococcal and H. influenzae isolates, to cefuroxime in 4/6 pneumococcal and 8/8 H. influenzae isolates, and to penicillin in 5/6 pneumococcal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and NTHi were major bacterial contributors for AOM in Saudi children.
TI  - Parasitic scabies mites and associated bacteria joining forces against host complement defence.
AB  - Scabies is a ubiquitous and contagious skin disease caused by the parasitic mite  Sarcoptes scabiei Epidemiological studies have identified scabies as a causative agent for secondary skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This is an important notion, as such bacterial infections can lead to serious downstream life-threatening complications. As the complement system is the first line of host defence that confronts invading pathogens, both the mite and bacteria produce a large array of molecules that inhibit the complement cascades. It is hypothesised that scabies mite complement inhibitors may play an important role in providing a favourable micro-environment for the establishment of secondary bacterial infections. This review aims to bring together the current literature on complement inhibition by scabies mites and bacteria associated with scabies and to discuss the proposed molecular link between scabies and bacterial co-infections.
TI  - Vaccination against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes prevents death after  influenza virus: S. pyogenes super-infection.
AB  - Influenza virus infections are associated with a significant number of illnesses  and deaths on an annual basis. Many of the deaths are due to complications from secondary bacterial invaders, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The beta-hemolytic bacteria S. pyogenes colonizes both skin and respiratory surfaces, and frequently presents clinically as strep throat or impetigo. However, when these bacteria gain access to normally sterile sites, they can cause deadly diseases including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia. We previously developed a model of influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection, which we used to demonstrate that vaccination against influenza virus can limit deaths associated with a secondary bacterial infection, but this protection was not complete. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine that targets the M protein of S. pyogenes to determine whether immunity toward the bacteria alone would allow the host to survive an influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection. Our data demonstrate that vaccination against the M protein induces IgG antibodies, in particular those of the IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, and that these antibodies can interact with macrophages. Ultimately, this vaccine-induced immunity eliminated death within our influenza virus:S. pyogenes super-infection model, despite the fact that all M protein-vaccinated mice showed signs of illness following influenza virus inoculation. These findings identify immunity against bacteria as an important component of protection against influenza virus:bacteria super-infection.
TI  - Fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  - Skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. Additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by Gram-negative species. Topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. In such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. However, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of sensitization are not uncommon. As a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. Fusidic acid (FA) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, FA reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that FA, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against S. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corinebatteria, Clostridia. Additionally, FA presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. Such feature makes FA particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. Finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, FA has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. Overall, data on FA efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - [Species and quantitative characteristics of pharyngeal mucosa microflora in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Species and quantitative characteristics of upper respiratory tract (URT) mucosa microflora in women at gestation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of a bacteriological study of 68 samples of mucus from posterior pharyngeal wall in women at gestation period (from 14 weeks), 52 of those--from pregnant women with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and 16--from women without signs of disease, are presented. Qualitative and quantitative composition of microflora was studied by a generally accepted bacteriological method. RESULTS: During primary bacteriological study 111 microorganism cultures were isolated. 88 (79.3%) of strains belonged to Gram-positive flora, 20 (18.0%)--to Gram-negative, and Candida genus fungi constituted 3 (2.7%) isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from pregnant women with ARI signs at 23.1% and 5.8% frequency of occurrence, respectively. A higher detectability of Staphylococcus aureus--in 31.3% and Candida spp.--in 6.3% of women who did not complain as opposed to patients with URT lesions (in 21.2 and 3.9%, respectively) was determined. In patients without ARI signs the amount of bacteria did not exceed 10(5)--10(6) CFU/ml, in pregnant women with ARI diagnosis in 8 of 52 cases semination of pharyngeal mucuswas observed--10(7)--10(8) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans in composition of pharyngeal mucus microflora of pregnant women both with URT lesion signs and without them was shown, however the degree of semination by pathogens in the groups was different that determined the severity of disease manifestations.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. Nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. We hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that AMPs might effectively protect the pleural cavity. METHODS: Pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. Antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. AMPs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemical analysis. The impact of proinflammatory triggers on AMP release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. They effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes). A variety of AMPs was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. They mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. Although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, AMP expression could not be augmented by Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence of a high abundance of AMPs in postoperative pleural fluids. Our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.
TI  - Novel copper (II) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  - The incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. In this work, copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. In the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (II) (Cu(2+)) sulfate solution. In the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding Cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. Alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and Cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low pH provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior. An increase in either Cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption. The hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to the Cu(2+) ion concentration. Blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. Conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.
TI  - Subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Camels migrate between the open boundaries of Sudan and Egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections. METHODOLOGY: Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. RESULTS: A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%), Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.
TI  - Subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. A small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. This review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. Understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.
TI  - Hospitalist perspective on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - The prevalence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has been increasing in  the United States. These infections are associated with an increase in hospital admissions. Hospitalists play an increasingly important role in the management of these infections and need to use hospital resources efficiently and effectively. When available, observation units are useful for treating low-risk patients who do not require hospital admission. Imaging tools may help to exclude abscesses and necrotizing soft tissue infections; however, surgical exploration remains the principal means of diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. The most common pathogens that cause SSTIs are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) is a prevalent pathogen, and concerns are increasing regarding the unclear distinctions between community-acquired and hospital-acquired MRSA. Other less frequent pathogens that cause SSTIs include Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cephalexin and clindamycin are suitable options for infections caused by streptococcal species and methicillin-susceptible S aureus. The increasing resistance of S aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to erythromycin limits its use in these infections, and better alternatives are available. Parenteral cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin can be used in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis caused by streptococci and methicillin-susceptible S aureus. When oral MRSA therapy is indicated, clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid is appropriate. Vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, telavancin, and ceftaroline fosamil are intravenous options that should be used in MRSA infections that require patient hospitalization. In the treatment of patients with SSTIs, hospitalists are at the forefront of providing proper patient care that reduces hospital costs, duration of therapy, and therapeutic failures. This review updates guidelines on the management of SSTIs with a focus on infections caused by S aureus, particularly MRSA, and outlines the role of the hospitalist in the effective management of SSTIs.
TI  - Susceptibility of common bacterial respiratory pathogens to antimicrobial agents  in outpatients from South Backa District.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute infections of the upper respiratory tract are the most common reasons why patients visit general practitioners. Overuse of antibiotics in treatment of these conditions is extremely common practice although these infections are most frequently caused by viruses. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and susceptibility of common pathogens to antimicrobial agents that cause infections of the upper respiratory tract in outpatients and to determine whether the results obtained from the examined sample were in accordance with the recommendations of the current National Guideline. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 945 strains isolated from the throat and nasal swabs from January 1st to March 31st, 2008, as well as from 330 strains isolated from January 1st to March 31st, 2013 in South Backa District, Serbia. Susceptibility tests were performed by the standard disc diffusion method and according to the criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated strains were Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branchamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Branchamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae to examined antibiotics did not substantially change over the two study periods. None of the isolates of Staphylococcus aures demonstrated resistance to methicillin in 2008, while the percentage of resistant strains was 5.93% in 2013. Susceptibility rates of Staphylococcus pneumoniae isolates to erythromycin and clindamycin were lower in 2013 than in 2008. CONCLUSION: The investigation results follow the recommendations of the National Guideline for the usage of natural penicillin in the treatment of tonsillopharyngitis. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is recommended for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, and second generation cephalosporins are the second choice.
TI  - [Superficial skin infections and bacterial dermohypodermitis].
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the two main bacteria involved in skin infections in children. Mild infections like limited impetigo and furonculosis should preferentially be treated by topical antibiotics (mupirocine or fucidic acid). Empiric antimicrobial therapy of dermohypodermitis consists in amoxicillin-clavulanate through oral route (80 mg/kg/d) or parenteral route (150 mg/kg amoxicillin per d. in 3-4 doses) for complicated features: risk factors of extension of the infection, sepsis or fast evolution. Clindamycin (40 mg/kg/d per d. in 3 doses) should be added to the beta-lactam treatment in case of toxinic shock, surgical necrotizing soft tissues or fasciitis infections.
TI  - A scabies mite serpin interferes with complement-mediated neutrophil functions and promotes staphylococcal growth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The disease is highly prevalent worldwide and known to predispose to secondary bacterial infections, in particular by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Reports of scabies patients co-infected with methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pose a major concern for serious down-stream complications. We previously reported that a range of complement inhibitors secreted by the mites promoted the growth of S. pyogenes. Here, we show that a recently characterized mite serine protease inhibitor (SMSB4) inhibits the complement-mediated blood killing of S. aureus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood killing of S. aureus was measured in whole blood bactericidal assays, counting viable bacteria recovered after treatment in fresh blood containing active complement and phagocytes, treated with recombinant SMSB4. SMSB4 inhibited the blood killing of various strains of S. aureus including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive isolates. Staphylococcal growth was promoted in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the effect of SMSB4 on the complement-mediated neutrophil functions, namely phagocytosis, opsonization and anaphylatoxin release, by flow cytometry and in enzyme linked immuno sorbent assays (ELISA). SMSB4 reduced phagocytosis of S. aureus by neutrophils. It inhibited the deposition of C3b, C4b and properdin on the bacteria surface, but did not affect the depositions of C1q and MBL. SMSB4 also inhibited C5 cleavage as indicated by a reduced C5b-9 deposition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We postulate that SMSB4 interferes with the activation of all three complement pathways by reducing the amount of C3 convertase formed. We conclude that SMSB4 interferes with the complement-dependent killing function of neutrophils, thereby reducing opsonization, phagocytosis and further recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. As a consequence secreted scabies mites complement inhibitors, such as SMSB4, provide favorable conditions for the onset of S. aureus co-infection in the scabies-infected microenvironment by suppressing the immediate host immune response.
TI  - Efficient synthesis of eudistomin U and evaluation of its cytotoxicity.
AB  - Eudistomin U is a member of a subclass of naturally occurring indole alkaloids known as beta-carbolines. These molecules are reported to have diverse biological activity and high binding affinity to DNA, which make them attractive targets for total synthesis. We describe an efficient, five-step synthesis of eudistomin U by employing two key reactions: a Bischler-Napieralski cyclization and a Suzuki cross coupling. We also describe the cytotoxicity of eudistomin U against various cancer cell lines and human pathogens, in which we observed potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Effects of natural honey on polymicrobial culture of various human pathogens.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Honey has a wide range of antimicrobial activity. All previous studies have considered honey's effect on a single microbe. The present study investigated activity of honey towards a high dose of single or polymicrobial culture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 10 microl specimens of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Candida albicans (C. albicans) were cultured in 10 ml of 10-100% (wt/v) honey diluted in broth. Six types of polymicrobial microbial cultures were prepared by culturing the isolates with each other onto broth (control) and broth containing various concentrations of honey (10-100% wt/v). Microbial growth was assessed on solid plate media after 24 h incubation. RESULTS: Honey (30-70%) prevents growth of 10 microl specimens of all the isolates. Greater reduction in growth of E. coli was observed when cultured with S. aureus. Culturing of S. aureus with S. pyogenes, C. albicans, or E. coli increased its sensitivity to honey. S. aureus and S. pyogenes increased sensitivity of C. albicans to honey while E. coli and C. albicans decreased sensitivity of S. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: It might be concluded that honey prevents and inhibits growth of single and polymicrobial pathogenic cultures. Polymicrobial culture affects growth of the isolates and increases their sensitivity to honey.
TI  - Scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. Scabies mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. Epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. It is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the opportunistic pathogens. A longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. In a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with S. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. A total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16S rDNA tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. We found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in Staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. This increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. Furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted from the commensal S. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to S. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. In contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of Staphylococcus throughout the trial. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first experimental in vivo evidence supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. Our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. The methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. Studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against the mites and the secondary infections.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome surveillance in UK children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute toxin-mediated illness caused  by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. There is no recent data regarding incidence, management and mortality of TSS in UK children. METHODS: Consultants from paediatric and burns units in the UK and Ireland, reported cases of TSS seen between November 2008 and December 2009, via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Respondents were sent questionnaires requesting detailed information about TSS cases. Established criteria were used to divide cases into staphylococcal or streptococcal TSS. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases were identified overall; 29 cases of streptococcal TSS (18 confirmed and 11 probable) and 20 cases of staphylococcal TSS (15 confirmed and 5 probable). The incidence of TSS children in the UK & the Republic of Ireland was calculated to be 0.38 per 100 000 children. Children with staphylococcal TSS were older than those with streptococcal TSS (9.5 vs 3.8 years; p<0.003). Paediatric intensive care facilities were used for 78% of cases (invasive ventilatory support 69%; inotropic support 67%; haemofiltration 12%). Agents with antitoxin effects were underused; clindamycin 67%, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 20%, fresh frozen plasma 40%. There were eight deaths, all in the streptococcal group (28% of streptococcal cases)-none were given IVIG. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcal TSS was as frequent as staphylococcal TSS, contrasting with previous literature. Children with streptococcal TSS had a higher mortality than those with staphylococcal TSS (28% vs 0%; p<0.05). Recommended immunomodulatory agents (IVIG and clindamycin) were underused. This study highlights the need for a guideline to improve management of TSS in children.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, theoretical, anti-bacterial and molecular docking studies of quinoline based chalcones as a DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - A series of fourteen (A1-A14) new qunioline based chalcones were synthesized by condensing 2,7-dichloro-8-methyl-3-formyl quinoline with acetophenone and acetylthiophenes, and subsequently characterized by IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy. All the compounds were screened for antibacterial activities and found potentially active antibacterial agents. Bioassay, theoretical and dockings studies with DNA gyrase (the enzyme required for super coiling of DNA of bacteria) results showed that the type and positions of the substituents seemed to be critical for their antibacterial activities. The bromo and chloro substituted chalcone displayed high anti-bacterial activity. The A4 and A6 showed high interaction with DNA gyrase, contributing high free binding energy (DeltaG -8.18 and -8.88 kcal).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of new N-3 substituted thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives bearing the pyrazole moiety.
AB  - Two new series of N-3 substituted thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives bearing the  pyrazole moiety (5a-j and 7a-j) were synthesized and assessed in vitro for their efficacy as antibacterial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Among the tested compounds, 7b, 7c, 7i, and 7j were found to be active against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range of 6.25-25 microg/mL, and some compounds were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Compounds 7c and 7j inhibited the growth of MRSA at MIC values of 6.25 and 12.5 microg/mL, respectively. The influence of the lipophilicity (C log P) on the biological profile (MIC) of the prepared products was also discussed. From the standpoint of structure-activity relationship studies, it was observed that the lipophilic profiles of the compounds were crucial for their antibacterial activities. Further, the results of the MTT cytotoxicity studies on a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (NIH 3T3) suggested that compounds 7b, 7c, 7i, and 7j were endowed with low levels of cytotoxicity.
TI  - A recent case of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis--presentation to definitive reconstruction within an in-theater combat hospital setting.
AB  - First described in 1924, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing, severe suppurative infection of the superficial fascia, often associated with vascular thrombosis and necrosis of the overlying skin. Despite advances in medical therapy, the mortality remains high, with rates exceeding 25 to 50% in some studies. Early diagnosis and treatment is paramount in the management of this serious infection and should include wide surgical debridement and drainage of all necrotic tissues, coupled with aggressive parenteral antibiotics. This infectious process has been commonly associated with traumatic events in patients with compromised immune systems, diabetes, chronic steroid use, and alcoholism. The common microbacterial organisms associated with necrotizing fasciitis include Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and less commonly, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. Most cases typically present in the extremities, trunk, and/or groin regions. Although this virulent soft tissue infection can occur within the face and neck areas, cases of isolated periorbital NF have been relatively uncommon. However, head and neck cases of NF have had high associated morbidity and mortality rates. In recent publications, the reported mortality rate for isolated periorbital NF was not insignificant, ranging from 8.5 to 12.5%. The prognosis, morbidity, and mortality rates will be greatly increased in those patients who present late in the infectious phase, have a delay in diagnosis and/or treatment, or who demonstrate extension of this virulent infection into the face, cervical, or sternal/mediastinal regions. An aggressive multimodal approach is required in treating periorbital necrotizing infection, with the main tenant remaining wide and adequate surgical debridement of affected tissues. This difficult clinical situation can create a subsequent challenge with respect to achieving good functional and cosmetic outcomes in those patients with periorbital NF. Delayed reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts and/or facial flaps is often required to avoid late complications such as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malposition, exposure keratopathy, and potential loss of vision. We describe a patient who presented to a military combat hospital with a virulent periorbital soft tissue infection. We have outlined his treatment course from the initial presentation through definitive reconstruction.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes sternoclavicular septic arthritis in a healthy adult.
AB  - Sternoclavicular septic arthritis is a rare infection, accounting for approximately 1% of septic arthritis in the general population. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant etiologic agent, and it usually occurs in relatively young adults with some type of predisposition to infection. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of group A streptococcal, sternoclavicular arthritis in a previously healthy 62-year-old male patient. We present a detailed history and physical examination, with laboratory findings, imaging studies, cultures, and therapy.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Cutaneous bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus  pyogenes in infants and children.
AB  - Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in children. The medical burden of SSSIs, particularly abscesses, has increased nationwide since the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SSSIs represent a wide spectrum of disease severity. Prompt recognition, timely institution of appropriate therapy, and judicious antimicrobial use optimize patient outcomes. For abscesses, incision and drainage are paramount and might avoid the need for antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated cases. If indicated, empiric antimicrobial therapy should target Streptococcus pyogenes for nonpurulent SSSIs, such as uncomplicated cellulitis, and S aureus for purulent SSSIs such as abscesses.
TI  - [Skin and soft tissue infections in children: consensus on diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections are a common reason for consultation in primary health care centers. Data from the local epidemiology of these infections are rare, but Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are known to be the major etiologic agents. The appearance in recent years of community-originated strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and erythromycin-resistant pyogenes raises controversy in the choice of initial empirical treatment. This national consensus is for pediatricians, dermatologists, infectologists and other health professionals. It is about clinical management, especially the diagnosis and treatment of community-originated skin and soft tissue infections in immunocompetent patients under the age of 19.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of Emex spinosa (L.) Campd. extract.
AB  - The current research was designed to evaluate the phytochemical contents, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity of Emex spinosa extracts. The different plant extracts and Aloe-emodin glucoside were screened using the colorimetric MTT method (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide) assay to test their in vitro cytotoxic activity against HepG2, MCF-7, Caco-2 and HCT. The clinically used anticancer drug doxorubicin was used as standard for comparative purposes. Anthraquinones (Aloe-emodin-O-glucoside, Emodin and nataloin (1, 2, 8-trihydroxy, 6-methyl, 10-anthrone-C-glucoside) together with beta-sistosterol and beta-sitisterol-O-beta-D-glucoside were isolated from Emex spinosa. Aloe-emodin glucoside together with four fractions from this plant were evaluated for their anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Aloe-emodin glucoside showed anticancer activity against HCT, HepG-2, MCF-7 and Caco-2 cell lines. The total ethanol extract of E. spinosa and diethyl ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol fractions shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Comparative studies on genital infections and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates from camels (Camelus dromedarius) and cows (Bos indicus) in Maiduguri, north-eastern Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 160 genitalia of Camels and cows were investigated in Maiduguri, north-eastern Nigeria to compare bacterial isolates and the antibacterial susceptibilities of some of the isolates. Streptococcus (Str.) pyogenes (31%), Escherichia (E.) coli (24%) and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (20%) were the most common vaginal bacterial isolates in camels; while E. coli (73%), Str. pyogenes (18%) and S. aureus (11%) were the most frequent isolates in the cows. Of the 78 uterine isolates recovered in this study, E. coli was the most prominent in camels (8%) and cows (54%). The overall weight of genital infection in all camels and cows examined was highest (P < 0.05) with E. coli (79%), but there was no difference (P > 0.05) between vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates from camels and cows in this study. The Relative Risk (RR) for an infection of the vagina with E coli (3.04, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.104 to 4.398, P < 0.0001) is more in cows compared to the camel, but the RR for vaginal infection with S. aureus and Str. pyogenes were lower in cows compared to Camels. The E. coli and S. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. Therefore effective management of reproductive disorders associated with these pathogens can be achieved with proper use of these antimicrobial agents in these animal species.
TI  - [Skin and soft tissue infections in children: consensus on diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections are a common reason for consultation in primary health care centers. Data from the local epidemiology of these infections are rare, but Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are known to be the major etiologic agents. The appearance in recent years of community-originated strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and erythromycin-resistant pyogenes raises controversy in the choice of initial empirical treatment. This national consensus is for pediatricians, dermatologists, infectiologists and other health professionals. It is about clinical management, especially the diagnosis and treatment of community-originated skin and soft tissue infections in immunocompetent patients under the age of 19.
TI  - Evaluation of the extract of Zeyheria tuberculosa with a view to products for wound healing.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and healing activities of the ethanolic extract of the stems of Z. tuberculosa via topical use and/or oral ingestion. METHOD: antimicrobial assays in vitro using the disk diffusion method, the Artemia salina toxicity test, and in vivo assays with Wistar rats. From these was collected clinical, histological and biochemical data for evaluating the healing process. RESULTS: in vitro antimicrobial testing showed activity in relation to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with zones of inhibition of 18, 14 and 10 mm, respectively. The best minimum inhibitory concentration was 62.5 microg/ml for S. aureus, this bacteria being chosen for the in vitro assays. Animals treated with the ointments with the extract of Z. tuberculosa showed the best results in the reduction of the wound diameter, data confirmed by the presence of re-epithelialization in the histological samples. CONCLUSION: the extract was shown to be promising for the continuation of studies which may identify the active ingredients responsible for the pharmacological activity and its mechanism of action in the process of wound healing, so as to develop a product which may be used as an alternate means in the repair of infected cutaneous wounds.
TI  - Optimal insemination and replacement decisions to minimize the cost of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - Mastitis is a serious production-limiting disease, with effects on milk yield, milk quality, and conception rate, and an increase in the risk of mortality and culling. The objective of this study was 2-fold: (1) to develop an economic optimization model that incorporates all the different types of pathogens that cause clinical mastitis (CM) categorized into 8 classes of culture results, and account for whether the CM was a first, second, or third case in the current lactation and whether the cow had a previous case or cases of CM in the preceding lactation; and (2) to develop this decision model to be versatile enough to add additional pathogens, diseases, or other cow characteristics as more information becomes available without significant alterations to the basic structure of the model. The model provides economically optimal decisions depending on the individual characteristics of the cow and the specific pathogen causing CM. The net returns for the basic herd scenario (with all CM included) were $507/cow per year, where the incidence of CM (cases per 100 cow-years) was 35.6, of which 91.8% of cases were recommended for treatment under an optimal replacement policy. The cost per case of CM was $216.11. The CM cases comprised (incidences, %) Staphylococcus spp. (1.6), Staphylococcus aureus (1.8), Streptococcus spp. (6.9), Escherichia coli (8.1), Klebsiella spp. (2.2), other treated cases (e.g., Pseudomonas; 1.1), other not treated cases (e.g., Trueperella pyogenes; 1.2), and negative culture cases (12.7). The average cost per case, even under optimal decisions, was greatest for Klebsiella spp. ($477), followed by E. coli ($361), other treated cases ($297), and other not treated cases ($280). This was followed by the gram-positive pathogens; among these, the greatest cost per case was due to Staph. aureus ($266), followed by Streptococcus spp. ($174) and Staphylococcus spp. ($135); negative culture had the lowest cost ($115). The model recommended treatment for most CM cases (>85%); the range was 86.2% (Klebsiella spp.) to 98.5% (Staphylococcus spp.). In general, the optimal recommended time for replacement was up to 5 mo earlier for cows with CM compared with cows without CM. Furthermore, although the parameter estimates implemented in this model are applicable to the dairy farms in this study, the parameters may be altered to be specific to other dairy farms. Cow rankings and values based on disease status, pregnancy status, and milk production can be extracted; these provide guidance when determining which cows to keep or cull.
TI  - Influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of Candida albicans.
AB  - PURPOSE: Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in  human microflora. Biofilm formation (BF) is known as a major virulence factor of C. albicans. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of C. albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BF of Candida was investigated when it was co-cultured with C. albicans (C. albicans 53, a yeast with a low BF ability, and C. albicans 163, a yeast with high BF ability) and bacteria. BF was assessed with XTT reduction assay. A scanning electron microscope was used to determine the structure of the biofilm, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify and quantify hyphae-associated genes. RESULTS: Co-culturing with two different types of bacteria increased the BF value. Co-culturing with C. albicans 53 and 163 also increased the BF value compared to the value that was obtained when the C. albicans was cultured individually. However, co-culturing with bacteria decreased the BF value of C. albicans, and the BF of C. albicans 163 was markedly inhibited. The expression of adherence and morphology transition related genes were significantly inhibited by co-culturing with live bacteria. CONCLUSION: Bacteria have a negative effect on the formation of biofilm by C. albicans. This mechanism is the result of the suppression of genes associated with the hyphae transition of C. albicans, and bacteria particles physically affected the biofilm architecture and biofilm formation.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Montmorillonite-chitosan-silver sulfadiazine nanocomposites for topical treatment of chronic skin lesions: in vitro biocompatibility, antibacterial efficacy and gap closure cell motility properties.
AB  - Silver compounds and especially silver sulfadiazine (AgSD) are reported as effective antimicrobial agents against almost all known bacteria, fungi and some viruses. However, AgSD has been shown to be cytotoxic toward fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro and consequently to retard wound healing in vivo. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility (cytotoxicity and proliferation), antimicrobial efficacy and cell motility gap closure (assay of wound closure) of MT/CS nanocomposites loaded with silver sulfadiazine (AgSD). It is envisioned to be administered as a powder or a dressing for cutaneous application in the treatment of skin ulcers. The loading of AgSD in MT/CS nanocomposites aimed at preventing the delay in wound healing, by decreasing the cytotoxicity of AgSD and maintaining its antimicrobial properties. Nanocomposites were prepared by using different amounts of MT (100-2000 mg) and 40 ml of a 1% (w/w) chitosan glutamate aqueous solution. The relative amounts of AgSD and chitosan in the systems were assessed by suitable analytic methods. The nanocomposite prepared using 100mg of MT was characterized for in vitro biocompatibility and proliferation and for wound healing using normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Antimicrobial properties were evaluated against four reference bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AgSD loaded in the 100 MT/CS nanocomposite showed good in vitro biocompatibility and gap closure properties (fibroblasts) and maintained AgSD antimicrobial properties, especially against P. aeruginosa, that often complicates skin lesions.
TI  - Soluble T cell receptor Vbeta domains engineered for high-affinity binding to staphylococcal or streptococcal superantigens.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus secrete a collection of toxins called superantigens (SAgs), so-called because they stimulate a large fraction of an individual's T cells. One consequence of this hyperactivity is massive cytokine release leading to severe tissue inflammation and, in some cases, systemic organ failure and death. The molecular basis of action involves the binding of the SAg to both a T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell and a class II product of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on an antigen presenting cell. This cross-linking leads to aggregation of the TCR complex and signaling. A common feature of SAgs is that they bind with relatively low affinity to the variable region (V) of the beta chain of the TCR. Despite this low affinity binding, SAgs are very potent, as each T cell requires only a small fraction of their receptors to be bound in order to trigger cytokine release. To develop high-affinity agents that could neutralize the activity of SAgs, and facilitate the development of detection assays, soluble forms of the Vbeta regions have been engineered to affinities that are up to 3 million-fold higher for the SAg. Over the past decade, six different Vbeta regions against SAgs from S. aureus (SEA, SEB, SEC3, TSST-1) or S. pyogenes (SpeA and SpeC) have been engineered for high-affinity using yeast display and directed evolution. Here we review the engineering of these high-affinity Vbeta proteins, structural features of the six different SAgs and the Vbeta proteins, and the specific properties of the engineered Vbeta regions that confer high-affinity and specificity for their SAg ligands.

TI  - Antioxidative potential of folate producing probiotic Lactobacillus helveticus CD6.
AB  - Folate producing Lactobacillus sp. CD6 isolated from fermented milk showed 98% similarity with Lactobacillus helveticus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It was found to produce a folic acid derivative 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF). The intracellular cell-free extract of strain demonstrated antioxidative activity with the inhibition rate of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 27.5% +/- 3.7%. It showed highest metal ion chelation ability for Fe(2+) (0.26 +/- 0.06 ppm) as compared to Cu(2+). The DPPH (alpha,alpha-Diphenyl-beta-Picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity for intact cells were found to be 24.7% +/- 10.9% proved its antioxidative potential. Furthermore, it demonstrated 14.89% inhibition of epinephrine autoxidation, 20.9 +/- 1.8 mug cysteine equivalent reducing activity and 20.8% +/- 0.9% hydroxyl radical scavenging effect. The strain was evaluated for probiotic properties as per WHO and FAO guidelines. It showed 90.61% survival at highly acidic condition (pH 2.0), 90.66% viability in presence of synthetic gastric juice and 68% survivability at 0.5% bile concentration for 24 h. It was susceptible to many antibiotics which reduces the prospect to offer resistance determinants to other organisms if administered in the form of probiotic preparations. It showed in vitro mucus binding and antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium (NCIM 2501), Streptococcus pyogenes (NCIM 2608), and Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM 5021) and moreover it showed non- hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar.
TI  - Mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production but fail to improve survival in experimental staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by an overwhelming host-mediated response to bacterial superantigens produced mainly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. TSS is characterized by aberrant activation of T cells and excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines ultimately resulting in capillary leak, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction and high mortality rates. No therapeutic or vaccine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for TSS, and novel therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcome are needed. Mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) are stromal cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation. Moreover, MSCs have immunomodulatory properties, including profound effects on activities of T cells and macrophages in specific contexts. Based on the critical role of host-derived immune mediators in TSS, we hypothesized that MSCs could modulate the host-derived proinflammatory response triggered by Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and improve survival in experimental TSS. METHODS: Effects of MSCs on proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood were measured in wild-type C57BL/6 mice injected with 50 mug of SEB. Effects of MSCs on survival were monitored in fatal experimental TSS induced by consecutive doses of D-galactosamine (10 mg) and SEB (10 mug) in HLA-DR4 transgenic mice. RESULTS: Despite significantly decreasing serum levels of IL-2, IL-6 and TNF induced by SEB in wild-type mice, human MSCs failed to improve survival in experimental TSS in HLA-DR4 transgenic mice. Similarly, a previously described downstream mediator of human MSCs, TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), did not significantly improve survival in experimental TSS. Furthermore, murine MSCs, whether unstimulated or pre-treated with IFNgamma, failed to improve survival in experimental TSS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are insufficient to rescue mice from experimental TSS, and that mediators other than IL-2, IL-6 and TNF are likely to play critical mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of experimental TSS.
TI  - Pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (CM) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in Holstein cows. The first 3 CM cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. Eight categories of pathogens were included: Streptococcus spp.; Staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; cases with CM signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included Citrobacter, Corynebacterium bovis, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Pasteurella, Pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (Trueperella pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). Data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 New York State dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. Mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. Primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed. Primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. Fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, CM (type, case number, and timing of CM in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). Herd was modeled as a random effect. Clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. In primiparas, Streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. In multiparas, E. coli was most common as the first case. In subsequent cases, CM cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. The hazard of CM increased with case number. Mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the CM episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. Milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. In primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with E. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. In multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with Klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. Milk loss was not associated with occurrence of CNS. The findings may help farmers to make optimal management decisions for their cows.
TI  - Eco-friendly synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of some novel chalcones.
AB  - Chalcone derivatives have been synthesized by reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethyl-furan-3-yl)-ethanone with corresponding active aldehyde in ethanolic NaOH in microwave oven. The structure of these compounds was established by elemental analysis, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and EI-MS spectral analysis. The anti-bacterial activity of these compounds was first tested in vitro by the disc diffusion assay against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria, and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined with the reference of standard drug Chloramphenicol. The results showed that pyrazol containing chalcone (compound 8) inhibited both types of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) better than chloramphenicol.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in New Zealand children 1994-2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New Zealand is a developed country with high incidence of bacterial infections and postinfectious sequelae including rheumatic heart disease. We sought to describe the clinical and microbiology features of children with infective endocarditis (IE) between 1994 and 2012. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients <16 years identified from hospital records. RESULTS: In total 85 episodes occurred in 82 children and 68 (80%) were classified as Definite IE and 17 as Possible IE according to modified Duke criteria. From Pacific Island countries, 13 cases were referred. There were 72 children who originated in New Zealand, of whom 52% were either indigenous New Zealand Maori or Pacific migrants. The median age at diagnosis was 7 (0-15) years. Of the 85 cases, 51 (60%) had congenital heart disease 10 children with rheumatic heart disease developed IE. Of the 85 cases, 35 (41%) met our criteria for healthcare-associated IE. 39/85 underwent surgery for IE. As direct result of IE, 4 (4.7%) children died and 9% of survivors had neurologic sequelae. Attributable in-hospital mortality was 4.7%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, accounting for 26 episodes (30.6%). Other notable pathogens included Corynebacterium diphtheriae (10 cases, 11.8%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (7 cases, 8.2%). In 6 episodes, the microbiologic diagnosis was made by 16S ribosomal RNA testing of excised cardiac tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital heart disease was the major risk factor for IE; however, rheumatic heart disease is also an important risk factor in New Zealand, with implications for local endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations. In addition to a high burden of healthcare-associated and staphylococcal IE, pathogens such as C. diphtheriae and S. pyogenes occurred. 16S ribosomal RNA testing is a useful tool to determine the etiologic agent in culture-negative IE.
TI  - Reduction of biofilm formation on titanium surface with ultraviolet-C pre-irradiation.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ultraviolet-C irradiation on titanium implants has been recently introduced as photofunctionalization to enhance osseointegration, which possibly also provide anti-microbial function to titanium surface as with photocatalyst. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet-C pre-irradiation to various topographical titanium surfaces on the attachment or biofilm formation of wound pathogens in comparison with that of ultraviolet-A pre-irradiation, with consideration for the physicochemical mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The amount of wound pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes on titanium disks with mirror-polished, turned, acid-etched, or shot-blasted surfaces with or without 500 J/cm2 ultraviolet-A or ultraviolet-C pre-irradiation for 8 h incubation in brain heart infusion broth was evaluated by fluorescence microscopic quantification with 5-cyano-2, 3-ditolyl-2 H-tetrazolium chloride staining for viable bacteria. The surface roughness, wettability, and atomic composition of the surface were evaluated before and after ultraviolet-A or ultraviolet-C irradiation. RESULTS: Regardless of topographies, the amount of bacterial attachment and accumulation was lower on ultraviolet-C pre-irradiated surfaces than on the non-irradiated surface through 8 h incubation. The reducing effect of bacterial accumulation on the roughened surfaces by ultraviolet-A pre-irradiation was inferior to that by ultraviolet-C. Despite no effect on surface topography, ultraviolet-C irradiation changed wettability to superhydrophilicity and reduced carbon contents on any titanium surface with a greater degree than those by ultraviolet-A irradiation. CONCLUSION: Ultraviolet-C irradiation reduced the attachment and biofilm formation of wound pathogens on various topographical titanium surfaces, rivaling or surpassing UVA irradiation in degree. The mechanism might involve superhydrophilicity and carbon elimination on the surface.
TI  - [Antibiotherapy of severe ENT infections in children: complicated sinusitis].
AB  - Intra or extra orbital cellulitis or abscesses are the most frequent bacterial complications of acute sinusitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and anaerobic bacteria are predominant, and more rarelyHaemophilus influenzae (especially since vaccination against type b). Because of bacterial sensitivity, PK/PD parameters of antibiotics, and depending on the classification of Chandler, different probabilistic regimens may be proposed: In class 1 by Chandler (preseptal cellulitis), amoxicillinclavulinate (80 mg/kg/d) in 2 oral doses, and ceftriaxone in intramuscular injection; in cases of class 2 to 5 by Chandler, high doses of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulinate (until 150 mg/kg/d of amoxicillin), or intravenous association of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) or cefotaxim (200 mg/kg/d), with anti-anaerobic like metronidazole (30 mg/kg/d) or clindamycine (40 mg/kg/d).
TI  - [Antibiotherapy of severe ENT infections in children: propositions of the French  Group of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) of the French Society of Pediatrics].
AB  - The French Group of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (PID) of the French Society of  Pediatrics found necessary to issue in 2011 therapeutic proposals concerning antibiotic treatment in severe ENT infections in children (acute mastoiditis, severe sinusitis, peripharyngeal abscess). They took into account, for each clinical situation, published studies and existing guidelines, the most frequently encountered bacterial species, their usual sensitivity to antibiotics, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characteristics. These propositions aim to ensure the proper use of antibiotics and to limit the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by minimizing the use of broadspectrum molecules, especially cephalosporins and penems. These infections are often multi microbial and respond to aerobic flora similar to that found in non severe community acquired ENT infections and soft tissue infections ( Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus(GAS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae). Anaerobic flora may be associated and implicated in some situations. In most cases, high-dosage of amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid offers the best PK/PD profile and allows to avoid the overuse of injectable third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Crystal structure of PfbA, a surface adhesin of Streptococcus pneumoniae, provides hints into its interaction with fibronectin.
AB  - PfbA is a surface adhesin and invasin of Streptococcus pneumoniae that binds to human fibronectin and plasminogen of the host extracellular matrix. It is a virulence factor for its pathogenesis. The crystal structure of recombinant PfbA150-607 from S. pneumoniae strain R6, was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined to 1.90A resolution. The structure of rPfbA150-607 revealed that residues Thr150 to Lys570 form a rigid parallel beta helix, followed by a short disordered region (571-607) that consists of beta hairpins. The structural organization of the beta helix resembles that of polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. The structural and sequence features essential for fibronectin-binding observed in the well characterized fibronectin-binding proteins such as FnBPA of Staphylococcus aureus, SfbI of Streptococcus pyogenes and BBK32 of Borrelia burgdorferi has been found in rPfbA150-607. Based on this, it is predicted that the disordered region following the beta helix could be the fibronectin-binding region in PfbA. PfbA150-607 contains relatively high number of surface exposed lysines and these residues are probably involved in binding plasmin(ogen) as observed in other plasminogen-binding proteins.
TI  - Manuka honey inhibits adhesion and invasion of medically important wound bacteria in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the effect of manuka honey on medically important wound bacteria in vitro, focusing on its antiadhesive properties. MATERIALS & METHODS: Crystal violet biofilm assays, fluorescent microscopy, protein adhesion assay and gentamicin protection assay were used to determine the impact of manuka honey on biofilm formation, human protein binding and adherence to/invasion into human keratinocytes. RESULTS: Manuka honey effectively disrupted and caused extensive cell death in biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sublethal doses of manuka honey inhibited bacterial adhesion to the fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen. Manuka honey impaired adhesion of laboratory and clinical isolates of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pyogenes to human keratinocytes in vitro, and inhibited invasion by S. pyogenes and homogeneous vancomycin intermediate S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Manuka honey can directly affect bacterial cells embedded in a biofilm and exhibits antiadhesive properties against three common wound pathogens.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of alpha-substituted isonipecotic acid benzothiazole analogues as potent bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors.
AB  - The discovery and optimisation of a new class of benzothiazole small molecules that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are described. Antibacterial properties have been demonstrated by activity against DNA gyrase ATPase and potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. Further refinements to the scaffold designed to enhance drug-likeness included analogues bearing an alpha-substituent to the carboxylic acid group, resulting in excellent solubility and favourable pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of alpha-aminoboronic-containing peptidomimetics.

TI  - The contribution of group A streptococcal virulence determinants to the pathogenesis of sepsis.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is responsible for a wide range of pathologies ranging from mild pharyngitis and impetigo to severe invasive soft tissue infections. Despite the continuing susceptibility of the bacterium to beta-lactam antibiotics there has been an unexplained resurgence in the prevalence of invasive GAS infection over the past 30 years. Of particular importance was the emergence of a GAS-associated sepsis syndrome that is analogous to the systemic toxicosis associated with TSST-1 producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Despite being recognized for over 20 years, the etiology of GAS associated sepsis and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remains poorly understood. Here we review the virulence factors that contribute to the etiology of GAS associated sepsis with a particular focus on coagulation system interactions and the role of the superantigens in the development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue infections in the military.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are common in military populations regularly living and training in close contact with each other. The majority of such infections are simple and can be easily treated with antibiotics and appropriate infection control practices. Some, however, can progress to become complex and even life threatening, such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-associated staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, or Streptococcus pyogenes necrotising fasciitis, which carry a mortality rate of up to 65% and 30%, respectively. This review focuses on the most important SSTIs and those more commonly affecting military personnel with advice on how they are best managed.
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in Gabon, Central Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. As these data are scarce for Central Africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in Gabon. METHODS: Microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). RESULTS: A high diversity of pathogens was found, but Staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. Overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were S. aureus (33.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and Escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults S. aureus (23.5%), E. coli (15.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). In total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all K. pneumoniae were ESBL-producer (n = 42). CONCLUSION: The high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in Gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use of antibiotics. Countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.
TI  - A role for the DtxR family of metalloregulators in gram-positive pathogenesis.
AB  - Given the central role of transition metal ions in a variety of biochemical processes, the colonization, survival, and proliferation of a bacterium within a host hinges upon its ability to overcome the metal ion deprivation that characterizes nutritional immunity. Metalloregulatory, or 'metal-sensing' proteins have evolved in bacteria to mediate metal ion homeostasis by activating or repressing the expression of genes encoding metal ion transport systems upon binding their cognate metal ion. Yet increasing evidence in the literature supports an additional role for these metalloregulatory proteins in pathogenesis. Herein, we survey studies on the DtxR family of metalloregulators, namely DtxR (Cornyebacterium diphtheriae), SloR (Streptococcus mutans), MtsR (Streptococcus pyogenes), and MntR (Staphylococcus aureus) to describe how metalloregulation enables adaptive virulence gene expression within the mammalian host. This research has important implications for drug design, as the generation of hyper-repressive metalloregulatory proteins may represent a mechanism by which to attenuate bacterial pathogenicity. The fact that metalloregulators are unique to prokaryotes makes these proteins especially attractive therapeutic targets.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract GH 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - The need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract GH 2002, against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent Stapylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Candida. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal microbicidial concentrations (MMCs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. Propolis extract GH 2002 revealed low MICs in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. faecium and Candida. A high bactericidal activity of propolis extract in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for S. pyogenes and S. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against E. faecium. Propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different Candida species. Whereas all tested MRSA strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against VRE strains. Time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low MICs already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical MRSA strains, but not against VRE strains. In conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. MRSA, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. These results suggest that the special propolis extract GH2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.
TI  - Repeated serum alkaline phosphatase measurements in the treatment of childhood acute bone and joint infections with high doses of antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Site-specific N-terminal labeling of proteins using sortase-mediated reactions.
AB  - This protocol describes the use of sortase-mediated reactions to label the N terminus of any given protein of interest. The sortase recognition sequence, LPXTG (for Streptococcus aureus sortase A) or LPXTA (for Staphylococcus pyogenes sortase A), can be appended to a variety of probes such as fluorophores, biotin or even to other proteins. The protein to be labeled acts as a nucleophile by attacking the intermediate formed between the probe containing the LPXTG/A motif and the sortase enzyme. If sortase, the protein of interest and a suitably functionalized label are available, the reactions usually require less than 3 h.
TI  - Impact of bacteria and bacterial components on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
AB  - Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are present in several tissues, e.g. bone marrow, heart muscle, brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In invasive infections MSC get in contact with bacteria and bacterial components. Not much is known about how bacterial pathogens interact with MSC and how contact to bacteria influences MSC viability and differentiation potential. In this study we investigated the impact of three different wound infection relevant bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes, and the cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Gram-negative bacteria) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA; Gram-positive bacteria) on viability, proliferation, and osteogenic as well as adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (adMSC). We show that all three tested species were able to attach to and internalize into adMSC. The heat-inactivated Gram-negative E. coli as well as LPS were able to induce proliferation and osteogenic differentiation but reduce adipogenic differentiation of adMSC. Conspicuously, the heat-inactivated Gram-positive species showed the same effects on proliferation and adipogenic differentiation, while its cell wall component LTA exhibited no significant impact on adMSC. Therefore, our data demonstrate that osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adMSC is influenced in an oppositional fashion by bacterial antigens and that MSC-governed regeneration is not necessarily reduced under infectious conditions.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Menaquinone analogs inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. We initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. Menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes Q1 to Q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme Q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. Coenzyme Q1 reduced the ability of S. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four Gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit S. aureus growth. The staphylococcal two-component system SrrA/B was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme Q1. We hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. These compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils of Eremanthus erythropappus (DC) McLeisch (Asteraceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts of Eremanthus erythropappus, including leaves, branches and inflorescences, was investigated by Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity of the oils was assessed by the disc diffusion and microdilution methods, while the antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH and reducing power tests. The main compounds found in the essential oils derived from the inflorescences and leaves were beta-caryophyllene, germacrene-D, alpha-copaene and beta-pinene. alpha-Bisabolol was the major component in the branches. The oils were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and fungi, but not Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The MIC values ranged from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/mL. Using the DPPH test, the IC50 values ranged from 38.77 +/- 0.76 to 102.24 +/- 1.96 mug/mL, while the reducing power test produced IC50 values between 109.85 +/- 1.68 and 169.53 +/- 0.64 mug/mL. The results revealed that the E. erythropappus oils are new promising potential sources of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds with good future practical applications for human health.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Identification of intracellular bacteria in adenoid and tonsil tissue specimens:  the efficiency of culture versus fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).
AB  - Monocyte/macrophage cells from human nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue can be a source of bacteria responsible for human chronic and recurrent upper respiratory tract infection. Detection and characterization of pathogens surviving intracellularly could be a key element in bacteriological diagnosis of the infections as well as in the study on interactions between bacteria and their host. The present study was undertaken to assess the possibility of isolation of viable bacteria from the cells expressing monocyte/macrophage marker CD14 in nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue. Overall, 74 adenotonsillectomy specimens (adenoids and tonsils) from 37 children with adenoid hypertrophy and recurrent infections as well as 15 specimens from nine children with adenoid hypertrophy, which do not suffer from upper respiratory tract infections (the control group), were studied. The suitability of immunomagnetic separation for extraction of CD14(+) cells from lymphoid tissue and for further isolation of the intracellular pathogens has been shown. The coexistence of living pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes with the bacteria representing normal nasopharyngeal microbiota inside CD14(+) cells was demonstrated. Twenty-four strains of these pathogens from 32.4 % of the lysates of CD14(+) cells were isolated. Concurrently, the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a universal EUB388, and the species-specific probes demonstrated twice more often the persistence of these bacterial species in the lysates of CD14(+) cells than conventional culture. Although the FISH technique appears to be more sensitive than traditional culture in the intracellular bacteria identification, the doubts on whether the bacteria are alive, and therefore, pathogenic would still exist without the strain cultivation.
TI  - The thioredoxin antioxidant system.
AB  - The thioredoxin (Trx) system, which is composed of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin, is a key antioxidant system in defense against oxidative stress through its disulfide reductase activity regulating protein dithiol/disulfide balance. The Trx system provides the electrons to thiol-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with a fast reaction rate. Trx antioxidant functions are also shown by involvement in DNA and protein repair by reducing ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductases, and regulating the activity of many redox-sensitive transcription factors. Moreover, Trx systems play critical roles in the immune response, virus infection, and cell death via interaction with thioredoxin-interacting protein. In mammalian cells, the cytosolic and mitochondrial Trx systems, in which TrxRs are high molecular weight selenoenzymes, together with the glutathione-glutaredoxin (Grx) system (NADPH, glutathione reductase, GSH, and Grx) control the cellular redox environment. Recently mammalian thioredoxin and glutathione systems have been found to be able to provide the electrons crossly and to serve as a backup system for each other. In contrast, bacteria TrxRs are low molecular weight enzymes with a structure and reaction mechanism distinct from mammalian TrxR. Many bacterial species possess specific thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, and the significance of the Trx system in the defense against oxidative stress is different. Particularly, the absence of a GSH-Grx system in some pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus makes the bacterial Trx system essential for survival under oxidative stress. This provides an opportunity to kill these bacteria by targeting the TrxR-Trx system.
TI  - [Application of pyrosequencing in detection of common pathogens in sepsis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply pyrosequencing technique in the detection of the common pathogens in sepsis. METHODS: The primers for amplification and sequencing in pyrosequencing were designed according to alignment of the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted for pyrosequencing, and the pathogen species were determined according to the sequencing data obtained. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing effectively yielded the sequencing data of the 28 bp sequences of the pathogens and clearly distinguished the pathogen species of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides, and Salmonella, but failed to distinguish Staphylococcus epidermidis from Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing technique can effectively distinguish the common pathogens in sepsis at the species level.
TI  - Streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  - The role of Streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is considered to be of little relevance. We aimed to describe a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (SVO), to analyze the clinical features associated with different Streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with VO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of SVO (1991-2011) were performed. Statistical comparison of SVO by different species and between them and staphylococcal VO was carried out. Over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of VOs and SVOs per year (p <0.05). Among 58 cases of SVO, those caused by non-viridans streptococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked VO by S. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). In contrast, the latter have a sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis (p <0.05). Among non-viridans SVOs, concomitant infection was specifically related to S. pneumoniae (p <0.05). In conclusion, SVO presents a wide range of clinical patterns. The relationship between VO and diagnosis of endocarditis was established with SVO caused by the viridans group. Whereas non-viridans SVO mimics acute characteristics of VO caused by S. aureus, cases of viridans SVO are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. The increased incidence of SVO during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.
TI  - Combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. Synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro in minimal media. Pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular CoA depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. In spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. In the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. To address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. We found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like N5-Pan and N7-Pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. These results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of some novel thiazole clubbed  1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - A series of thiazole clubbed 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (5a-l) have been synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. Synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The results indicated that, compounds 5c and 5i exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity. Compound 5f was found to be the most potent antifungal agent. The structure activity relationship revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing groups at para position of phenyl ring remarkably enhanced the antibacterial activity of synthesized compounds. Further, the results of preliminary MTT cytotoxicity studies on HeLa cells suggested that potent antimicrobial activity of 5b, 5c, 5f, 5h and 5i is accompanied by low cytotoxicity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome: major advances in pathogenesis, but not treatment.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is primarily the result of a superantigen-mediated cytokine storm and M protein-mediated neutrophil activation, resulting in the release of mediators leading to respiratory failure, vascular leakage, and shock. Mortality for streptococcal TSS still hovers at 50%. There is evidence to support a role for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of streptococcal TSS. An observational study suggests that an initial conservative surgical approach combined with the use of immune modulators, such as IVIG, may reduce the morbidity associated with extensive surgical exploration in hemodynamically unstable patients without increasing mortality.
TI  - Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigen exotoxins.
AB  - SUMMARY This review begins with a discussion of the large family of Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcal pyrogenic toxin T lymphocyte superantigens from structural and immunobiological perspectives. With this as background, the review then discusses the major known and possible human disease associations with superantigens, including associations with toxic shock syndromes, atopic dermatitis, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, and autoimmune sequelae to streptococcal illnesses. Finally, the review addresses current and possible novel strategies to prevent superantigen production and passive and active immunization strategies.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Strain 06BA18369, a Pathogen Associated with Skin and Soft Tissue Infections in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada.
AB  - Here, we announce the draft sequence of a representative methicillin-susceptible  Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolate (06BA18369) whose strain type (spa type t311) was commonly isolated from skin and soft tissue coinfections with Streptococcus pyogenes. This strain sequence provides insight into a highly successful community-associated MSSA strain type.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes Strain 06BA18369, a Human Pathogen Associated with Skin and Soft Tissue Infections in Northern Canada.
AB  - We report the draft sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes 06BA18369 (emm type 41.2,  sequence type 579 [ST579]), isolated from a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) mixed with Staphylococcus aureus. This genome provides insight into the genetic composition of S. pyogenes strains associated with mixed SSTIs.
TI  - Management of a digital world: from felons to fungus.
AB  
TI  - Uptake and intracellular trafficking of superantigens in dendritic cells.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens (SAgs) are exotoxins produced mainly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes that can cause toxic shock syndrome (TSS). According to current paradigm, SAgs interact directly and simultaneously with T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell and MHC class II (MHC-II) on the antigen-presenting cell (APC), thereby circumventing intracellular processing to trigger T cell activation. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs that coat nearly all body surfaces and are the most probable candidate to interact with SAgs. We demonstrate that SAgs are taken up by mouse DCs without triggering DC maturation. SAgs were found in intracellular acidic compartment of DCs as biologically active molecules. Moreover, SAgs co-localized with EEA1, RAB-7 and LAMP-2, at different times, and were then recycled to the cell membrane. DCs loaded with SAgs are capable of triggering in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and, injected into mice, stimulate T cells bearing the proper TCR in draining lymph nodes. Transportation and trafficking of SAgs in DCs might increase the local concentration of these exotoxins where they will produce the highest effect by promoting their encounter with both MHC-II and TCR in lymph nodes, and may explain how just a few SAg molecules can induce the severe pathology associated with TSS.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - The effect of repeated episodes of bacteria-specific clinical mastitis on mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a first and repeated cases of bacteria-specific clinical mastitis (CM) on the risk of mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows. The pathogens studied were Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Trueperella pyogenes, others, and no growth on aerobic culture. A total of 50,166 lactations were analyzed from 5 large, high-milk-producing dairy herds in New York State from 2003/2004 to 2011. Generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of parity, month of lactation, CM, calving diseases, pregnancy status, current season, and economic values on the risk of mortality and culling. Among first-lactation cows, the presence of a first CM case generally exposed cows to a greater risk of mortality in the current month (compared with the absence of a first case). This was especially acute with a first case of Klebsiella spp., where cows were 4.5 times more at risk [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.7-7.6] of mortality, and with a first case of E. coli were 3.3 times more at risk (95% CI: 2.5-4.5). In first-parity cows, the risk of culling generally increased with a case of bacteria-specific CM. This was observed among cows with a first case of T. pyogenes [relative risk=10.4 (95% CI: 8.4-12.8)], a first case of Klebsiella spp. [relative risk=6.7 (95% CI: 5.5-8.1)], a first case of Staph. aureus [relative risk=4.8 (95% CI: 2.7-8.4)], a first case of E. coli [relative risk=3.1 (95% CI: 2.7-3.6)], and a third case of Klebsiella spp. [relative risk=5.0 (95% CI: 3.1-8.0)]. In general, the presence of a first or second/third case resulted in cows in parity >/=2 with a greater risk of mortality. This was greatest for cows with a first case of Klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.7 (95% CI: 3.3-4.3)], followed by a second/third case of Klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.2 (95% CI: 2.5-4.0)], a first case of E. coli [relative risk=3.0 (95% CI: 2.7-3.3)], and a first case of other CM [relative risk=1.8 (95% CI: 1.6-2.0)]. Among cows of parity >/=2, the risk of culling was greater for cows as they progressed through lactations [i.e., cows in parity 4+ were 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0-2.2) times more likely to be culled compared with cows in lactation 2 (the baseline)]. The risk of culling dependent on the cow's characteristics can be easily calculated from the parameter estimates in the provided tables.
TI  - Clinical manifestations and microbiology of acute otitis media with spontaneous otorrhea in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE(S): In Taiwan, clinical and microbiological data on acute otitis media (AOM) with spontaneous otorrhea in children are limited. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on children with AOM and spontaneous otorrhea between January 2011 and June 2012. Otorrhea samples were collected using sterile swabs and sent for cultures. Pathogens found were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Pneumococcal isolates collected from October 2011 to June 2012 were serotyped. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in the study for demographic and microbiological analysis. Their median age was 2.5 years. After excluding those with lobar pneumonia, 84 patients were included for analysis of clinical manifestation. The mean febrile duration was 6 days. Leukocytosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) level >50 mg/L were noted in 29 (34.5%) patients and 38 (45.2%) patients, respectively. Patients with pneumococcal infection were older (p = 0.007) and had more severe symptoms [fever (p = 0.001), otalgia (p = 0.055), respiratory symptoms (p = 0.002-0.03), and higher CRP level (p = 0.015)] than children with other bacterial infection. Otorrhea cultures were obtained from 69 (75%) patients, of whom 52 had definitive AOM pathogens. The most common causative pathogen was S. pneumoniae (61.5%), followed by S. aureus (36.5%). Serotype 19A accounted for two-thirds of pneumococcal isolates and had a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (66.7%) and ceftriaxone (83.3%). CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae was found to be the most important source of AOM with spontaneous otorrhea in children and caused more severe symptoms. Serotype 19A, which was usually nonsusceptible to antimicrobial agents, was the most prevalent serotype in these patients.
TI  - Characterization of molecules binding to the 70K N-terminal region of fibronectin by IFAST purification coupled with mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fibronectin (Fn) is a large glycoprotein present in plasma and extracellular matrix and is important for many processes. Within Fn the 70 kDa N-terminal region (70k-Fn) is involved in cell-mediated Fn assembly, a process that contributes to embryogenesis, development, and platelet thrombus formation. In addition, major human pathogens including Staphlycoccus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bind the 70k-Fn region by a novel form of protein-protein interaction called beta-zipper formation, facilitating bacterial spread and colonization. Knowledge of blood plasma and platelet proteins that interact with 70k-Fn by beta-zipper formation is incomplete. In the current study, we aimed to characterize these proteins through affinity purification. For this affinity purification, we used a novel purification technique termed immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST). The foundation of this technology is immiscible phase filtration, using a magnet to draw paramagnetic particle (PMP)-bound analyte through an immiscible barrier (oil or organic solvent) that separates an aqueous sample from an aqueous eluting buffer. The immiscible barrier functions to remove unbound proteins via exclusion rather than dilutive washing used in traditional isolation methods. We identified 31 interactors from plasma, of which only seven were previously known to interact with Fn. Furthermore, five proteins were identified to interact with 70k-Fn from platelet lysate, of which one was previously known. These results demonstrate that IFAST offers advantages for proteomic studies of interacting molecules in that the technique requires small sample volumes, can be done with high enough throughput to sample multiple interaction conditions, and is amenable to exploratory mass spectrometric and confirmatory immuno-blotting read-outs.
TI  - Antibody to a conserved antigenic target is protective against diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens.
AB  - Microbial capsular antigens are effective vaccines but are chemically and immunologically diverse, resulting in a major barrier to their use against multiple pathogens. A beta-(1-->6)-linked poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) surface capsule is synthesized by four proteins encoded in genetic loci designated intercellular adhesion in Staphylococcus aureus or polyglucosamine in selected Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We report that many microbial pathogens lacking an identifiable intercellular adhesion or polyglucosamine locus produce PNAG, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens, as well as protozoa, e.g., Trichomonas vaginalis, Plasmodium berghei, and sporozoites and blood-stage forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Natural antibody to PNAG is common in humans and animals and binds primarily to the highly acetylated glycoform of PNAG but is not protective against infection due to lack of deposition of complement opsonins. Polyclonal animal antibody raised to deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG and a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that both bind to native and deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG mediated complement-dependent opsonic or bactericidal killing and protected mice against local and/or systemic infections by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, Candida albicans, and P. berghei ANKA, and against colonic pathology in a model of infectious colitis. PNAG is also a capsular polysaccharide for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and nontypable Hemophilus influenzae, and protects cells from environmental stress. Vaccination targeting PNAG could contribute to immunity against serious and diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, and the conserved production of PNAG suggests that it is a critical factor in microbial biology.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Synthetic tactics of new class of 4-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbonitrile derivatives acting as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Thermal selective reactions were studied on oxothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide 3 with POCl3 and PCl5. At 25-50 degrees C, the C7-amide rearranges to nitrile furnished compound 4 in 85-90% yield, while at 80-110 degrees C furnished mixture of products 4 and 5 in 28-68% yields. The chloro displacement with amines in compound 5 yielded 4-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbonitrile derivatives 8(a-h) and 9(a-e). Antimicrobial activity of new compounds was studied against several bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus MTCC-96, Escherichia coli MTCC-443, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC-4 41, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC-442 and fungi Aspergillus niger MTCC-282, Aspergillus clavatus MTCC-1323, Candida albicans MTCC-227 using broth microdilution method. Compounds 4, 8b, 8d, 8e, 8h and 9a showed promising antibacterial activity compared to ampicillin and compounds 8b, 8h showed better antifungal activity compared to greseofulvin.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Comparison of three methods for the recovery of skin pathogens from impetigo swabs collected in a remote community of Northern Territory, Australia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common infection in children living in remote areas. Immediate plating of impetigo swabs is the gold standard for bacterial recovery but is rarely feasible in remote regions. Bacterial culture increases our understanding of antibiotic resistance and strain diversity, which guides treatment protocols and epidemiological monitoring. METHODS: We investigated three practical alternatives for recovering Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus from transported swabs: dry swabs transported at 4 degrees C with desiccant and plated within 48 h; swabs inoculated into skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol broth (STGGB), transported at 4 degrees C, stored at -70 degrees C and plated within 61 days; and ESwabs inoculated into Amies broth, transported at 4 degrees C and plated within 48 h. Detection of Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus from simultaneously collected swabs was compared for the dry vs STGGB (36 sores) and the STGGB vs Amies (39 sores) methods. Swabs were collected from 43 children (75 sores sampled) in a remote community of Northern Territory, Australia in November 2011. The children had impetigo and were participating in the Skin Sore Trial [Australian Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000858291]. RESULTS: Recovery of Strep. pyogenes for dry vs STGGB was 72% (26/36) and 92% (33/36) and for STGGB vs Amies was 92% (36/39) for both methods. Staphylococcus aureus recovery for dry vs STGGB was 69% (25/36) and 72% 26/36) and for STGGB vs Amies was 74% (29/39) and 85% (33/39). CONCLUSION: STGGB and Amies media provided higher recovery of Strep. pyogenes than dry swabs. These results and the opportunity to batch and store specimens for molecular studies support the use of STGGB transport media for future impetigo research.
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Development and application of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  - Infections with Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. It can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. Thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. The target genes used were KMT1 of P. multocida, the invasion protein gene of S. enterica, 16S rDNA of R. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of E. coli. The detection limit of the assay for all bacterial DNA was 10 pg. The mPCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. We applied mPCR to field samples, and the results were the same as the single PCR results. These results suggest that mPCR for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria was conducted. Sedimentation technique using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). Male medical ward (MMW) and male surgical general (MSG) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (OT) was almost free of microbial burden. The bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Candida albicans and Alternaria sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while Penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. From the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.
TI  - Milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid A, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative PCR test.
AB  - The associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time PCR test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (APP) and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity in milk in naturally occurring clinical mastitis were investigated. Milk APP concentrations and NAGase activity in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. The associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of APP and NAGase activity were estimated. Milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 Estonian dairy farms and analyzed by PCR to identify pathogens. Twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were PCR negative. Milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. In total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. A single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in 99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. To determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid A (MAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) and NAGase activity in the milk were analyzed. A significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. Milk amyloid A and Hp concentrations and NAGase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial DNA from Escherichia coli or Streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. Large quantities of bacterial DNA from Trueperella pyogenes or Streptococcus uberis in the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of Hp and high NAGase activity, but not with increased MAA concentrations. Milk samples containing Corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of MAA and Hp and lower NAGase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. It can be concluded that concentrations of APP and NAGase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial DNA in the milk samples.
TI  - Antibacterial performance of nanoscaled visible-light responsive platinum-containing titania photocatalyst in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional antibacterial photocatalysts are primarily induced by ultraviolet light to elicit antibacterial reactive oxygen species. New generation visible-light responsive photocatalysts were discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. Recently, we found that visible-light responsive platinum-containing titania (TiO2-Pt) exerted high performance antibacterial property against soil-borne pathogens even in soil highly contaminated water. However, its physical and photocatalytic properties, and the application in vivo have not been well-characterized. METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum and the removal rate of nitrogen oxides were therefore analyzed. The antibacterial performance under in vitro and in vivo conditions was evaluated. RESULTS: The apparent quantum efficiency for visible light illuminated TiO2-Pt is relatively higher than several other titania photocatalysts. The killing effect achieved approximately 2 log reductions of pathogenic bacteria in vitro. Illumination of injected TiO2-Pt successfully ameliorated the subcutaneous infection in mice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of in vivo antibacterial use of TiO2-Pt nanoparticles. When compared to nanoparticles of some other visible-light responsive photocatalysts, TiO2-Pt nanoparticles induced less adverse effects such as exacerbated platelet clearance and hepatic cytotoxicity in vivo. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that the TiO2-Pt may have potential application on the development of an antibacterial material in both in vitro and in vivo settings.
TI  - Microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of pediatric cervical lymphadenitis requiring surgical intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute cervical lymphadenitis is a common condition often times requiring antibiotic therapy and possible surgical drainage. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic and therapeutic management of children requiring surgical drainage for acute cervical lymphadenitis. METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study was performed at a Midwestern US tertiary-care children's hospital on all immunocompetent children who underwent an incision and drainage procedure of cervical lymphadenitis from January 1999 to July 2009. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients were identified. Males represented 51% and the median age was 28 months (IQR: 13-59). Lymphadenitis was unilateral in 243 (87.7%) cases and bilateral in 19 (6.9%). Median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR: 3-5). Aerobic, anaerobic, acid fast bacillus (AFB), and fungal cultures were obtained intraoperatively in 99%, 98%, 82%, and 78% of cases, respectively. However no fungal cultures were positive and only 1% of anaerobic and 2% of AFB cultures were positive. The most common bacterial etiology was Staphylococcus aureus (35.7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (18.8%). Of all cultures, 32% were negative. Overall, 22% were positive for methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 13.7% for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with 96% MSSA and 100% MRSA susceptible to clindamycin. Median duration of discharge antibiotics prescribed was 10 days (IQR: 7-11). Only 12 (4.5%) patients required a repeat incision and drainage within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: A single antibiotic that treats S. pyogenes and S. aureus should be the empiric antibiotic for cervical lymphadenitis requiring incision and drain. We recommend sending only aerobic cultures intraoperatively as a routine practice as other pathogens are rare.
TI  - Contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline HCL tested against Gram-positive pathogens: SENTRY Program results using CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint criteria.
AB  - Tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp. Also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and regulatory-approved documents. We have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline HCL and minocycline when tested against contemporary Gram-positive pathogens. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline HCL activity via reference methods (M07-A9) using a worldwide collection of S. aureus (SA; 4917 strains with 1955 MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 1899), S. pyogenes (GRA; 246), and S. agalactiae (GRB; 217). Regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline HCL of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for MRSA/SPN/GRB/GRA, respectively. Lower EUCAST susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/mL) for GRA to -8.9% (</=1 mug/mL) for MRSA (97.2% susceptible by CLSI; 88.3% by EUCAST). Use of tetracycline HCL-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (CLSI) to 98.4% to 99.6% (EUCAST) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the CLSI breakpoints (14.7%) compared to EUCAST criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for MRSA testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline HCL when testing SA (especially MRSA) and pathogenic streptococci. When testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. We conclude that EUCAST breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/mL) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Synthesis of pyrazole encompassing 2-pyridone derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  - A series of novel compounds 6-amino-1-((1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-yl)methyleneamino)-4-(aryl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihy dropyridine-3,5-dicarbonitriles (4a-t) were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral data. These compounds were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (Gram positive), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative) by serial broth dilution and cytotoxic activity (NIH 3T3 & HeLa) by MTT assay. The results indicated that compounds 4g, 4i, 4m, 4o, 4r and 4t exhibit potent antibacterial activity against bacterial strains at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
TI  - A peptide antagonist of CD28 signaling attenuates toxic shock and necrotizing soft-tissue infection induced by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) express superantigen (SAg) exotoxin proteins capable of inducing lethal shock. To induce toxicity, SAgs must bind not only to the major histocompatibility complex II molecule of antigen-presenting cells and the variable beta chain of the T-cell receptor but also to the dimer interface of the T-cell costimulatory receptor CD28. Here, we show that the CD28-mimetic peptide AB103 (originally designated "p2TA") protects mice from lethal challenge with streptococcal exotoxin A, as well as from lethal GAS bacterial infection in a murine model of necrotizing soft-tissue infection. Administration of a single dose of AB103 increased survival when given up to 5 hours after infection, reduced inflammatory cytokine expression and bacterial burden at the site of infection, and improved muscle inflammation in a dose-dependent manner, without compromising cellular and humoral immunity. Thus, AB103 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic in SAg-mediated necrotizing soft-tissue infection.
TI  - Bone and joint infections.
AB  - An acute osteoarticular infection in a child is most often hematogenous. The infection manifests as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Medical advice is usually sought within 2 to 6 days from the onset of symptoms. A child with an osteomyelitis in a lower extremity characteristically presents with limping with or without notable local tenderness, whereas acute septic arthritis is often readily visible because the joint is red, tender, and swollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment remain pivotal in avoiding complications in acute bacterial bone and joint infections.
TI  - Acute sinusitis in children.
AB  - Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the antibacterial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, GSK1322322.
AB  - GSK1322322 is a novel peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitor being developed for the intravenous and oral treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The activity of GSK1322322 was tested against a global collection of clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2,370), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 115), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 947), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 617), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 940), including strains resistant to one or more marketed antibiotics. GSK1322322 had an MIC(90) of 1 mug/ml against M. catarrhalis and 4 mug/ml against H. influenzae, with 88.8% of beta-lactamase-positive strains showing growth inhibition at that concentration. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited by </= 4 mug/ml of GSK1322322, with an MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml. Pre-existing resistance mechanisms did not affect its potency, as evidenced by the MIC(90) of 1 mug/ml for penicillin, levofloxacin, and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. GSK1322322 was very potent against S. pyogenes strains, with an MIC(90) of 0.5 mug/ml, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotype. This PDF inhibitor was also active against S. aureus strains regardless of their susceptibility to methicillin, macrolides, or levofloxacin, with an MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml in all cases. Time-kill studies showed that GSK1322322 had bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus, demonstrating a >/= 3-log(10) decrease in the number of CFU/ml at 4x MIC within 24 h in 29 of the 33 strains tested. Given the antibacterial potency demonstrated against this panel of organisms, GSK1322322 represents a valuable alternative therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oils from Magnolia grandiflora, Chrysactinia mexicana, and Schinus molle found in northeast Mexico.
AB  - The essential oils from Magnolia grandiflora and Chrysactinia mexicana leaves, and from Schinus molle leaves and fruit, were characterized by gas chromatography/flame-ionization detection and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Twenty-eight compounds from M. grandiflora leaves were identified (representing 93.6% of the total area of the gas chromatogram), with the major component being bornyl acetate (20.9%). Colorless and yellow oils were obtained from the C. mexicana leaves with 18 (86.7%) and 11 (100%) compounds identified, respectively. In both fractions, the principal component was sylvestrene (36.8% and 41.1%, respectively). The essential oils ofS. molle leaves and fruit were each separated into colorless and yellow fractions, in which 14 (98.2) and 20 (99.8%) compounds were identified. The main component was alpha-phellandrene in all fractions (between 32.8% and 45.0%). The M. grandiflora oil displayed antifungal activity against five dermatophyte strains. The oils from S. molle and M. grandiflora leaves had antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, which cause skin infections that potentially may lead to sepsis. However, the antioxidant activities of all oils were small (half maximal effective concentration values >250 microg/mL).
TI  - Rapid-antigen detection tests for group a streptococcal pharyngitis: revisiting false-positive results using polymerase chain reaction testing.
AB  - We investigated mechanisms of the false-positive test results on rapid-antigen detection test (RADT) for group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Most RADT false-positives (76%) were associated with polymerase chain reaction-positive GAS results, suggesting that RADT specificity could be considered close to 100%. Finding that 61% of GAS culture-negative but RADT-positive cases were positive on both GAS polymerase chain reaction and Staphylococcus aureus testing, we posit bacterial inhibition as causative.
TI  - IgG-binding bacterial proteins and pathogenesis.
AB  
TI  - Effects of different substituents on the crystal structures and antimicrobial activities of six Ag(I) quinoline compounds.
AB  - The syntheses and single crystal X-ray structures of [Ag(5-nitroquinoline)2]NO3 (1), [Ag(8-nitroquinoline)2]NO3.H2O (2), [Ag(6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline)(NO3)]n (3), [Ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)(NO3)]n (4), [Ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)2]NO3 (5), and [Ag(6-quinolinecarboxylic acid)2]NO3 (6) are described. As an alternative to solution chemistry, solid-state grinding could be used to prepare compounds 1 and 3, but the preparation of 4 and 5 in this way failed. The Ag(I) ions in the monomeric compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 are coordinated to two ligands via the nitrogen atoms of the quinoline rings, thereby forming a distorted linear coordination geometry with Ag-N bond distances of 2.142(2)-2.336(2) A and N-Ag-N bond angles of 163.62(13) degrees -172.25(13) degrees . The 1D coordination polymers 3 and 4 contain Ag(I) centers coordinating one ligand and two bridging nitrate groups, thereby forming a distorted trigonal planar coordination geometry with Ag-N bond distances of 2.2700(14) and 2.224(5) A, Ag-O bond distances of 2.261(4)-2.536(5) A, and N-Ag-O bond angles of 115.23(5) degrees -155.56(5) degrees . Hirshfeld surface analyses of compounds 1-6 are presented as d(norm) and curvedness maps. The d(norm) maps show different interaction sites around the Ag(I) ions, i.e., Ag...Ag interactions and possible O-H...O, C-H...O, C-H...N, and C-H...C hydrogen bonds. Curvedness maps are a good way of visualizing pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. The antimicrobial activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6 were screened against 15 different multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and compared to the antimicrobial activities of the clinically used silver sulfadiazine (SS). Compound 2 showed activity similar to SS against this set of test organisms, being active against all strains and having slightly better average silver efficiency than SS (5 vs 6 mug Ag/mL). Against the standard nonresistant bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Proteus mirabilis , and Streptococcus pyogenes , compound 1 performed better than silver nitrate, with an average MIC of 6 mug Ag/mL versus 18 mug Ag/mL for the reference AgNO3. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses of compounds 3 and 6 in DMSO/MeOH confirm the two-coordinated Ag(+) complexes in solution, and the results of the (1)H NMR titrations of DMSO solutions of 5-nitroquinoline and 8-nitroquinoline with AgNO3 in DMSO suggest that 5-nitroquinoline is more strongly coordinated to the silver ion.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Resistance of acellular dermal matrix materials to microbial penetration.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Acellular dermal matrices have many current and potential applications, but their long-term safety has not been extensively studied. In particular, limited information exists regarding such materials' resistance to infection. OBJECTIVE: To assess the resistance to microbial penetration of common acellular dermal matrix materials used in reconstruction after skin cancer excision, treatment of chronic ulcers and burns, breast reconstruction, hernia repairs, and other applications. DESIGN: Comparative in vitro study of 4 commercially available dermal substitutes for their ability to act as barriers to penetration by common skin pathogens. SETTING: University-based dermatology and plastic surgery departments and a hospital microbiology laboratory. MATERIALS: Four commercially available dermal substitutes, including AlloDerm (LifeCell), FlexHD (Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation), Strattice (LifeCell), and NeoForm (Mentor Corporation). INTERVENTION: We tested the 4 dermal matrix materials with the following 4 organisms commonly implicated in wound infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Candida albicans. Each material was inoculated with the same concentration of each pathogen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of bacterial colonies grown on blood agar plates. RESULTS: AlloDerm and rehydrated FlexHD were found to be the best barriers to penetration by P. aeruginosa. AlloDerm, FlexHD, and Strattice also prevented penetration by S. aureus and S. pyogenes; NeoForm was less effective in withstanding these organisms. The results of this study were inconclusive with regard to C. albicans penetration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Three of the 4 commonly used acellular dermal matrix materials are resistant to in vitro penetration by S. aureus and S. pyogenes and partially resistant to P. aeruginosa. Resistance to fungal pathogens is uncertain. Antimicrobial differences across matrix materials may influence their selection for particular uses, such as treatment of refractory leg ulcers or reconstruction after skin cancer excision.
TI  - New alkaloid from Streptomyces koyangensis residing in Odontotermes formosanus.
AB  - A new alkaloid was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of a termite-associated Streptomyces koyangensis BY-4. The structure of 1 was elucidated by using MS, NMR, electronic circular dichroism data, and computational approaches. Compound 1 showed weak antimicrobial activities against a panel of test microbes.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the volatile fractions from leaves and flowers of the wild Iraqi Kurdish plant Prangos peucedanifolia FENZL.
AB  - The volatile fractions isolated from Prangos peucedanifolia FENZL leaves and flowers were investigated for their phytochemical composition and biological properties. Flower and leaf hydrodistillation afforded 3.14 and 0.49 g of yellowish oils in 1.25 and 0.41% yields, respectively, from dry vegetable materials. According to the GC-FID and GC/MS analyses, 36 (99.35% of the total oil composition) and 26 compounds (89.12%) were identified in the two oils, respectively. The major constituents in the flower volatile fraction were beta-pinene (35.58%), alpha-pinene (22.13%), and beta-phellandrene (12.54%), while m-cresol (50.38%) was the main constituent of the leaf volatile fraction. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against several bacterial and fungal strains, on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by the micro- and macrodilution methods. The two volatile fractions showed moderate antifungal and antibacterial activities, especially against Trichophyton rubrum (MIC of 2x10(3) mug/ml), Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC</=1.9x10(3) mug/ml for all).
TI  - Biological approach to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles using Aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. A novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) was reported. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, XRD, AFM and FESEM with EDX. FTIR showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group OH stretching amine NH stretch in the formation of TiO2 NPs. The XRD spectrum confirmed that the synthesized TiO2 NPs were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. The crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. The morphological characterization was analyzed by FESEM and the analysis showed the NPs smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. GC-MS analysis showed the main compounds found in A. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-L-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-L-proline (74.41%) and L-Leucyl-D-leucine (15.74%). The potential glycyl-L-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. A possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of TiO2 NPs has been proposed. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized TiO2 NPs was assessed by well diffusion method toward A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against S. aureus (33 mm) and S. pyogenes (31 mm).
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Burden of paediatric pyoderma and scabies in North West Queensland.
AB  - AIM: The study aims to assess the health burden of children admitted with 'scabies' to Mt Isa Hospital, the referral centre for North West Queensland, from 2006 to 2010. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart audit of admissions of children with 'scabies' including age, sex, date, residence, Indigenous status, result of skin swabs and length of stay, and the number of admissions with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulo-nephritis (APSGN) in that period. Financial burden was estimated from daily bed costs and transportation. RESULTS: There were 113 admissions with mean age of 23/12: 11% were <2/12 and mean stay was 4.5 days. 19 were admitted twice, 5 thrice and 2 four times. 7 individuals accounted for 25% of admissions. 'Scabies' accounted for 10.1% of medical admissions <5 years of age. Admissions increased from 10 in 2005 to 39 in 2010. The minimum cost per admission was $9584.07. Seventy-one per cent of swabs grew Group A streptococcus, all sensitive to penicillin. Sixty-three per cent of these were accompanied by Staphylococcus aureus, which was the sole organism in 18%. Sixty-four per cent of S. aureus were methicillin resistant. There were 29 admissions for ARF and 23 with APSGN. All children with 'scabies' and ARF and all but three with APSGN were Indigenous. CONCLUSION: Pyoderma and scabies are major health burdens in North West Queensland, requiring organised community-based prevention. The number of repeat admissions emphasises the futility of individual treatment.
TI  - Emergence of methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus among patients associated with group A Streptococcal pharyngitis infection in southern India.
AB  - Beyond Staphylococcus aureus being an etiological agent for several serious clinical complications, the foot prints of S. aureus in pharyngitis infection has also been recently recognized. With due response to the fact, a prospective study was conducted between 2009 and 2010 to describe the molecular epidemiology of S. aureus in throat swabs of pharyngitis patients. A total of 63 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 102 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were recovered from 265 throat swabs, representing a community-acquired outpatient population from Tamil Nadu, India. Molecular characterization of MRSA was done by two conventional multiplex PCR assays including Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), mecA and nuc genes, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. Among 165 S. aureus isolates, methicillin resistance was observed in 38.2% (n=63), in which 69.8% (n=44/63) of the MRSA along with 55.9% (n=57/102) of MSSA harbored PVL toxin genes. SCCmec typing showed 50.8% of isolates as SCCmec V (n=32), 44.4% as SCCmec III (n=28), and 1.6% as SCCmec types I, II and IVa (n=1). Multilocus sequence typing performed for 26 selected MRSA isolates resulted in 12 different sequence types (ST), including a novel ST2129/SCCmec III, PVL-positive. Ten MRSA isolates were categorized as ST772 (38.5%)/SCCmec V, PVL-positive, and three isolates as ST368 (11.5%)/SCCmec III, PVL-negative. Though the prominent clones of ST772/SCCmec V were multidrug-susceptible worldwide, they were highly multidrug-resistant in the current study, including four clones intermediate to vancomycin. Totally, 10 (15.9%) out of 63 MRSA isolates were documented as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Collectively, the present study for the first time portrayed the high prevalence of active MRSA pharyngitis infection and also emphasizes an alarming need for discrimination of pharyngeal-asymptomatic carriers of S. aureus from those with an active S. aureus pharyngitis infection.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) extracts and its main constituents.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) stem bark is used in Cameroon by Baka Pygmies for the treatment of respiratory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of constituents from the bark extracts through bioassay-guided fractionation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of extracts, fractions and pure compounds was assessed through the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. DPPH, ABTS and ORAC assays were used for determining the antioxidant properties. The activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) by the macrodilution method. RESULTS: The water extract showed antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 300 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 300 mug/ml). The dichloromethane extract efficiently inhibited NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and NO production and exhibited significant antioxidant activity in the ORAC assay. An interesting activity was also found against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 200 mug/ml), S. aureus (MIC: 400 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 200 mug/ml). The phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract afforded plumbagin, canaliculatin, ismailin, betulinic acid and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-coumarin as the main constituents. Plumbagin and ismailin were found to be responsible for the main biological activities observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results may provide a rational support for the traditional use of Diospyros bipindensis stem bark in the treatment of respiratory disorders, since the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds isolated from the dichloromethane extract were also present in the traditional water extract.
TI  - Bacterial coinfection in influenza: a grand rounds review.
AB  - Bacterial coinfection complicated nearly all influenza deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic and up to 34% of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infections managed in intensive care units worldwide. More than 65,000 deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia occur annually in the United States. Data from 683 critically ill patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection admitted to 35 intensive care units in the United States reveal that bacterial coinfection commonly occurs within the first 6 days of influenza infection, presents similarly to influenza infection occurring alone, and is associated with an increased risk of death. Pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, are most commonly isolated. Complex viral, bacterial, and host factors contribute to the pathogenesis of coinfection. Reductions in morbidity and mortality are dependent on prevention with available vaccines as well as early diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - The mutated staphylococcal H35A alpha-toxin inhibits adhesion and invasion of Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci.
AB  - In previous studies we demonstrated that the staphylococcal alpha-toxin inhibits  adhesion and invasion of S. aureus by epithelial cells through binding to alpha5beta1 integrin, a receptor of fibronectin. Moreover, we revealed that a H35A mutation abolishes the cytotoxicity of alpha-toxin completely. These findings led us to hypothesize that the H35A mutated alpha-toxin may be explored as a potential inhibitor for bacterial adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells. In this study, we examined the impact of the H35A alpha-toxin on staphylococcal capacity of adhering to and invading into epithelial cells and found that the addition of H35A alpha-toxin in the culture medium dramatically inhibited S. aureus' ability to adhere to and internalize into epithelial cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that both the staphylococcal alpha-toxin and H35A mutated alpha-toxin are capable of retarding the adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells by Streptococcus pyogenes. These findings suggest that the H35A toxoid has the potential to be utilized as an inhibitor of S. aureus and S. pyogenes ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells.
TI  - Novel topoisomerase inhibitors: microbiological characterisation and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines.
AB  - Pyrimidine compounds were identified as inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase IV through high-throughput screening. This study was designed to exemplify the in vitro activity of the pyrimidines against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, to reveal the mode of action of these compounds and to demonstrate their in vivo efficacy. Frequencies of resistance to pyrimidines among Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were <10(-10) at four times their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These compounds exhibited a dual mode of action through inhibition of the ParE subunit of DNA topoisomerase IV as well as the GyrB subunit of DNA gyrase, a homologue of DNA topoisomerase IV. Pyrimidines were shown to have MIC(90) values (MIC that inhibited 90% of the strains tested) of </=2 mg/L against Gram-positive pathogens, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, quinolone- and meticillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, and MIC(90) values of 2- to >16 mg/L and </=0.5 mg/L against the Gram-negative pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. The pyrimidines were bactericidal and exhibited a ca. 1000-fold reduction of the bacterial counts at 300 mg/kg in a S. pneumoniae lung infection model. The microbiological properties and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines underscore their potential as candidates for the treatment of soft-tissue infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - In silico modeling of the type 2 IDI enzymes of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus for virtual screening of potential inhibitors of this therapeutic target.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus genera which rely on the Mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. The pathogens contain type 2 IDI in contrast to human that contains type 1 IDI. Therefore, the type 2 IDI may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. In the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from CoCoCo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 IDIs. To this end, the structures of the type 2 IDIs of Bacillus licheniformis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based prediction. The predicted models were evaluated based on Q-mean and Prosa score. Molegro Virtual Docker with MolDock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. Also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the Sulfolobus shibatae and Thermus thermophilus type 2 IDIs as well as the Escherichia coli type 1 IDI. Finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 IDI. Interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial IDIs especially the type 2 IDIs of pathogens while it is not inhibiting the human IDI.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different Finnish monofloral honeys against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and phenolic compounds of five Finnish honey products  against important human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were analyzed. Microbroth dilution method and HPLC-DAD were used in antimicrobial testing and phenolic compound determination, respectively. Significant antimicrobial activity (p < 0.01) against all the tested pathogens was found from willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium), heather (Calluna vulgaris), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) honeys. This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of Finnish monofloral honeys against streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria. To our knowledge this is also the first report on the antimicrobial effect of honey against S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Familial Oral Microbial Imbalance and Dental Caries Occurrence in Their Children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop a familial liability index for oral microbial status that reflects an imbalance of oral domains based on the presence of risk indicators in saliva, inter-proximal plaque, tongue, and throat. METHODS: Fifty-six mother-child pairs from Webster and Nicholas counties, West Virginia, USA, participated in this study. Saliva samples were assayed for mutans streptococci (MS), interproximal plaque samples for the BANA Test (BT) species, tongue swabs for BT, and throat swabs for any of the sentinel organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and yeasts). The corresponding thresholds for a (+) risk indicator were, respectively, >/=105 CFU of MS salivary levels, one or more BT-(+) plaques (>105 CFU/mg of plaque of at least one of BT-(+) species), weak-(+) BT for a tongue swab (>104-<105), and >104 CFU/swab for any of the sentinel markers. RESULTS: The mean age of mothers and children was 41.6 and 14.6 years. Ninety-one % of both mothers and children had at least one (+) risk indicator. Overall, 76% of mother child-pairs had at least one (+) concordant oral microbial risk indicator. Accordingly, the relative risk (RR) of children having concordant results with their mothers was increased 1.36 (BT-plaque), 1.37 (BT-tongue), 0.94 (sentinel organisms) and 1.13 (MS) times. Principal component analysis revealed distinct sets of oral microbial risk indicators in mothers and children that correlated with dental caries prevalence rates in children. CONCLUSIONS: Mother-child pairs shared similarities of oral microbial risk indicators that allow for the development of a liability index that can elucidate caries in the children.
TI  - Risk factors, microbiological findings and outcomes of necrotizing fasciitis in New Zealand: a retrospective chart review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality from necrotizing fasciitis (NF) are increasing in New Zealand (NZ). Triggered by a media report that traditional Samoan tattooing was causing NF, we conducted a chart review to investigate the role of this and other predisposing and precipitating factors and to document NF microbiology, complications and interventions in NZ. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 299 hospital charts of patients discharged with NF diagnosis codes in eight hospitals in NZ between 2000 and 2006. We documented and compared by ethnicity the prevalence of predisposing and precipitating conditions, bacteria isolated, complications and interventions used. RESULTS: Out of 299 charts, 247 fulfilled the case definition. NF was most common in elderly males. Diabetes was the most frequent co-morbid condition, followed by obesity. Nearly a quarter of patients were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Traditional Samoan tattooing was an uncommon cause. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were the two commonly isolated bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was implicated in a relatively small number of cases. Shock, renal failure, coagulation abnormality and multi-organ dysfunction were common complications. More than 90% of patients underwent surgical debridement, 56% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and slightly less than half of all patients had blood product transfusion. One in six NF cases had amputations and 23.5% died. CONCLUSION: This chart review found that the highest proportion of NF cases was elderly males with co-morbidities, particularly diabetes and obesity. Tattooing was an uncommon precipitating event. The role of NSAID needs further exploration. NF is a serious disease with severe complications, high case fatality and considerable use of health care resources.
TI  - Mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using PathoProof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a Northern German field study.
AB  - In the following field study, the commercial PathoProof Mastitis PCR Assay, a real-time PCR for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. For this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, Germany, were collected between July 2010 and February 2011 and subjected to PCR and bacterial culture. The frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with PCR compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). This was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the PCR compared with bacterial culture. Using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. For Enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. When the PCR results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen DNA was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. With both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (PCR: Corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, followed by Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus with PCR, and then with both methods, Streptococcus uberis. The staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the S. aureus and in 37.0% of the CNS identifications.
TI  - Pitfalls in diagnosing septic arthritis in Hong Kong children: ten years' experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the initial presentation of septic arthritis in Hong Kong children with respect to clinical and laboratory findings that can aid making a prompt diagnosis. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Five public hospitals in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Data concerning paediatric patients with septic arthritis were collected from January 2001 to December 2010. Patients with postoperative infections and those without enough retrievable information were excluded. RESULTS: Of 31 patients analysed, on admission only 52% had had a fever of <38.5 degrees C and 71% had raised white blood cell count of <12 x 10(9) /L. In 74% of these patients, Gram stains of blood culture samples yielded no positive findings. The leading causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus (42%), followed by group A Streptococcus (23%). When group A Streptococcus was responsible, five out of seven patients had a complicated clinical course (repeated surgeries, Streptococcus-related organ failure, and chronic joint stiffness). Moreover, in 19% of instances, the empirical antibiotic therapy prescribed on admission did not provide a broad enough spectrum of cover. CONCLUSION: Signs of sepsis such as high fever, raised white blood cell count, and positive Gram smear from blood cultures were only present in around half of these patients with septic arthritis. Furthermore, group A Streptococcus tended to produce many complications. Regrettably, about a quarter of the empirical antibiotic regimens started by frontline staff were deemed not have a broad enough spectrum of cover. Improvement in the initial detection and management of septic arthritis patients is warranted.
TI  - A retrospective evaluation of microbiology of acute otitis media complicated by spontaneous otorrhea in children living in Milan, Italy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) with otorrhea due to spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation (STMP) in children living in Milan, Italy. METHODS: We evaluated middle ear fluid (MEF) specimens taken from children affected by AOM associated with STMP and otorrhea between January 2001 and December 2011. The fluid was collected by means of direct swab sampling, sent for culture, and processed within 4 h. RESULTS: A total of 705 specimens were obtained from 458 children (233 boys; mean age +/- SD 28.3 +/- 19.9 months), and were positive for bacteria in 487 cases (69.1 %). The most frequently cultured infectious agent in single-pathogen cultures was Haemophilus. influenzae (51.0 %), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4 %), Streptococcus pyogenes (17.4 %), and Staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %). After adjusting for the sub-period of data collection, age, gender, and previous full heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) schedule, it was found that the prevalence of H. influenzae slightly increased in 2008-2010, and the prevalence of S. pneumoniae significantly decreased over time (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: AOM with STMP is a particular form of AOM in which S. pyogenes plays a significant causative role although, as in uncomplicated cases, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae retain their etiological importance. The frequency of the detection of S. aureus in MEF deserves further study because this pathogen can give rise to severe clinical problems. Finally, although the use of PCV-7 was relatively efficacious, the benefit of pneumococcal vaccination would be increased by vaccines including a larger number of serotypes.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - [Two bacteria and common skin infections].
AB  - Common bacterial skin infections represent frequent disorders encountered in general practice and in dermatology as well. They encompass a series of infections affecting the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis and subcutaneous tissues. The two main bacteria involved in these processes are Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The resulting infections show various clinical presentations. Their management must be adapted to their gravity and to the putative or proven nature of the causal microorganism. Searching for any skin ingress possibility and any favouring factor is always of importance in order to stimulate healing and avoid recurrences. Of note, skin possibly allows the ingress way for a secondary septicemic dissemination. Conversely, skin is possibly involved in tissue localisation of septicemia.
TI  - [Macrophage apoptosis as a mechanism of pathogenic effect of diphtheria infectious agent].
AB  - AIM: Study of the apoptogenic effect of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxigenic strains on mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation ofapoptosis induced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes strains was performed by characteristic morphological changes in macrophages in smears stained by azure eosin by Romanovsky-Giemsa. RESULTS: Apoptogenic activity of diphtheria infectious agent was established to be determined by diphtheria exotoxin at early (after 1 hour) and surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes at later (3 hours) stages of effect. CONCLUSION: The ability of diphtheria infectious agent to cause macrophage apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of realization of its pathogenic properties determined by the effect of diphtheria exotoxin, as well as its surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes. The increase of apoptogenic activity of toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae in association with S. pyogenes may be a pathogenetic base of formation of prolonged forms of bacteria carriage against the background of chronic ENT pathology.
TI  - [Clinical course of acute respiratory infection and the state of microbiocenosis  of upper respiratory tract in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Evaluate clinical features of the course of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and the state of microbiocenosis of nasopharynx of pregnant women at gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the stage of outpatient therapy of ARI 49 pregnant women at the gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks were examined: group 1--27 individuals consulting at day 1 and receiving Viferon (gel) intranasally for 10 days, group 2--22 individuals consulting at day 2 - 3 and receiving Viferon (gel and suppositorium). Respiratory viral infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Bacteriologic study of discharge from the middle section of the pharynx was performed by the standard technique. RESULTS: ARI in group 1 of pregnant women were regarded as mild severity and persisted for an average of 3 days. In group 2 in 13 (59%) of patients ARI of moderate severity was noted and the recovery occurred at day 6. Pyo-inflammatory diseases of ENT organs appeared in 10 (45.4%) of patients. Respiratory infections were determined in 16 (32.7%) of them: coronaviruses--in 5 (10.2%), rhinoviruses--in 3 (6.2%), respiratory syncytial viruses--in 6 (12.3%), parainfluenza (type 2) and influenza A viruses--1 (2%) both, without significant differences between the observed groups. Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes with the predominance of the latter in 36.7% and 60% of cases, respectively, in pregnant women of the group 2 (p < 0.01), were detected in the microflora of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Viferon preparation therapy prescribed at day 1 of outpatient visit of pregnant women may promote mild course o fARI and prophylaxis of complications of upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Spatial positioning of cell wall-anchored virulence factors in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many virulence factors of Gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the peptidoglycan by a sorting signal. While surface display mechanisms are well characterized, less is known about the spatial and temporal organization of these proteins in the bacterial envelope. This review summarizes recent studies on the rod-shaped Listeria monocytogenes, ovococcal Streptococcus pyogenes and spherical Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that provide insights into the compartmentalization of the surface and distribution of peptidoglycan-anchored proteins in space and time. We discuss models that support mechanistic bases for localization of proteins at the poles, septum or lateral sites. The results indicate that deployment of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria is a dynamic process tightly connected to secretion, cell morphogenesis, cell division rate and gene expression levels.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Microbial diversity of bovine mastitic milk as described by pyrosequencing of metagenomic 16s rDNA.
AB  - Dairy cow mastitis is an important disease in the dairy industry. Different microbial species have been identified as causative agents in mastitis, and are traditionally diagnosed by bacterial culture. The objective of this study was to use metagenomic pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial DNA diversity in milk samples of mastitic and healthy dairy cows and compare the results with those obtained by classical bacterial culture. One hundred and thirty-six milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of mastitis and used for microbiological culture. Additionally, 20 milk samples were collected from healthy quarters. Bacterial DNA was isolated from the same milk samples and the 16S rRNA genes were individually amplified and pyrosequenced. Discriminant analysis showed that the groups of samples that were most clearly different from the rest and thus easily discriminated were the normal milk samples from healthy cows and those characterised by culture as Trueperella pyogenes and Streptococcus spp. The mastitis pathogens identified by culture were generally among the most frequent organisms detected by pyrosequencing, and in some cases (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus uberis mastitis) the single most prevalent microorganism. Trueperella pyogenes sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as Trueperella pyogenes by culture, Streptococcus dysgalactiae sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as Streptococcus dysgalactiae by culture, and Staphyloccocus aureus sequences were the third most prevalent in mastitis cases diagnosed as Staphylococcus aureus by culture. In samples that were aerobic culture negative, pyrosequencing identified DNA of bacteria that are known to cause mastitis, DNA of bacteria that are known pathogens but have so far not been associated with mastitis, and DNA of bacteria that are currently not known to be pathogens. A possible role of anaerobic pathogens in bovine mastitis is also suggested.
TI  - High prevalence of Non-typhoid salmonella bacteraemia among febrile HIV adult patients admitted at a tertiary Hospital, North-Western Tanzania.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial blood stream infections constitute a significant public-health problem and it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV infected patients. Little is known in developing countries regarding salmonella bacteraemia among HIV patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial pathogens causing blood stream infection among febrile adults attending in a tertiary hospital North-Western, Tanzania. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study involving 346 consecutive, febrile adult patients admitted at Bugando Medical Centre was conducted. Demographic and other data were collected using standardized questionnaires. Blood culture was done followed by susceptibility testing using disc diffusion method. HIV testing was also performed as per Tanzania national algorithm and total white blood cell counts and CD4+ counts determined. RESULTS: Of 346 febrile adult patients 33 (9.5%) had blood stream infections. The common isolates were Salmonella spp 13(39.4%), Escherichia coli 8 (24.2%), Streptococcus pneumonia 5(15.2%), Staphylococcus aureus 4(12.1%), Citrobacter spp 1(3%), Streptococcus pyogenes 1(3%) and Klebsiella pneumonia 1(3%). A total of 156 (45.1%) patients were HIV infected; of whom 12/156 (7.6%) were infected by non-typhoid Salmonella spp compared to 1/190 (0.5%) of non-HIV infected patients (RRR 11.2, p=0.029) infected with Salmonella typhi. HIV infected patients with bacteraemia had significantly lower CD4+ count than those without bacteraemia (median 28 vs. 88 cells/ml, p=0.01). Patients with salmonella bacteraemia had significantly lower median of WBC than those with non-salmonella as well as those without bacteraemia (median, 3.6 vs. 17.5 vs. 9.8x109, p=0.0001). All Salmonella spp were sensitive to ceftriaxone and imipenem, while being 84%, 69.2%, 38% and 8% resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, sulphamethaxazole/trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin respectively. Predictors of mortality were HIV infection (OR 2.3, p=0.006), Glasgow coma score of less than 15 (OR 3.4, p=0.0001) and night sweats (OR 2.4, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: Non-typhoid Salmonella spp that are highly resistant to common antibiotics are predominant cause of bacterial blood stream infection among HIV patients attending Bugando Medical Centre. Continuous surveillance and intervention strategies should be put in place to monitor and manage cases of bloodstream infections in HIV-positive patients in Mwanza, Tanzania.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of some new quinoline based derivatives endowed with broad spectrum antimicrobial potency.
AB  - The synthesis of a novel series of 2-(5-(2-chloro-6-fluoroquinolin-3-yl)-3-(aryl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazo l-4(5H)-ones (4a-l) and N-(4-(2-chloro-6-fluoroquinolin-3-yl)-6-(aryl)pyrimidin-2-yl)-2-morpholinoacetami des (7a-l) are described in the present paper. The chemical structures of compounds have been elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral data. Antimicrobial activity was measured against Escherichia coli (MTCC 443), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 1688), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 96), Streptococcus pyogenes (MTCC 442), Candida albicans (MTCC 227), Aspergillus niger (MTCC 282) and Aspergillus clavatus (MTCC 1323) by serial broth dilution. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity showed that several compounds exhibited greater activity than reference drugs and thus could be promising new lead molecules.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of ranalexin, a bioactive antimicrobial peptide  from Rana catesbeiana in Escherichia coli and assessments of its biological activities.
AB  - The coding sequence, which corresponds to the mature antimicrobial peptide ranalexin from the frog Rana catesbeiana, was chemically synthesized with preferred codons for expression in Escherichia coli. It was cloned into the vector pET32c (+) to express a thioredoxin-ranalexin fusion protein which was produced in soluble form in E. coli BL21 (DE3) induced under optimized conditions. After two purification steps through affinity chromatography, about 1 mg of the recombinant ranalexin was obtained from 1 L of culture. Mass spectrometrical analysis of the purified recombinant ranalexin demonstrated its identity with ranalexin. The purified recombinant ranalexin is biologically active. It showed antibacterial activities similar to those of the native peptide against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, and multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration values between 8 and 128 mug/ml. The recombinant ranalexin is also cytotoxic in HeLa and COS7 human cancer cells (IC50 = 13-15 mug/ml).

TI  - Antifungal activity and composition of essential oils of Conyza canadensis herbs  and roots.
AB  - Essential oils from herbs and roots of Conyza canadensis (horseweed), collected in Hungary, were obtained by hydrodistillation. The chemical compositions of the oils were analysed by combination of GC and GC/MS. The major constituent of the oil obtained from the aerial parts of horseweed was limonene (78%), while the main component of root oil was 2Z,8Z-matricaria ester. The antimicrobial activities of the oils were tested on Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, reference fungal strains, and fungal strains isolated from patients (Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichophyton, Rhodotorula, and Aspergillus) by agar disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. None of the oils showed any activity against the tested bacterial strains, but exhibited moderate-to-strong activity against all fungi with the only exception of A. fumigatus. The highest zone of inhibition was observed in case of Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton interdigitalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of Cassia fistula Linn. fruit pulp extracts.
AB  - Aim of the study is to assess the antimicrobial activity Cassia fistula fruit pulp extracts on some bacterial and fungal strains. Hydro alcohol and chloroform extracts of Cassia fistula fruit pulp were evaluated for the potential antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity was determined in both the extracts using the agar disc diffusion method. Extracts were effective on tested microorganisms. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of solvent extracts (5, 25, 50, 100, 250 mug/mL) of C. fistula were tested against two gram positive, two gram negative human pathogenic bacteria and three fungi, respectively. Crude extracts of C. fistula exhibited moderate to strong activity against most of the bacteria tested. The tested bacterial strains were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungal strains were Aspergillus. niger, Aspergillus. clavatus, Candida albicans. The antibacterial potential of the extracts were found to be dose dependent. The antibacterial activities of the C. fistula were due to the presence of various secondary metabolites. Hence, these plants can be used to discover bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals research activities.
TI  - Bacterial skin colonization and infections in patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects a large number of children and adults. The disease results from an interaction between genetic predisposition, host environment, skin barrier defects, and immunological factors. A major aggravating factor associated with Atopic Dermatitis is the presence of microorganisms on the patient's skin surface. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, for instance, can exacerbate chronic skin inflammation. As a result, antimicrobials have often been prescribed to control the acute phase of the disease. However, increased bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has made it difficult for dermatologists to prescribe appropriate medication. In the presence of disseminated dermatitis with secondary infection, systemic antibiotics need to be prescribed; however, treatment should be individualized, in an attempt to find the most effective antibiotic with fewer side effects. Also, the medication should be used for as short as possible in order to minimize bacterial resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various honey types of Algeria against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of honey from different  geographical location on Gram negative organisms. METHODS: Different concentrations (Undiluted honey, 10 %, 30%, 50% and 70% wt/vol) of honey were studied in vitro using Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), briefly, two-fold dilutions of honey solutions were tested to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each type of microorganism, followed by more assays within a narrower dilution range to obtain more precise MIC values. MICs were determined by both visual inspection and spectrophotometric assay at 620 nm. These honey samples were compared with standard antibiotics like ampicillin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, gentamycin, tobramycin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The diameter of zone of the inhibition (ZDI) of honey has various concentrations tested for the isolates ranged 0-46 mm for S. aureus, 0-44 mm for S. pyogenes. While the MIC (%) ranged 12%-95%, 25%-73% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Algeria honey, in-vitro, possess antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activity of clofoctol.
AB  - The aim of the study was to examine the In vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens to clofoctol compared with amoxicillin and erythromycin, and to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of clofoctol using a murine pneumonia infection model. Strains clinically isolated from patients between 2005 and 2009 were used to examine susceptibility: penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. The In vitro activity of clofoctol against clinical isolates has essentially remained unchanged over recent years. The MIC(5)(0) and MIC(9)(0) of clofoctol against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae are lower than that of amoxicillin and erythromycin. The area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) ratio is the PK/PD parameter that best correlates with in vivo clofoctol efficacy; the value of AUC/MIC required to achieve the maximum effect in this study was 75.5.
TI  - Unusual "flesh-eating" strains of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis (type II) is typically caused by group A streptococcus alone or in combination with Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli has been isolated from polymicrobial or Fournier's gangrene but has rarely been reported in monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of seven cases of monomicrobial E. coli necrotizing fasciitis and/or severe soft tissue infection diagnosed at a single institution during an 18-month period. Four isolates from three patients and two isolates from two patients with type I polymicrobial severe soft tissue infection (controls) were assayed by the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis for fingerprinting and PCR amplification of primers in order to detect cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 and 2 (cnf1 and cnf2) genes. All patients had some type of immune suppression. The limb was the most commonly involved organ. In all cases, E. coli was isolated as a monomicrobial pathogen from blood, fascia, or both. All patients died during hospitalization, three within the first 48 h. The RAPD amplification assay showed a high degree of genetic diversity among the "flesh-eating" strains and controls. The cnf1 toxin gene was identified in two out of three cases, but not in the controls. cnf2 was not detected in any of the patients. E. coli may be responsible for life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis. Further research is needed to reveal relevant risk factors, reservoirs, and modes of transmission of cnf1 E. coli.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of the essential oils from Duguetia lanceolata St. Hil. barks.
AB  - Essential oils of Duguetia lanceolata barks, obtained at 2 (T2) and 4 h (T4), were identified by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. beta-elemene (12.7 and 14.9%), caryophyllene oxide (12.4 and 10.7%) and beta-selinene (8.4 and 10.4%) were the most abundant components in T2 and T4, respectively. The essential oils inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The essential oils were cytotoxic against brine shrimp. The extraction time influenced the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils obtained from the barks of D. lanceolata.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand.
AB  - The vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. In this study, vegetables and fruits native to the Northeast region of Thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. For vegetables, the extracts of Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and Sauropus androgynus (Linn.) Merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by DPPH scavenging (IC5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively) and FRAP antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and 74.00+/-0.04 mmol FeSO4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of vegetable). For fruits, the extracts derived from Terminalia chebula Retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of DPPH scavenging (IC50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively), FRAP antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol FeSO4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). The antibacterial assays showed that Moringa oleifera Lam., Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr., Terminalia chebula Retz. and Phyllanthus emblica Linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Propionibacterium acnes. The results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to Thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.
TI  - Changing microbiology of pediatric neck abscesses in Iowa 2000-2010.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To examine the changing microbiology of pediatric neck abscesses over a 10-year period with particular interest in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and their associated antibacterial-resistance patterns, including resistance to clindamycin, a frequently used antibiotic for Staphylococcus aureus. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review at a tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two consecutive pediatric patients managed between January 2000 and June 2010 with incision and drainage of a proven neck abscess. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients with 76 abscesses were identified. A microorganism was found in 65 (85%) of the 76 abscesses. Forty-three percent grew Staphylococcus aureus (SA), 12% were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), and 31% were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). There was a significant increase in the incidence of MRSA infections during the study period, with only one case of MRSA diagnosed in the first half of the study (from 2000-2004) compared with seven in the second half (from 2005-2010) (P = 0.023). The second most common bacterial etiology or isolate was Streptococcus pyogenes in 27%, while the remaining 30% grew mixed oral flora and other microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a statistically significant rise in the proportion of MRSA neck infections in pediatric patients in Iowa. Resistance to clindamycin was highest among MSSA isolates. Clindamycin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are established pathogens in neck infections. In communities with similar microbiology patterns, empiric treatment with combination therapy of a beta lactam and vancomycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be initiated until culture results are available.
TI  - The effect of environmental conditions on expression of Bacteroides fragilis and  Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron C10 protease genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. However, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. To further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in B. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the C10 cysteine protease SpeB, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: We identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to C10 protease genes we recently identified in B. fragilis. Similar to C10 proteases found in B. fragilis, three of the B. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to Staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with Staphopains in Staphylococcus aureus. The expression of genes for these C10 proteases in both B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Genes encoding C10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. The Bacteroides C10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Cellulitis--epidemiological and clinical characteristics.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cellulitis is acute skin infection and/or infection of subcutaneous tissue, mostly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical preview is usually obvious and enough for diagnosis. Tretment is antimicrobial therapy. In recurrent cases a prophylaxis is very often needed. OBJECTIVES: Analysis some of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cellulitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical documentation of patients with clinical preview of cellulitis who were hospitalized in Clinic for infective diseases of Clinical Center of University of Sarajevo in last three years. RESULTS: In period of three years 123 patients were hospitalized with clinical preview of cellulitis in the broadest sense of the word. In 123 of cellulitises, 35/123 (28.45%) were erisipelases-superficial type and 88/123 (71,55%) were deep cellulitises. Men were more affected 56,09%, average of age was 50.22 years. Before hospitalization patients had ambulance treatment in average of 5.12 days, and hospitalization was long in average of 13.33 days. Risk factors wich contributes to the disease were found in 71.54% of cases. Due to localisation, skin disorders on lower limb were the most frequent 71.56%, cellulitis of upper limb were found in 12.19%, head and/or neck in 13.08%, trunk in 3.25%. Repetition of disease were found in 4.8% in patients wtih risk factors. Bacteremic isolats were confirmed in 27.64% of cases. In all patients empirical antibiotic treatment were started, in the 62.60% the first choice of medicine was antibiotic from the group of lincosamides. CONCLUSION: Cellulitis is very serious disease that can be prevented.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Antibacterial spirobisnaphthalenes from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium.
AB  - Urnucratins A-C (1-3), which possess an unusual bisnaphthospiroether skeleton with one oxygen bridge and one C-C bridge and represent a new subclass of bisnaphthalenes, were isolated from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were determined by means of HRMS, NMR, and quantum chemical CD calculations. Urnucratin A (1) was found to be active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pyogenes with MIC values of 2, 1, and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Evolutionary paths of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) harbors several superantigens (SAgs) in  the prophage region of its genome, although speG and smez are not located in this region. The diversity of SAgs is thought to arise during horizontal transfer, but their evolutionary pathways have not yet been determined. We recently completed sequencing the entire genome of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE), the closest relative of GAS. Although speG is the only SAg gene of SDSE, speG was present in only 50% of clinical SDSE strains and smez in none. In this study, we analyzed the evolutionary paths of streptococcal and staphylococcal SAgs. RESULTS: We compared the sequences of the 12-60 kb speG regions of nine SDSE strains, five speG(+) and four speG(-). We found that the synteny of this region was highly conserved, whether or not the speG gene was present. Synteny analyses based on genome-wide comparisons of GAS and SDSE indicated that speG is the direct descendant of a common ancestor of streptococcal SAgs, whereas smez was deleted from SDSE after SDSE and GAS split from a common ancestor. Cumulative nucleotide skew analysis of SDSE genomes suggested that speG was located outside segments of steeper slopes than the stable region in the genome, whereas the region flanking smez was unstable, as expected from the results of GAS. We also detected a previously undescribed staphylococcal SAg gene, selW, and a staphylococcal SAg -like gene, ssl, in the core genomes of all Staphylococcus aureus strains sequenced. Amino acid substitution analyses, based on dN/dS window analysis of the products encoded by speG, selW and ssl suggested that all three genes have been subjected to strong positive selection. Evolutionary analysis based on the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method showed that each clade included at least one direct descendant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a plausible model for the comprehensive evolutionary pathway of streptococcal and staphylococcal SAgs.
TI  - [Necrotizing pneumonia - a rare complication].
AB  - Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia associated with destruction of the lung tissue during the infection and rise of necrotic foci in consolidated areas. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Nocardia, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. Risk factors for developing necrotizing pneumonia include smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases or liver disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure. Hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. The authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable progression with medical therapy. In this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: is the bacterial spectrum changing?
AB  - PURPOSE: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, but potentially fatal pathology. The aim of the present study was to identify the population characteristics of the NF patients, the responsible bacteria, and the differences between survivors and nonsurvivors. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, all patients with NF from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, treated in an academic level 1 trauma center, were identified, and their medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: The mortality rate of the 24 identified patients was 20.8 %. The majority of the infections (54.2 %) (13/24) were monomicrobial. Hemolytic Streptococcus of group A (25 %) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20.8 %) were the commonest germs. The mean number of comorbidities was 3.62 (standard deviation (SD) 3.58). Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression were the commonest. Mean number of operations was 8.1 (SD 4.7). Five patients (20.8 %) developed a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); all of them died. Nonsurvivors, who presented with deteriorated coagulation factors, developed a DIC (p < 0.001) and received more often antibiotic monotherapy (ampicillin/sulbactam) as initial empirical therapy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests a shift of the bacterial spectrum towards monomicrobial infections with multiresistant bacteria. The early recognition of high-risk patients and the aggressive surgical treatment with at least double-schema antibiotic therapy are of outmost importance.
TI  - Complement inhibitors from scabies mites promote streptococcal growth--a novel mechanism in infected epidermis?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scabies is highly prevalent in socially disadvantaged communities such as indigenous populations and in developing countries. Generalized itching causes discomfort to the patient; however, serious complications can occur as a result of secondary bacterial pyoderma, commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) or Staphylococcus aureus. In the tropics, skin damage due to scabies mite infestations has been postulated to be an important link in the pathogenesis of disease associated with acute rheumatic fever and heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and systemic sepsis. Treatment of scabies decreases the prevalence of infections by bacteria. This study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between scabies and GAS infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: GAS bacteria were pre-incubated with blood containing active complement, phagocytes and antibodies against the bacteria, and subsequently tested for viability by plate counts. Initial experiments were done with serum from an individual previously exposed to GAS with naturally acquired anti-GAS antibodies. The protocol was optimized for large-scale testing of low-opsonic whole blood from non-exposed human donors by supplementing with a standard dose of heat inactivated human sera previously exposed to GAS. This allowed an extension of the dataset to two additional donors and four proteins tested at a range of concentrations. Shown first is the effect of scabies mite complement inhibitors on human complement using ELISA-based complement activation assays. Six purified recombinant mite proteins tested at a concentration of 50 microg/ml blocked all three complement activation pathways. Further we demonstrate in human whole blood assays that each of four scabies mite complement inhibitors tested increased GAS survival rates by 2-15 fold. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that local complement inhibition plays an important role in the development of pyoderma in scabies infested skin. This molecular link between scabies and bacterial infections may provide new avenues to develop alternative treatment options against this neglected disease.
TI  - Antibiotic optimization and chemical structure stabilization of thiomuracin A.
AB  - Synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin A (1) were initiated to improve chemical stability and physicochemical properties. Functional group modifications of 1 included removing the C2-C7 side chain, derivatizing the C84 epoxide region, and altering the C44 hydroxyphenylalanine motif. The resulting derivatives simplified and stabilized the chemical structure and were evaluated for antibacterial activity relative to 1. The simplified structure and improved organic solubility of the derivatives facilitated isolation yields from fermentation broths and simplified the procedures involved for the process. These advancements increased material supply for continued medicinal chemistry optimization and culminated in the identification of 2, a structurally simplified and chemically stable analogue of 1 which retained potent antibiotic activity.
TI  - Glycerol monolaurate antibacterial activity in broth and biofilm cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycerol monolaurate (GML) is an antimicrobial agent that has potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria. This study examines GML antibacterial activity in comparison to lauric acid, in broth cultures compared to biofilm cultures, and against a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and non-gram staining bacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: GML is >/= 200 times more effective than lauric acid in bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log reduction in colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in broth cultures. Both molecules inhibit superantigen production by these organisms at concentrations that are not bactericidal. GML prevents biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, as representative gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, tested in 96 well microtiter plates, and simultaneously is bactericidal for both organisms in mature biofilms. GML is bactericidal for a wide range of potential bacterial pathogens, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. In the presence of acidic pH and the cation chelator ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, GML has greatly enhanced bactericidal activity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Solubilization of GML in a nonaqueous delivery vehicle (related to K-Y Warming(R)) enhances its bactericidal activity against S. aureus. Both R and S, and 1 and 2 position lauric acid derivatives of GML exhibit bactericidal activity. Despite year-long passage of Staphylococcus aureus on sub-growth inhibitory concentrations of GML (0.5 x minimum bactericidal concentration), resistance to GML did not develop. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GML may be useful as a broad-spectrum human or animal topical microbicide and may be useful as an environmental surface microbicide for management of bacterial infections and contamination.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the Basque Country (Northern Spain).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (EEP/PEP), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. It was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. Results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC from 17 to 26 mg/ml). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [Salmonella enterica (MIC from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against Helicobacter pylori (MIC from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while Escherichia coli was resistant. This concluded that the Basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences (P </= 0.05) between EEP and PEP extracts.
TI  - Antimicrobial and synergistic effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil fungi of high altitudes of eastern himalaya.
AB  - Fifty three fungi isolated from soils of different microhabitats of eastern Himalayan range (3,400~3,600 msl) were screened for mycosynthesis of silver nanaoparticles (AgNPs) and their efficacy as antimicrobials were assessed in combination with commonly used antibiotics. Three isolates Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 identified based on morphological and 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to synthesize AgNPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by visual observation followed by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 showed absorbance maxima at 412, 419, and 421 nm respectively in the visible region. Transmission electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of spherical AgNPs of 5~50 nm size. The antimicrobial activity of the mycosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated alone and in combination with commonly used antibiotics for analysis of growth inhibition zone against test organisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, Salmonella enterica MTCC735 and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729. The mycosynthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity and interestingly their syngergistic effect with erythromycin, methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher as compared to inhibitions by AgNPs alone. The present study indicates that silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil borne indigenous fungus of high altitudes show considerable antimicrobial activity, deserving further investigation for potential applications.
TI  - Case detection rates of impetigo by gender and age.
AB  - A cross sectional study was carried out (impetigo cases n=265, relative prevalence 5.3%, among 50,237 outpatients). Males predominated in childhood, adulthood and overall (OR 2.0) and exhibited a more protracted susceptibility. Impetigo was more prevalent in summer months. Lesions were located on the head and neck (65.4%), followed by 19.6% on an upper extremity and by 7.5% each on the trunk and a lower extremity.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Surveillance Committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2009: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) started a survey in 2006. From 2009, JSC continued the survey in collaboration with the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology. The fourth-year survey was conducted during the period from January and April 2009 by the three societies. A total of 684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 Staphylococcus aureus, 127 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 123 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 78 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5 %) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Identification and antibacterial evaluation of bioactive compounds from Garcinia  kola (Heckel) seeds.
AB  - We assessed the bioactivity of G. kola seeds on Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Salmonella typhimurium. The crude ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, acetone and aqueous extracts were screened by the agar-well diffusion method and their activities were further determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays. The extracts were fractionated by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Bioautography was used to assess the activity of the possible classes of compounds present in the more active extracts. Column chromatography was used to purify the active compounds from the mixture, while GC-MS was used to identify the phytocomponents of the fractions. The inhibition zone diameters of the extracts ranged from 0-24 +/- 1.1 mm, while MIC and MBC values ranged between 0.04-1.25 mg/mL and 0.081-2.5 mg/mL, respectively. The chloroform/ethyl acetate/formic acid (CEF) solvent system separated more active compounds. The MIC of the fractions ranged between 0.0006-2.5 mg/mL. CEF 3 (F3), CEF 11 (F11) and CEF 12 (F12) revealed the presence of high levels of linoleic acid, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl ester, respectively. The results obtained from this study justify the use of this plant in traditional medicine and provide leads which could be further exploited for the development of new and potent antimicrobials.
TI  - Scabies: important clinical consequences explained by new molecular studies.
AB  - In 2004, we reviewed the status of disease caused by the scabies mite Sarcoptes scabiei at the time and pointed out that very little basic research had ever been done. The reason for this was largely the lack of availability of mites for experimental purposes and, to a degree, a consequent lack of understanding of its importance, resulting in the trivial name 'itch mite'. Scabies is responsible for major morbidity in disadvantaged communities and immunocompromised patients worldwide. In addition to the physical discomfort caused by the disease, scabies infestations facilitate infection by bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus via skin lesions, resulting in severe downstream disease such as in a high prevalence of rheumatic fever/heart disease in affected communities. We now have further evidence that in disadvantaged populations living in tropical climates, scabies rather than 'Strep throat' is an important source of S. pyogenes causing rheumatic fever and eventually rheumatic heart disease. In addition, our work has resulted in two fundamental research tools that facilitate much of the current biomedical research efforts on scabies, namely a public database containing ~45,000 scabies mite expressed sequence tags and a porcine in vivo model. Here we will discuss novel and unexpected proteins encountered in the database that appear crucial to mite survival with regard to digestion and evasion of host defence. The mode(s) of action of some of these have been at least partially revealed. Further, newly discovered molecules that may well have a similar role, such as a family of inactivated cysteine proteases, are yet to be investigated. Hence, there are now whole families of potential targets for chemical inhibitors of S. scabiei. These efforts put today's scabies research in a unique position to design and test small molecules that may specifically interfere with mite-derived molecules, such as digestive proteases and mite complement inhibitors. The porcine scabies model will be available to trial in vivo treatment with potential inhibitors. New therapies for scabies may be developed from these studies and may contribute to reduce the spread of scabies and the subsequent prevalence of bacterial skin infections and their devastating sequelae in the community.
TI  - [Recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema in an 11-year-old child].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent perineal erythema is a rare toxin-mediated disease. We report the case of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema in a child. CASE REPORT: An 11-year-old boy was hospitalized for erythematous pustular eruption involving the perineum and the axillary area. This erythema started a few days after the onset of pharyngotonsillitis and the patient's personal history involved another episode of pharyngotonsillitis which was followed by an identical cutaneous eruption. Laboratory analysis confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema. The skin disorder quickly improved and antistreptococcal antibiotic treatment was initiated to eradicate bacteria. DISCUSSION: Recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema is a cutaneous disease mediated by superantigens which are toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci. It is characterized by recurrent macular erythema involving the perineum. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema, with Staphylococcus aureus being isolated most rarely. This observation emphasizes the possibility of atypical clinical presentation with pustular lesions, and dermatologists must be mindful of this aetiology in order to isolate bacterial toxins and to initiate appropriate antibiotics.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excel essential oil.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excel (family Euphorbiaceae) stem bark is used in Cameroon by Baka pygmies as a remedy for wound healing and tetanus. AIM OF THE STUDY: To characterize the chemical composition and to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the essential oil of the plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was extracted from the stem bark by dynamic head space and by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC and GC-MS analyses. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal-fungicidal concentration (MBC-MFC) by the micro and macrodilution methods. The following bacteria and fungi were used: Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida albicans LM 450, Trichophyton mentagrophytes LM 230, Trichophyton rubrum LM 237, Microsporum canis LM 324. RESULTS: The hydrodistillation afforded 0.06% (dry weight basis) of pale yellow oil. Thirty-eight compounds representing 90.69% were identified. The major component (36.40%) was found to be (E)-isoelemicin, identified by comparison of its (1)H-NMR experimental data, with literature data. The oil showed good antibacterial activity against Clostridium Sporogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes with MIC ranging from 13.5 to 126 mug/ml. A weak antifungal activity (MIC 250 mug/ml) was found against Trichophyton rubrum, only. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity and the chemical composition of Phyllanthus muellerianus stem bark essential oil are reported for the first time.
TI  - Naturally occurring swine influenza A virus PB1-F2 phenotypes that contribute to  superinfection with Gram-positive respiratory pathogens.
AB  - A combination of viral, bacterial, and host factors contributes to the severity and overall mortality associated with influenza virus-bacterium superinfections. To date, the virulence associated with the recently identified influenza virus protein PB1-F2 has been largely defined using models of primary influenza virus infection, with only limited assessment in models of Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection. Specifically, these studies have incorporated isogenic viruses that differ in the PB1-F2 expressed, but there is still knowledge to be gained from evaluation of natural variants derived from a nonhuman host species (swine). Using this rationale, we developed the hypothesis that naturally occurring viruses expressing variants of genes, like the PB1-F2 gene, can be associated with the severity of secondary bacterial infections. To test this hypothesis, we selected viruses expressing variants in PB1-F2 and evaluated outcomes from superinfection with three distinct Gram-positive respiratory pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results demonstrate that the amino acid residues 62L, 66S, 75R, 79R, and 82L, previously proposed as molecular signatures of PB1-F2 virulence for influenza viruses in the setting of bacterial superinfection, are broadly associated with enhanced pathogenicity in swine in a bacterium-specific manner. Furthermore, truncated PB1-F2 proteins can preferentially increase mortality when associated with Streptococcus pyogenes superinfection. These findings support efforts to increase influenza virus surveillance to consider viral genotypes that could be used to predict increased severity of superinfections with specific Gram-positive respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Linezolid effects on bacterial toxin production and host immune response: review  of the evidence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is active against a broad range of gram-positive pathogens  and has the potential to also affect production of bacterial toxins and host immune function. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence for direct effects of linezolid on bacterial toxin synthesis and modulation of host immune responses. METHODS: Literature searches were performed of the PubMed and OVID databases. Reviews and non-English language articles were excluded. Articles with information on the effect of linezolid on bacterial toxin synthesis and immune responses were selected for further review, and data were summarized. RESULTS: Substantial in vitro evidence supports effects of linezolid on bacterial toxin production; however, the strength of the evidence and the nature of the effects are mixed. In the case of Staphylococcus aureus, repeated observations support the inhibition of production of certain staphylococcal toxins (Panton-Valentine leukocidin, protein A, and alpha- and beta-hemolysin) by linezolid, whereas only solitary reports indicate inhibition (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, coagulase, autolysins, and enterotoxins A and B) or stimulation (phenol-soluble modulins) of toxin production by linezolid. In the case of Streptococcus pyogenes, there are solitary reports of linezolid inhibition (protein M, deoxyribonuclease, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, and F) or stimulation (immunogenic secreted protein 2 and streptococcal inhibitor of complement-mediated lysis) of toxin production, whereas published evidence for effects on streptolysin O production is conflicting. In vitro data are limited, but suggest that linezolid might also have indirect effects on host cytokine expression through inhibition of bacterial production of toxins. In vivo data from preclinical animal studies and a single clinical study in humans are limited and equivocal insofar as a potential role for linezolid in modulating the host inflammatory response; this is due in part to the difficulty in isolating antimicrobial effects and toxin synthesis inhibitory effects of linezolid from any secondary effects on host inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence supports the possibility that linezolid can inhibit, and in some cases stimulate, toxin production in clinically relevant pathogens. However, more research will be needed to determine the potential clinical relevance of those findings for linezolid.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of crude extracts of prasaprohyai formula and its components against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prasaprohyai formula is a Thai Traditional Medicine which has been used for reducing feverish in child. Fever is a symptom resulting from various infections and diseases. The major cause of fever is bacterial and viral infections. The Prasaprohyai formula and its components potentially have biological activities including antipyretic and antimicrobial activities. It is in a hope to develop the formula and its components for an alternative medicine of infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: To study antibacterial activity of Prasaprohyai formula and its components against pathogenic bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Prasaprohyai formula and its components were extracted by different methods, A: maceration with 95% ethanol followed by evaporation (ET), B: ET followed by freeze drying (EF) and C: water distillation (VO). All extracts were tested against clinical isolates from Thammasat University Hospital, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Disk diffusion and broth dilution methods were performed. RESULTS: Crude extracts of ET had higher yield of extraction than other methods. The results showed that the crude extract from different methods of Syzygium aromaticum (Linn) Merr & Perry (Flower) was effective against all bacterial strains with the inhibition zone ranging from 9 to 19 mm. The VO extract of Prasaprohyai formula showed antibacterial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria in the present study. The activity against Streptococcus pyogenes was found in the VO extract of some components. The ET extracts of Lepidium sativum Linn, Myristica fragrans Houtt (seed) and Myristica fragrans Houtt (aril) had no antibacterial activity against all microorganism. However the EF extracts of this formula and some components were able to mostly inhibit Gram positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that Prasaprohyai formula and its components were able to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria including multiresistant strains. The volatile oil extracts seemed to play an important role in antimicrobial activities. The development of Prasaprohyai formula for alternative medicine will be approached in future.
TI  - [Daptomycin in diabetic patients].
AB  - In diabetic patients, there is a high prevalence of skin or nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, which is associated with an increased risk of local or systemic infections and consequently with greater morbidity and mortality. The microorganisms causing most infections in diabetic ulcers and diabetic foot are S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, although chronic diabetic foot infections are generally polymicrobial, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria. The present article describes experience with daptomycin in the treatment of the most frequent infectious complications in diabetic patients. The Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) registry contains information on 60 patients with skin and soft tissue infections treated with daptomycin, with a success rate of 83%. Other recent studies comparing daptomycin with vancomycin or semi-synthetic penicillins have also shown the efficacy and safety of daptomycin with cure rates of between 70% and 80%. In the European version of the CORE registry, the EUROCORE, diabetic patients who developed bacteremia or endocarditis due to Gram-positive pathogens and who received daptomycin showed success rates of 76.8% and 72%, respectively. No significant differences were found in a study comparing daptomycin or standard therapy with vancomycin in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or antistaphylococcal penicillin in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in diabetic patients with bacteremia or endocarditis. Because of its rapid bactericidal action and scarce adverse effects, daptomycin is an attractive antimicrobial agent in the treatment of Gram-positive infections in diabetic patients, whether in monotherapy or in association with other agents.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Tribulus terrestris and its antimicrobial activity: a novel biological approach.
AB  - In the recent decades, increased development of green synthesis of nanoparticles  is inevitable because of its incredible applications in all fields of science. There were numerous work have been produced based on the plant and its extract mediated synthesis of nanoparticles, in this present study to explore that the novel approaches for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using plant fruit bodies. The plant, Tribulus terrestris L. fruit bodies are used in this study, where the dried fruit body extract was mixed with silver nitrate in order to synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The active phytochemicals present in the plant were responsible for the quick reduction of silver ion (Ag(+)) to metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag(0)). The reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), XRD, FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy. The spherical shaped silver nanoparticles were observed and it was found to be 16-28 nm range of sizes. The diffraction pattern also confirmed that the higher percentage of silver with fine particles size. The antibacterial property of synthesized nanoparticles was observed by Kirby-Bauer method with clinically isolated multi-drug resistant bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The plant materials mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles have comparatively rapid and less expensive and wide application to antibacterial therapy in modern medicine.
TI  - Standardizing an in vitro procedure for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of wound dressings and the assessment of three wound dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A wide selection of wound dressings is available on the market with varying claims of antimicrobial efficacy. A valid standard method for evaluation of their antimicrobial activity in vitro has not been established. In this study we suggest a standardized time-kill assay procedure for antimicrobial activity evaluation of wound dressings in order to make studies more comparable and reproducible. We also tested two silver-containing dressings and one propolis-containing dressing against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using our proposed procedure. METHODS: The following dressings were tested: the ionic silver-containing dressing (ISCD), nanocrystalline silver coated dressing (NSCD) and a propolis-containing dressing (PCD) that is in development. A time-kill assay and the zone of inhibition test were used in the study. RESULTS: NSCD exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against all organisms. ISDC also demonstrated good antibacterial activity although inferior to NSCD. PCD did not show any bactericidal effect. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings we suggest that a time-kill assay with a 1 cm(2) dressing is used for evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of wound dressings, and that the dressings should be exposed to a standardized inoculum of 1-1.5 x 10(6) cfu/mL with Mueller-Hinton broth as the most appropriate medium. PCD requires further research to establish its clinical value.
TI  - Essential oil composition, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of five Etlingera species from Borneo.
AB  - Essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from the rhizomes of Etlingera pyramidosphaera (K. Schum.) R. M. Sm, E. megalocheilos (Griff.) A.D. Poulsen, comb. nov., E. coccinea (Blume) S. Sakai & Nagam, E. elatior (Jack) R. M. Sm, and E. brevilabrum (Valeton) R. M. Sm were analyzed by GCMS. The highest oil yield was obtained from E. pyramidosphaera (0.45%), followed by E. elatior (0.38%), E. coccinea (0.30%), E. brevilabrum (0.28%) and E. megalocheilos (0.25%). The major constituents of the essential oils were oxygenated monoterpenes, followed by sesquiterpenes, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, oxygenated diterpenes and diterpenes. The essential oils from E. pyramidosphaera and E. brevilabrum exhibited the best cytotoxicity against MCF 7 (LC50: 7.5 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)) and HL 60 (LC50: 5.0 mg mL(-1)), respectively. Strong inhibition was also observed for the essential oils of E. coccinea and E. megalocheilos against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 8.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1), and 5.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)) and Streptococcus pyrogenes (MIC: 6.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1) and 8.0 +/- 0.5 mg mL(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of some oxindoles.
AB  - The present work describes the synthesis and spectral analysis of some new 3(Z)-{4-[4-(arylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-ylbenzylidene)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one (5a-j). Ten of the synthesized compounds were screened in vitro against six species of microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Asperigellus niger and Asperigellus clavatus. Most of the compounds exhibited significant antimicrobial activity. All of these compounds were also screened in vitro for the antioxidant activity using DPPH assay. Most of them have shown very significant antioxidant activity.
TI  - [Taxonomic characteristics and mixed communities of wound infection agents in patients of reanimation and surgical departments of a hospital].
AB  - AIM: Study of taxonomical structure ofwound infection agents, prevalence of mixes, and detection of character of their possible connection with the results of various microorganisms population interaction in septic wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microbiological study of material from patients with wound infection (WI), 582 of those were cured in reanimation and intensive therapy departments (RITD; group 1) and 1455 - in surgical departments (SD; group 2), was performed. Taxonomic membership and ability to coexist was determined in 4129 microorganisms strains. Etiological role of the agents was evaluated by using values of consistency rate (CR). Species that were present in more than 50% of samples were considered consistent, in 25 to 50%--additional, and in less than 25%--random. Frequency rates (FR) were also determined, that is the fraction of a certain species (genus) of the microorganism (in %) from all the isolated cultures that correspond to 100%. For the determination of the significance of individual species of the agent in the structure of mixed microorganism populations, FR - their fraction (%) in mixed population from the number of strains of this species that correspond to 100% - was calculated. RESULTS: A significant part of the microorganisms strains, more frequently in reanimation department (65.5%), caused wound suppuration in populations mixed with other species of the agents. In reanimation and surgical departments consistent species of wound infection agents were not detected. A leading etiological role of Staphylococcus aureus (FR 19.2% and 23.9%) was determined, and FR of S. aureus strains in mixes was 64.6% in RITD and 46.8% in SD. The parameters ofotheragents of WI in the comparison groups were similar. However FR among mixes in RITD were significantly higher for streptococci that do not belong to S. pyogenes species (72,5%), and also nonfermentative microorganisms (67,2%), and in SD - in Klebsiella pneumoniae mixes. For agents of wound infection especially in RITD, low species diversity was characteristic and the number of mixes variants is significantly higher. In RITD mixed infections develop more frequently, and the ecological community of microorganisms reaches higher values than in SD. CONCLUSION: During the analysis of microbiologi-cal data in RITD and SD general patterns and specific features of taxonomical structure, prevalence of mixed populations and character of their ecological community in wound infection was determined.
TI  - Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.
TI  - Serious skin infections in children: a review of admissions to Gisborne Hospital  (2006-2007).
AB  - AIM: Serious skin infections are an important and increasing problem in New Zealand children. The highest national rates are in the Tairawhiti (Gisborne) region on the East Coast of New Zealand's North Island, where evidence of significant ethnic disparities exists. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of serious skin infections in children hospitalised in the Tairawhiti region. METHODS: The hospital charts of all children aged 0-14 years admitted to Gisborne Hospital between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2007 for a serious skin infection were retrospectively reviewed and data on a range of variables analysed. RESULTS: There were 163 cases of serious skin infections during the study period with 83% occurring in Maori children. The most common types of infection were cellulitis (38%) and subcutaneous abscesses (36%), and the most frequent sites of infection were the head, face and neck (32%) and lower limbs (32%). A previous episode of skin infection was recorded in 34% of children, with previous hospitalisation in 12%. A skin injury preceded infection in 37% of cases, more than reported in the Auckland and Wellington regions. Of the 77% of children who saw a GP 60% required immediate hospital admission. Compared with figures from the Auckland region, there were longer delays to medical care with a mean duration of symptoms of 2.5 days prior to visiting a GP. The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (48%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (20%) with similar proportions and resistance patterns to other New Zealand settings. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of serious skin infections in the Tairawhiti region are largely similar to those reported in other New Zealand regions. However, some differences in preceding skin injuries and delays in seeking medical care exist which may contribute to the high incidence of hospitalised infections in the region. These differences require further investigation.
TI  - Current concepts in laboratory testing to guide antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is indicated for pathogens contributing to an infectious process that warrants antimicrobial therapy if susceptibility to antimicrobials cannot be predicted reliably based on knowledge of their identity. Such tests are most frequently used when the etiologic agents are members of species capable of demonstrating resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Some organisms have predictable susceptibility to antimicrobial agents (ie, Streptococcus pyogenes to penicillin), and empirical therapy for these organisms is typically used. Therefore, AST for such pathogens is seldom required or performed. In addition, AST is valuable in evaluating the activity of new and experimental compounds and investigating the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Several laboratory methods are available to characterize the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. When the nature of the infection is unclear and the culture yields mixed growth or usual microbiota (wherein the isolates usually bear little relationship to the actual infectious process), AST is usually unnecessary and results may, in fact, be dangerously misleading. Phenotypic methods for detection of specific antimicrobial resistance mechanisms are increasingly being used to complement AST (ie, inducible clindamycin resistance among several gram-positive bacteria) and to provide clinicians with preliminary direction for antibiotic selection pending results generated from standardized AST (ie, beta-lactamase tests). In addition, molecular methods are being developed and incorporated by microbiology laboratories into resistance detection algorithms for rapid, sensitive assessment of carriage states of epidemiologically and clinically important pathogens, often directly from clinical specimens (ie, presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal specimens).
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Protease-armed bacteria in the skin.
AB  - The skin constitutes a formidable barrier against commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which permanently and transiently colonise the skin, respectively. Commensal and pathogenic species inhabiting skin both express proteases. Whereas proteases secreted by commensals contribute to homeostatic bacterial coexistence on skin, proteases from pathogenic bacteria are used as virulence factors, helping them colonise skin with breached integrity of the epithelial layer. From these initial sites of colonisation, pathogens can disseminate into deeper layers of skin, possibly leading to the spread of infection. Secreted bacterial proteases probably play an important role in this process and in the deterrence of innate defence mechanisms. For example, Staphylococcus aureus proteases are essential for changing the bacterial phenotype from adhesive to invasive by degrading adhesins on the bacterial cell surface. Secreted staphylococcal proteases mediate pathogen penetration by degrading collagen and elastin, essential components of connective tissue in the dermis. The activation of the contact system and kinin generation by Streptococcus pyogenes and S. aureus proteases contributes to an inflammatory reaction manifested by oedema, redness and pain. Kinin-enhanced vascular leakage might help bacteria escape into the circulation thereby causing possible systemic dissemination of the infection. The inflammatory reaction can also be fueled by the activation of protease-activated receptors on keratinocytes. Concomitantly, bacterial proteases are involved in degrading antimicrobial peptides, disarming the complement system and neutrophils and preventing the infiltration of the infected sites with immune cells by inactivation of chemoattractants. Together, this provides protection for colonising and/or invading pathogens from attack by antibacterial forces of the skin.
TI  - Skin metastasis in patient with hairy cell leukemia: case report and review of literature.
AB  - The reported case of Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) refers to a 47-year-old man with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, a month and a half history of dyspnea on mild effort and in common daily activities and a purplish-brown cutaneous node on the back of the left hand at the time of hospital admission. Bone marrow aspiration showed an infiltration by a lymphoproliferative malignancy and the following cytochemical studies on bone marrow sample led to diagnosis of HCL. The biopsy of the skin lesion revealed a infiltrate of medium and large-size cells in the dermis with the the same cytologic features of leukemic blasts appearing in the bone marrow, upon which the diagnosis of Leukemia cutis was established. The differential diagnosis of leukemia includes other neoplastic hematopoietic disorders, such as lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, severe megaloblastic anemia, severe lymphocytosis, severe monocytosis, and bone marrow failure. In our case, the skin lesion was surgically removed and then left to heal by secondary intention due to the presence of bacterial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The wound was finally medicated to total healing with Promogran(R), an advanced dressings which consists of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix composed of collagen and oxidised regenerated cellulose. The importance of our case lies in the fact that cases with association of HCL with leukemia cutis are very rare, and furthermore that after the excision of the skin lesion of the left hand, the surgeons heal to let the wound close by secondary intention.
TI  - Autopsy cases of fulminant bacterial infection in adults: clinical onset depends  on the virulence of bacteria and patient immune status.
AB  - To assist physicians in recognizing the potentially fatal onset of symptoms in cases of fulminant bacterial infection, we analyzed 11 autopsy cases of such infection (four caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, four by S. pyogenes, one by S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, one by Staphylococcus aureus, and one by Vibrio vulnificus). Clinicohistopathologic features were evaluated. All patients experienced sudden onset of hypotension and multiple organ failure, leading to unexpected death. Blood culture confirmed bacteremia. The main chief complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms (45%) and limb pain (36%). All had an underlying chronic illness (82%), e.g., a hematologic disorder (36.3%) or liver cirrhosis (27.2%). Necrotizing fasciitis occurred in only 55% of cases, with none involving pneumococcal infection. Laboratory tests typically showed C-reactive protein elevation but without leukocytosis, indicating a high-level inflammatory state. In ten cases, death was attributed to circulatory collapse due to sepsis; severe pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage were present in these cases. The onset of fulminant bacterial infection depends on both virulence of the bacterium and status of the host defense system.
TI  - Toward new therapeutics for skin and soft tissue infections: propargyl-linked antifolates are potent inhibitors of MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Hospital- and community-acquired, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, often attributed to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, present a significant health burden that is associated with increased health care costs and mortality. As these two species are difficult to discern on diagnosis and are associated with differential profiles of drug resistance, the development of an efficacious antibacterial agent that targets both organisms is a high priority. Herein we describe a structure-based drug development effort that has produced highly potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase from both species. Optimized propargyl-linked antifolates containing a key pyridyl substituent display antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pyogenes at MIC values below 0.1 microg/mL and minimal cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Further evaluation against a panel of clinical isolates shows good efficacy against a range of important phenotypes such as hospital- and community-acquired strains as well as strains resistant to vancomycin.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - Discovery of LFF571: an investigational agent for Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. This results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. Alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of C. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-Aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product GE2270 A (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of C. difficile infection. The medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. Structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models of infection were characterized. These studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of LFF571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating C. difficile infection.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel alkylides: 3-O-arylalkyl clarithromycin derivatives with improved antibacterial activities.
AB  - A series of novel alkylides, possessing 3-O-arylalkyl group instead of 3-O-cladinose, were designed, synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. The increased potency clearly ranked by the order of 3-O-(3-aryl-2-propargyl), 3-O-(3-aryl-E-prop-2-enyl), 3-O-(3-aryl-propyl), and 3-O-(3-aryl-Z-prop-1-enyl) groups. Some alkylides, exemplified by 7a, 10a, 21, 22, 26, 27 and 33, showed improved activities against inducible MLS(B) resistance and efflux resistance compared to the second-generation macrolides. Among them, 26 possessed comparable activities against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (MICs of 0.016-0.5 mug/mL). Moreover, 26 displayed dramatically enhanced potency against both efflux resistant and inducibly MLS(B) resistant strains (MICs of 0.125-0.5 mug/mL) resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin (MICs of 1- >254 mug/mL), independent of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of LFF571 against Clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of LFF571, a novel analog of GE2270A that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor Tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of Clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. LFF571 possesses potent activity against C. difficile and most other Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The MIC(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. Comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable activity against Gram-positive organisms: MIC(90)s against C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125 mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium innocuum. MIC(90) for S. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. LFF571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes.
TI  - An in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  - Preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (SA) and silver carboxymethylcellulose (SCM) dressings. An- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI) as- says. Antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (CLSM). Log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for Staphylococcus aureus NCIMB 9518, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Finegoldia magna NCTC 11804T, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662. Log10 reduction was higher for SCM than SA dressing-exposed Escherichia coli (P = 0.035) and P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (P = 0.032), and lower for SCM than SA dressing-exposed Streptococcus pyogenes (P = 0.007), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (P = 0.045), and S. aureus NCTC 8325 (P = 0.012). Both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the CZOI assay. SA dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer than SCM activity when exposed to C. albicans (9 days' activity), E. coli (7 days' activity), F. magna (5 days' activity), and P. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the SMC exhibited greater persistence against S. pyogenes (13 days' activity). CLSM showed complete kill of S. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. The results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. The in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.
TI  - Different potency of bacterial antigens TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  - The aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) generation. We examined Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (LTA) Staphylococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (PGN) Staphylococcus aureus, as well as TLR4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Pophyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. We also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6-, CCL5-, and IL-10-priming on mast cell cysLT synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. We found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cysLT generation; however, the extent of cysLT release in response to stimulation varied. Out of the examined antigens LPS P. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cysLT generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/mL). Other LPSs affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. LTAs were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/mL, while LAM and PGN stimulated mast cells to maximal cysLT generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/mL. Anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor significantly diminished cysLT generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. Priming with TNF, IL-6 and CCL5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cysLT generation, while IL-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cysLT synthesis by mast cells. These observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cysLTs strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.
TI  - Etiology of acute, non-malaria, febrile illnesses in Jayapura, northeastern Papua, Indonesia.
AB  - We conducted a prospective, inpatient fever study in malaria-endemic Papua, Indonesia to determine non-malaria fever etiologies. Investigations included malaria blood films, blood culture, paired serologic samples analysis for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever group rickettsia. During 1997-2000, 226 patients (127 males and 99 females) 1-80 years of age (median age = 25 years) were enrolled. Positive blood cultures (n = 34, 15%) were obtained for Salmonella Typhi (n = 13), Escherichia coli (n = 8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1). Twenty (8.8%) patients were positive for leptospirosis by polymerase chain reaction. Eighty (35.4%) of 226 patients had >/= 1 positive serology, diagnostic for 15 rickettsial and 9 dengue cases. Acid-fast bacilli-positive sputum was obtained from three patients. Most common confirmed (81 of 226, 35.8%)/suspected diagnoses were typhoid fever (n = 41), pneumonia (n = 29), leptospirosis (n = 28), urinary tract infections (n = 20), rickettsioses (n = 19), dengue (n = 17), and meningitis/encephalitis (n = 15). There were 17 deaths, 7 (46.7%) were caused by meningitis/encephalitis. Multiple positive serologic results and few confirmed diagnoses indicate the need for improved diagnostics.
TI  - Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections: review of the epidemiology, microbiology, aetiopathogenesis and treatment: a collaboration between dermatologists and infectivologists.
AB  - Bacterial skin and soft tissues infections (SSTI) often determine acute disease and frequent emergency recovering, and they are one of the most common causes of infection among groups of different ages. Given the variable presentation of SSTI, a thorough assessment of their incidence and prevalence is difficult. The presence of patient-related (local or systemic) or environmental risk factors, along with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, can promote SSTI. These infections may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and different severity, and can be classified according to various criteria. Many bacterial species can cause SSTI, but Gram-positive bacteria are the most frequently isolated, with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The diagnosis of SSTI requires an extended clinical history, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis is particularly important in complicated infections, which often require laboratory studies, diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration. SSTI management should conform to the epidemiology, the aetiology, the severity and the depth of the infection. Topical, oral or systemic antimicrobial therapy and drainage or debridement could be necessary, along with treatment of a significant underlying disease. This review discusses the epidemiology, the pathogenesis and the classification of bacterial SSTI, describes their associated risk factors and their clinical presentations. The authors provide a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to SSTI in respect of antibiotic resistance and currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Gram stain microbiological pattern of upper extremities suppuration at Baptist Medical Centre, Ogbomoso Nigeria: a fifteen month review.
AB  - Sixty-eight (68) patients with serious upper extremity suppurative infections, presenting within a period of fifteen (15) months, were prospectively studied clinically, Gram stain of aspirates/pus were performed, specimen cultured, planted, and where indicated glucose levels and haemoglobin genotype determined. Half of the patients had hand infections. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from thirty-nine (39) patients. Gram Negative bacilli, including Salmonella were more isolated from patients with diabetes mellitus or Hgb SS or SC. The Gram stain results correlated with the culture result 90%. When Gram Positive cocci were demonstrated in the primary microscopic examination, cultures were not mandatory. When no organism was demonstrated on primary Gram stain or the patient was diabetic or a sickler, cultures of the specimens were done. The Gram stain, well performed, remains a useful, inexpensive, technologically appropriate laboratory test for abetting decision making in patients with upper extremity suppurative infections. Organisms encountered in this study included: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Coliforms.
TI  - Management of osteoarticular infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is similar to that of other etiologies: analysis of 199 staphylococcal bone and joint infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and their combination are considered to warrant especially aggressive treatment if caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Our prospective treatment trial of children aged 3 months to 15 years included 199 cases of S. aureus osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or their combination. These cases were compared with 66 cases caused by other agents, mainly Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pyogenes. According to protocol, the treatment was initiated intravenously only for 2 to 4 days and completed orally. Nonstaphylococcal and staphylococcal infections were treated similarly. Primary antibiotics were clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin. Follow-up lasted >/= 12 months posthospitalization. RESULTS: Staphylococcal infections did not significantly differ in the duration of medication, hospital stay, surgery performed, or the number of sequelae when compared with the other etiologic groups. One child with S. aureus arthritis developed 2 late infections by other agents in the same anatomic site. Except 3 mild sequelae (2 caused by S. aureus and 1 by S. pyogenes) 12 months posthospitalization, all patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoarticular infections of childhood caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus can be treated according to the same protocol as those used for infections caused by other agents.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities from leaf extracts of Cassia fistula l.:  An ethnomedicinal plant.
AB  - This study was carried out with an objective to investigate the antibacterial and antifungal potentials of leaves of Cassia fistula Linn. The aim of the study is to assess the antimicrobial activity and to determine the zone of inhibition of extracts on some bacterial and fungal strains. In the present study, the microbial activity of hydroalcohol extracts of leaves of Cassia fistula Linn. (an ethnomedicinal plant) was evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against medically important bacterial and fungal strains. The antimicrobial activity was determined in the extracts using agar disc diffusion method. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of extracts (5, 25, 50, 100, 250 mug/ml) of Cassia fistula were tested against two Gram-positive-Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes; two Gram-negative-Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa human pathogenic bacteria; and three fungal strains-Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans. Zone of inhibition of extracts were compared with that of different standards like ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and chloramphenicol for antibacterial activity and nystatin and griseofulvin for antifungal activity. The results showed that the remarkable inhibition of the bacterial growth was shown against the tested organisms. The phytochemical analyses of the plants were carried out. The microbial activity of the Cassia fistula was due to the presence of various secondary metabolites. Hence, these plants can be used to discover bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals research activities.
TI  - Incidence and etiology of omphalitis in Pakistan: a community-based cohort study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although omphalitis (umbilical infections) among newborns is common and a major cause of neonatal deaths in developing countries, information on its burden and etiology from community settings is lacking. This study aimed to determine the incidence and etiology of omphalitis in newborns in high neonatal mortality settings in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY: Trained community health workers surveyed all new births in three low-income areas from September 2004 to August 2007. Pus samples from the umbilical stumps were obtained from babies with pre-defined signs of illness and subjected to culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Among 6904 births, 1501 (21.7%) newborns were diagnosed with omphalitis. Of these, 325 (21.6%) were classified as mild, 1042 (69.4%) as moderate, and 134 (8.9%) as severe; 141 (9.3%) were associated with clinical signs of sepsis. The incidence of omphalitis was 217.4/1000 live births; moderate-severe omphalitis 170.3 per 1000 live births; and associated with sepsis 20.4 per 1000 live births. Of 853 infants with purulent umbilical discharge, 64% yielded 583 isolates. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, of which 291 (95.7%) were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 13 (4.2%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); Streptococcus pyogenes 105 (18%); Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci 59 (10 %); Pseudomonas spp., 52 (8.9 %); Aeromonas spp. 19 (3.2%); and Klebsiella spp. 12 (2%). CONCLUSIONS: A high burden of omphalitis can be associated with sepsis among newborns in low-income communities in Pakistan. S. aureus is the most common pathogen isolated from umbilical pus. Appropriate low-cost prevention strategies need to be implemented.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, rapidly progressive bacterial soft tissue infection with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although more common in adults, NF also affects the pediatric population. Many bacterial organisms can cause NF, but group A Streptococcus is the most common monomicrobial cause of disease. Necrotizing fasciitis remains principally a clinical diagnosis, and it is often missed early in its presentation because of the difficulty in differentiating it from more common soft tissue infections. The criterion standard for diagnosis and the mainstay of therapy are surgical debridement. Time to initiation and completion of therapy remains the most important factor in patient outcome, highlighting the importance of early recognition and intervention in this potentially devastating disease.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of TD-1792, a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer antibiotic used against Gram-positive bacteria, in a neutropenic murine thigh model.
AB  - TD-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant Gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TD-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. TD-1792, dosed subcutaneously (SC), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSA, MRSA, MSSE, MRSE, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). In single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) CFU kill effective dose (ED(1-log kill)) estimates for TD-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered SC, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ED(stasis)) and ED(1-logkill) doses for TD-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that TD-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. PK-PD analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for MRSA (ATCC 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-MIC ratio (AUC/MIC ratio) was the best predictor of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the MIC (%Time>MIC; r(2) = 0.749). The magnitudes of the total-drug AUC/MIC ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) CFU reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. PK-PD targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - A systematic review of bacteremias in cellulitis and erysipelas.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Because of the difficulty of obtaining bacterial cultures from patients with cellulitis and erysipelas, the microbiology of these common infections remains incompletely defined. Given the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) over the past decade the proportion of infections due to S. aureus has become particularly relevant. METHODS: OVID was used to search Medline using the focused subject headings "cellulitis", "erysipelas" and "soft tissue infections". All references that involved adult patients with cellulitis or erysipelas and reported associated bacteremias and specific pathogens were included in the review. RESULTS: For erysipelas, 4.6% of 607 patients had positive blood cultures, of which 46% were Streptococcus pyogenes, 29% were other beta-hemolytic streptococci, 14% were Staphylococcus aureus, and 11% were Gram-negative organisms. For cellulitis, 7.9% of 1578 patients had positive blood cultures of which 19% were Streptococcus pyogenes, 38% were other beta-hemolytic streptococci, 14% were Staphylococcus aureus, and 28% were Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Although the strength of our conclusions are somewhat limited by the heterogeneity of included cases, our results support the traditional view that cellulitis and erysipelas are primarily due to streptococcal species, with a smaller proportion due to S. aureus. Our results also argue against the current distinction between cellulitis and erysipelas in terms of the relative proportion of infections due to S. aureus.
TI  - The use of topical, un-buffered sodium hypochlorite in the management of burn wound infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burn wound infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The bactericidal action of sodium hypochlorite has been known for centuries and it has been in clinical practice for over 70 years. Whereas a buffered sodium hypochlorite solution is not universally available, an un-buffered solution is cheap and easy to prepare. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the optimum concentration with regard to safety and efficacy, as well as shelf life of an un-buffered sodium hypochlorite solution for the topical management of burn wound infections. METHODS: Human fibroblasts were exposed to serial dilutions of un-buffered sodium hypochlorite solutions for 30 min and assessed for viability. Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to the same dilutions of un-buffered sodium hypochlorite to establish the minimum bactericidal concentration. The pH, osmolality and electrolyte concentrations were measured. These experiments were repeated with solution stored at room temperature for 6 consecutive days. RESULTS: 24% of fibroblasts were viable after exposure to a 0.025% solution and 98.9% with a 0.003% solution. The MBC for the P. aeruginosa isolates was 0.003%, for S. aureus was 0.006% and for S. pyogenes was 0.0015%. This remained constant for 6 consecutive days. The un-buffered 0.0025% solution has a pH of 10, an osmolality of 168 sodium concentration of 89 mmol/dl and chloride of 84 mmol/dl. This remained stable for 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: An un-buffered solution of sodium hypochlorite with a concentration of 0.006% would be suitable for the topical management of burn wound infections caused by common pathogens. It has a shelf life of at least 6 days.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of marine sponge Clathria indica (Dendy, 1889).
AB  - Sponges are sessile filter feeders that have developed efficient defense mechanisms against foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria or eukaryotic organisms. Antimicrobial peptides are known as major components of the innate immune defense system in marine invertebrates. The aim of the present work was to study the antimicrobial properties of the Indian sponge Clathria indica with special reference to the identification of antimicrobial peptides. Crude methanolic extract and its chloroform, n-butanol and aqueous fractions were tested against 16 human pathogens which include eleven bacteria with four of them being multidrug resistant and five pathogenic fungi. All fractions showed effective antibacterial activity against common and multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against C. albicans and C. neoformans. However, they were ineffective against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Chloroform fraction being the most potent among the fractions tested on chemical investigation was indicative of the presence of peptides as evidenced by ninhydrin positive spots on TLC and presence of peptide bonds by NMR. Its ESI-MS showed presence of several peptides in the range of m/z 850 to 980. Structure of three peptides has been tentatively assigned by ESI-MS/MS or tandem mass analysis, on the basis of the amino acid sequence established. The results clearly show that the sponge C. indica represent an interesting source of marine invertebrates-derived antimicrobial peptides in the development of new strategies to treat various infectious diseases.
TI  - Induction of contact-dependent CD8(+) regulatory T cells through stimulation with staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens.
AB  - The bacterial superantigen exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are potent stimulators of polyclonal T-cell proliferation. They are the causes of toxic shock syndrome but also induce CD25(+) FOXP3(+) regulatory cells in the CD4 compartment. Several studies have recently described different forms of antigen-induced regulatory CD8(+) T cells in the context of inflammatory diseases and chronic viral infections. In this paper we show that bacterial superantigens are potent inducers of human regulatory CD8(+) T cells. We used four prototypic superantigens of S. aureus (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A) and Str. pyogenes (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L). At concentrations below 1 ng/ml each toxin triggers concentration-dependent T-cell receptor Vbeta-specific expression of CD25 and FOXP3 on CD8(+) T cells. This effect is independent of CD4(+) T-cell help but requires antigen-presenting cells for maximum effect. The cells also express the activation/regulatory markers cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor-related protein and skin homing adhesins CD103 and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. Superantigen-induced CD25(+) FOXP3(+) CD8(+) T cells were as potent as freshly prepared naturally occurring CD4(+) regulatory T cells in suppressing proliferation of CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. Although superantigen-induced CD8(+) CD25(+) FOXP3(+) express interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma their suppressive function is cell contact dependent. Our findings indicate that regulatory CD8(+) T cells may be a feature of acute bacterial infections contributing to immune evasion by the microbe and disease pathogenesis. The presence and magnitude of regulatory CD8(+) T-cell responses may represent a novel biomarker in such infections. Superantigen-induced regulatory CD8(+) T cells also have therapeutic potential.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  - Gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. To investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. Gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for St. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Bacitracin showed activity for St. pyogenes only. The strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aacA-aphD. The growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of P. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. Furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using S. aureus, S. epidermidis, St. pyogenes, and P. aeruginosa. At doses of more than 32 microg/ml of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. The concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. Therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections in the community.
TI  - Visible light-responsive core-shell structured In(2)O(3)@CaIn(2)O(4) photocatalyst with superior bactericidal properties and biocompatibility.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of photocatalytic substrates is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Visible light-responsive photocatalysts were recently discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. The development of antibacterial photocatalysts, however, has mainly focused on titanium oxide (TiO(2))-related materials with antibacterial properties not comparable with conventional chemical disinfectants. This study demonstrated that a core-shell structured In(2)O(3)@CaIn(2)O(4) substrate has superior visible light-induced bactericidal properties, as compared with several commercially available and laboratory-prepared visible light-responsive photocatalysts. The high performance is enhanced by more easily photoexcited electron transfer between the interfaces of In(2)O(3) and CaIn(2)O(4) to minimize the electron-hole recombination during photocatalysis. Additionally, when compared with TiO(2)-based photocatalysts, In(2)O(3)@CaIn(2)O(4) treatments did not induce significant cell death and tissue damage, implying a superior biocompatibility. These findings suggest that In(2)O(3)@CaIn(2)O(4) may have potential application in the development of a safer and highly bactericidal photocatalyst. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: A photocatalytic susbstrate is described that functions in visible light, possesses bactericidal properties and better biocompatibility than the standard TiO(2) based methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  - A chitosan dextran-based (CD) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. The microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. In addition, the time-kill efficacy of CD hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. CD hydrogel was found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. Minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. Dextran aldehyde (DA) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the CD hydrogel with MBC ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. S. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than E. coli. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to CD hydrogel and DA. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of E. coli and S. aureus incubated with CD hydrogel and DA alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. Motility and chemotaxis tests showed E. coli to be inhibited when incubated with DA. The antibacterial activity of CD hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Invasive bacterial infections in relation to influenza outbreaks, 2006-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to define the excess morbidity associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs), imposed by pandemic H1N1 influenza during 2009-2010 (pH1N1/2009-2010) and seasonal influenza. METHODS: Eight hospitals, accounting for 33% of hospitalizations in Israel, provided data on BSI during 2006-2010. The age-specific incidence of BSI due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes was determined. BSI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) during seasonal and pH1N1 influenza seasons were assessed. RESULTS: Regular influenza seasons were characterized by increased rates of S. pneumoniae BSI but with no increase in S. aureus and S. pyogenes BSI rates. The pH1N1/2009-2010 influenza outbreak was characterized by (1) higher rates of S. pneumoniae bacteremia among children but not among adults (IRRs for S. pneumoniae BSI among children aged 0-4 years during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 14.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5-43.7] and 6.5 [95% CI, 3.6-11.8], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active winter weeks, respectively [P < .0001]), higher rates of S. aureus BSI in all age groups (IRRs during the summer and winter of 2009-2010 were 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.9] and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.7], compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P < .0001]), higher rates of S. pyogenes BSI during 2009-2010 influenza season (IRR 2.7 [95% CI, 1.6-4.6] and 3.3 [95% CI, 1.9-5.8] during the summer and winter of 2009-2010, compared with 2006-2009 summers and influenza-active weeks, respectively [P < .0001]). CONCLUSIONS: pH1N1 influenza seasons were characterized by marked increases in invasive S. aureus and S. pyogenes infections among children and adults, with the highest increase in S. pneumoniae BSI among children.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5 -carboxylate derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a new series of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)-biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine- 5-carboxylate derivatives was synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by (1) H-NMR, mass and C, H, N analyses. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and antifungal (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Penicillium marneffei and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) activity. The results revealed that all synthesized compounds have a significant biological activity against the tested microorganisms. Compounds 8a, 8b, 8c, 8e, 8f, 8i, and 8j exhibited good antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Surveillance of JNJ-Q2 activity tested against Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as a component of the 2010 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel broad-spectrum bactericidal fluorinated 4-quinolone with potent activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens with a balanced potency against both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV targets. JNJ-Q2 is in clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. With the use of reference broth microdilution methods in a central reference laboratory design, MIC values were obtained for 3650 pathogens (44.4% were from patients diagnosed with ABSSSI) obtained during the 2010 SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program. Isolates were collected from patients in 96 medical centers in 26 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. JNJ-Q2 demonstrated good activity overall (MIC(50/90), 0.015/0.5 mug/mL) and against 3081 Staphylococcus aureus with >95% of the isolates inhibited at a MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL; against 1410 levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates, >90% were inhibited by MIC </=0.5 mug/mL. All isolates were inhibited at a MIC of </=2 mug/mL. In addition, JNJ-Q2 demonstrated excellent activity (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/mL) against 569 isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci (including 278 Streptococcus pyogenes and 161 Streptococcus agalactiae). JNJ-Q2 was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested overall and against all pathogens when compared directly to moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Use of a DNA microarray for detection and identification of bacterial pathogens associated with fishery products.
AB  - We established a microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of  diverse putative pathogens often associated with fishery products by targeting specific genes of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Yersinia enterocolitica and the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. The microarray contained 26 specific probes and was tested against a total of 123 target bacterial strains that included 55 representative strains, 68 clinical isolates, and 45 strains of other bacterial species that belonged to 8 genera and 34 species, and it was shown to be specific and reproducible. A detection sensitivity of 10 ng DNA or 10 CFU/ml for pure cultures of each target organism demonstrated that the assay was highly sensitive and reproducible. Mock and real fishery product samples were tested by the microarray, and the accuracy was 100%. The DNA microarray method described in this communication is specific, sensitive, and reliable and has several advantages over traditional methods of bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination assays.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - The effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (CM) caused by gram-positive (Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Mycoplasma, Corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in Holstein dairy cows. Data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in New York State were analyzed. Cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. Generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of CM and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). Primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different CM effects on mortality and culling. Approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of CM in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous cows. Multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). For primipara, CM increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. In multipara, gram-negative CM increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second CM case in lactation. Primiparous cows with CM were more likely to be culled after CM than if they did not have CM, particularly after a second or third case. In multipara, any type of CM increased the probability of being culled. Gram-negative CM cases were associated with the numerically highest risk of culling.
TI  - Adjusted Wallace coefficient as a measure of congruence between typing methods.
AB  - We propose a new coefficient, the adjusted Wallace coefficient (AW), and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) as quantitative measures of congruence between typing methods. The performance of the derived CI was evaluated using simulated data. Published microbial typing data were used to demonstrate the advantages of AW over the Wallace coefficient.
TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.
TI  - NVC-422 topical gel for the treatment of impetigo.
AB  - Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection affecting children worldwide that is caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both. Staphylococcus species can quickly develop drug resistance rendering mupirocin, fusidic acid, and erythromycin ineffective. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that NVC-422 (N, N-dichloro-2, 2-dimethyltaurine) rapidly kills pathogens without the development of drug resistance. 129 patients with clinically diagnosed impetigo were randomized to three dose groups (0.1, 0.5, or 1.5% NVC-422 topical gel) in a study conducted at 2 centers; 125 patients (97%) had microbiologically confirmed infection. Treatment was administered three times a day (TID) for 7 days to all randomized subjects. Response was measured at the completion of treatment (Day 8) and 1 week post treatment (Day 15) by the Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) and by microbiological response. A total of 120 subjects (96%) completed all 7 days of treatment and were assessed at end of treatment (EOT). Clinical response rate at EOT in the PPC population was excellent in each of the dose groups (84.6%, 87.2%, and 92.3% in the 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% dose groups respectively). The majority of the infections were caused by S. aureus, alone (106/125, 85%) of which approximately 10% were MRSA. There were no clinical recurrences in any treatment groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events were seen in 5.4% of the subjects (7/129) and were mild to moderate and resolved. NVC-422 topical gel administered TID was well tolerated, with high rates of clinical and microbiological responses for treating impetigo.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of ultraviolet C (UVC), direct and filtered through transparent plastic, on gram-positive cocci: an in vitro study.
AB  - The prevalence of wound infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is increasing along with concern about widespread use of antibiotics. In vitro studies have shown that ultraviolet radiation, especially UVC, is both an effective bactericidal and antifungal. However, evidence about its bactericidal effect on wounds covered with transparent dressings remains inconclusive. Transparent dressings are used to retain moisture over the wound as part of an intermittent negative pressure dressing-the Limited Access Dressing (LAD) technique. Because this dressing is designed to remain in place for a number of days, an in vitro study was conducted to explore the bactericidal effect of direct and indirect UVR through a transparent 0.15-mm thick transparent polythene sheet on Gram-positive cocci. Six bacterial strains were inoculated to sheep blood agar (SBA) plates and exposed to direct and filtered UVC (254 nm) for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 seconds with one media serving as a control (no UVC exposure). Plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours and bacterial growth observed. Each set of experiment was repeated three times. Direct UVC was shown to have good bactericidal effect (100% eradication of organisms inoculated) at durations ranging from a minimum of 5 seconds (methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pyogenes) to a maximum of 15 seconds (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococci species). No bactericidal effect was observed when UVC was filtered through a 0.15-mm thick transparent polythene sheet. The results confirm the bactericidal effect of UVC in vitro and suggest that this effect can be achieved after a very short period of time. At the same time, film dressings appear to filter UVC. This may help protect skin from exposure to UVC but also limits its utility for use with the LAD technique. In vivo studies to evaluate the shortest effective UVC treatment duration and follow-up clinical studies to ascertain treatment efficacy and effectiveness are needed.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - [The characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. The bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various Gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from June 2005 to December 2006. There were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (S.epidermidis, S. xylosus, S.capitis, S.saccharolyticus), Propionobacterium acnes, Streptococcus spp. (S.agalactiae, S.pyogenes) i Corynebacterium spp. (C. striatum, C. amycolatum, C. aquaticum). In the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. The resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - The inhibition of infection by wound pathogens on scaffold in tissue-forming process using N-acetyl cysteine.
AB  - Prevention of local infection from wound pathogens such as Staphylococci and Streptococci is crucial for tissue regeneration. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant amino acid derivative, has anti-microbial potential against various species. This in vitro study evaluated whether NAC prevented bacterial infection of gingival fibroblasts and osteoblasts on a scaffold. N-acetyl cysteine delayed growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for 12 h in an almost dose-dependent manner (2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mm). The number of rat gingival fibroblasts on collagen scaffolds with bacterial co-incubation was less than 30% of that in cultures without bacterial co-incubation at day 7. However, pre-addition of NAC to the scaffold yielded a number comparable with that in culture without bacteria. Fibroblasts on the scaffold with bacterial co-incubation were small, rounded and filled with bacteria and reactive oxygen species. Pre-addition of NAC, however, resulted in fibroblasts similar to those observed in culture without bacterial co-incubation. N-acetyl cysteine completely prevented devastating suppression of alkaline-phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix mineralization in osteoblastic culture on scaffolds with bacterial co-incubation. These results indicate that NAC can functionalize a scaffold with anti-infective capabilities, thus assisting healing of soft and hard tissues.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against bacteria with dermatological relevance and skin tolerance of the essential oil from Coriandrum sativum L. fruits.
AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the antibacterial activity of essential coriander oil (ECO) on bacteria with dermatological relevance and to assess the skin tolerance of antimicrobial effective ECO concentrations. Essential coriander oil was tested on clinical isolates of different bacteria species, all of which may cause superficial skin infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a standardized macrodilution test. Essential coriander oil showed good antibacterial activity towards the majority of the bacterial strains tested, including Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.04% v/v and 0.25% v/v, respectively. The skin tolerance of a cream and a lotion containing 0.5% and 1.0% ECO was assessed in 40 healthy volunteers using the occlusive patch test. No skin irritation could be observed by sensitive photometric assessment in any of the volunteers. Because of its activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA combined with excellent skin tolerance, ECO might be useful as an antiseptic for the prevention and treatment of skin infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinus fungal ball.
AB  - This case study with chart review describes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of specimens obtained from 47 patients with Aspergillus spp fungus ball. Bacteria were recovered from 32 of the 47 (68%) patients. Eighty-six isolates, 29 aerobic and facultatives and 57 anaerobic, were recovered. Aerobic and facultatives only were recovered in 6 instances (19% of culture-positive specimens), anaerobes only in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 15 (47%). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5 isolates), Enterobacteriacae (4 isolates), and microaerophilic streptococci (4 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-negative bacilli (26), Peptostreptococcus spp (14), and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Twenty-two beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 15 patients. These included all 6 S aureus and 2 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, 4 of 10 of Fusobacteria, and 7 of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas. This study demonstrates the recovery of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in the sinuses of patients with fungus ball.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected ethnomedicinal plants from South India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants Chassalia curviflora Thw. (C. curviflora), Cyclea peltata Hook. F. & Thomson (C. peltata) and Euphorbia hirta L (E. hirta) used in folk medicines in Aarukani hills Kani tribe, Tamil Nadu, India against human bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ATCC 35218), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (ATCC 6538), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) (MTCC 733), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in C. peltata followed by C. curviflora. While E. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. The methanolic extract of C. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of C. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. All the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/mL) of methanolic extract of C. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria S. pyogenes, P. vulgaris and E. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/mL). The methanolic and hexane extracts of C. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. P. vulgaris and S. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. The methanolic and hexane extracts of E. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. S. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation revealed that the C. curviflora, C. peltata and E. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.
TI  - In vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic activity of NXL103 versus clindamycin and linezolid against clinical Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates.
AB  - NXL103 (linopristin/flopristin, 30/70) is a novel oral streptogramin combination  with activity against a large variety of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of NXL103 in comparison with oral comparators (clindamycin and linezolid). Six clinical isolates [four meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two Streptococcus pyogenes] were exposed for 48 h in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model at a starting inoculum of ca. 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Antimicrobial simulations included NXL103 500 mg every 12 h, linezolid 600 mg every 12 h and clindamycin 450 mg every 6 h. Bactericidal and static effects were defined as >/=3log(10) and <3log(10) CFU/mL kill from the starting inoculum, respectively. Experiments were performed in duplicate to ensure reproducibility, and differences between regimens were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc test. NXL103 exhibited lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than comparators, with values </=0.06 mg/L for S. pyogenes and 0.125-0.25 mg/L for MRSA isolates. In the PK/PD model, NXL103 demonstrated significantly better activity than linezolid and clindamycin (P<0.05), achieving sustained bactericidal activity within <2 h against S. pyogenes strains and between 7.3-32 h against MRSA isolates. In contrast, linezolid only exhibited a static effect, whereas clindamycin achieved 3log(10) kill at 6h against the unique clindamycin-susceptible S. pyogenes strain evaluated. In conclusion, at therapeutic concentrations NXL103 exhibits promising activity against both MRSA and S. pyogenes strains, including clindamycin-resistant organisms. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to explore the therapeutic benefit of NXL103 for the treatment of Gram-positive skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - [The use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases].
AB  - The use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases has a long tradition. Initially immunoglobulins from hyperimmunised animals were used for their antitoxic and antimicrobial activity. The development of preparations of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and the observations of their long-term use enabled to assess their usefulness in the treatment of the diseases of proven or probable infectious etiology. In the treatment of infectious diseases IVIG are currently used as immunomodulating drugs or immunosuppressive therapy, more frequently than the specific antibodies against the viruses, bacteria or their toxins. In practice of the infectious ward IVIG are used as a drug of choice in the treatment of Kawasaki disease, in toxic epidermolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. As adjunctive therapy IVIG are used in the infection with parvovirus B19, in hemophagocytic syndrome, for treatment of infections presenting with a severe toxemia caused by Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The rationale for the use of IVIG may be also serious infections caused by enteroviruses, particularly neuroinfections. The use of IVIG in the treatment of sepsis is controversial, since their effectiveness is not proven.
TI  - A potential probiotic culture ST2 produces siderophore 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine under intestinal conditions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterise siderophores of a culture bearing better probiotic qualities of human origin. In this direction, bacterial strain ST2 was isolated from faecal sample of 6-month-old healthy infant, which showed close similarity with Escherichia coli based on 16S r-RNA gene sequence analysis and biochemical characteristics. It was tested for siderophore production under in vitro iron limiting intestinal conditions. The siderophore produced was catecholate type of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine on the basis of FTIR, NMR and mass spectra analysis. The strain obeyed probiotic properties as per WHO and FAO guidelines. It showed excellent tolerance in partially simulated gastro-intestinal tract conditions, non-haemolytic nature, susceptibility to many antibiotics tested and antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Hence, this culture could be a possible probiotic candidate in iron nutrition, but only after conducting proper animal and human trials.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  - The primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. Additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both swine and humans. A total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. Of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. Laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). The most commonly isolated bacteria included: Streptococcus suis (53.7%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (29.9%), Pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and Streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). Virus screening revealed evidence of PRRSV and PCV-2 in 22.0% and 11.9% of the samples, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. Tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for Staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (OR) = 7.51, confidence interval (CI) = 2.89 to 19.54], Streptococcus porcinus (OR = 9.93, CI = 4.27 to 23.10), and Streptococcus suis (OR = 2.16, CI = 1.45 to 3.24). Tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.05, CI = 0.005 to 0.482).
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of plasma-mediated bipolar radiofrequency ablation on bacteria and fungi relevant for wound infection.
AB  - Infection constitutes an important part of wound pathology and impedes wound healing. Plasma-mediated bipolar radiofrequency ablation (Coblation((R))) is a tissue-removal technique suggested for use in wound treatment. The aims of this study were to determine the antimicrobial effect of ablation exposure on bacteria and fungi relevant to wound infection, and how exposure time, temperature and aerobic/anaerobic growth influence the effect. Suspensions of 10(6) colony-forming units/ml of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were exposed to ablation or thermal control for 500, 1000 or 2000 ms, or left untreated, and incubated aerobically. E. coli was also incubated anaerobically. Ablation was significantly (p < 0.0001) microbicidal on all strains compared with untreated and thermal control. The reductions compared with untreated control were 99.87-99.99% for all strains. In conclusion, plasma-mediated bipolar radio-frequency ablation has a general microbicidal effect in vitro on microbes relevant to wound infection independent of aerobic/anaerobic growth and thermal effect.
TI  - Synthesis of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives containing benzothiazoles as pharmacologically active molecule.
AB  - In attempt to make significant pharmacologically active molecule, we report here  the synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial and antitubercular activity of various series of 3-(3-pyridyl)-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-4-(N-substituted-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amino)-4H-1,2 ,4-triazole. The antimicrobial activity of title compounds were examined against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus clavatus) using the broth microdilution method and antitubercular activity H(37)Rv using Lowenstein-Jensen agar method.
TI  - [Bacterial dermohypodermitis and necrotizing fascitis: 104-case series from Togo].
AB  - The purpose of this retrospective study was to obtain data on the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcome of bacterial dermohypodermitis (BDH) observed in a hospital setting hospital in Lome, Togo. Cases of BDH treated in dermatology and internal medicine of the Lome university hospital center from January 1999 to December 2009 were reviewed. A total of 104 patients were hospitalized for BDH during the study period. Mean patient age was 42.9 +/- 16.1 years and sex ratio (M/F) was 0.89. Infection by HIV was detected in 10 of 37 patients in whom serology was performed. The site of erysipelas was located on the legs and feet in 93 cases (89.4%), entire lower limb in 4 (3.9%), upper limbs in 4 (3.9%), thighs in 2 (1.9%), and buttock in 1 (0.9%). The main local and systemic risk factors were existence of an entry site in 89 cases, use of depigmenting drugs in 11, HIV infection in 10, previous history of erysipelas in 9 cases, and lymphoedema in 8. First-line treatment used penicillin G in 90 cases. Seven patients presented necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis was associated with HIV infection in 2 cases, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in 2, and use of depigmenting drugs in one. Two deaths were recorded in the necrotizing fasciitis group including one HIV-infected patient. Recurrence was observed in 8 patients and secondary complications such as lower limb elephantiasis occurred in 7 patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial sesquiterpenoids from Laurus nobilis L.
AB  - Activity-guided fractionations of leaf extracts from Laurus nobilis L. led to the isolation of a known sesquiterpene lactone, deacetyl laurenobiolide (1). Compound 1 showed antimicrobial activity against periopathic pathogens (Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus). Furthermore, acetylation and cyclisation of deacetyl laurenobiolide (1) yielded laurenobiolide (2) and a new compound, (5S,6R,7S,8S,10R)-6,8-dihydroxyeudesma-4(15),11(13)-dien-12-oic acid 12,8-lactone (3), respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 also showed antimicrobial activities. All compounds 1-3 demonstrated growth inhibitory effects with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31 to 1000 microg mL(-1). This is the first report of compounds 1-3 showing antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Bignoniaceae) as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study evaluated, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of the hexane extract  (JCHE), methanol extract (JCME), and chloroform fraction (JCCF) of bark from Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Family Bignoniaceae), a Brazilian medicinal plant, traditionally used as anti-syphilis and anti-gonorrhea treatment. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion method followed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. JCHE was not active against the bacteria evaluated. JCME presented antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 16.3 mg/mL, 9.1 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. JCCF was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, S. pyogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 18.3 mg/mL, 9.3 mg/mL, 6.3 mg/mL, 6.1 mg/mL, 9.2 mg/mL, 6.2 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical analysis of JCME and JCCF gave positive results for saponins, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, quinones, alkaloids, triterpenes, and steroids. Verbascoside was isolated and identified as a major peak in JCME and JCCF high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and might contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Synthesis of 4-hydroxycoumarin heteroarylhybrids as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A new series of 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives 3a-d was synthesized by the reaction of 3-bromo-4-hydroxy coumarin 1 with various heteroaldehydes 2a-d in good yields. The synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of their elemental and spectral (IR, (1)H-NMR and mass spectrometry) analysis. All target compounds were evaluated for their in-vitro antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia coli bacterial strains and fungal cultures of Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Penicillium marneffei by disk diffusion assay with slight modifications. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for the test compounds as well as for reference standards. Among the tested compounds, 3a has shown the most potent antibacterial as well as antifungal activities.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effects of polyphenolic compounds from olive mill wastewater.
AB  - Polyphenols or phenolic compounds are groups of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants and found in olive mill wastewater (OMW). Phenolic compounds as well as OMW extracts were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Most of the tested phenols were not effective against the four bacterial strains when tested as single compounds at concentrations of up to 1000 mug mL(-1). Hydroxytyrosol at 400 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. Gallic acid was effective at 200, and 400 mug mL(-1) against S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively, but not against the gram negative bacteria. An OMW fraction called AntiSolvent was obtained after the addition of ethanol to the crude OMW. HPLC analysis of AntiSolvent fraction revealed that this fraction contains mainly hydroxytyrosol (10.3%), verbascoside (7.4%), and tyrosol (2.6%). The combinations of AntiSolvent/gallic acid were tested using the low minimal inhibitory concentrations which revealed that 50/100-100/100 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. These results suggest that OMW specific fractions augmented with natural phenolic ingredients may be utilized as a source of bioactive compounds to control pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial virulence in the moonlight: multitasking bacterial moonlighting proteins are virulence determinants in infectious disease.
AB  - Men may not be able to multitask, but it is emerging that proteins can. This capacity of proteins to exhibit more than one function is termed protein moonlighting, and, surprisingly, many highly conserved proteins involved in metabolic regulation or the cell stress response have a range of additional biological actions which are involved in bacterial virulence. This review highlights the multiple roles exhibited by a range of bacterial proteins, such as glycolytic and other metabolic enzymes and molecular chaperones, and the role that such moonlighting activity plays in the virulence characteristics of a number of important human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
TI  - Human leukocyte antigen class II transgenic mouse model unmasks the significant extrahepatic pathology in toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Among the exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, the superantigens (SAgs) are the most potent T-cell activators known to date. SAgs are implicated in several serious diseases including toxic shock syndrome (TSS), Kawasaki disease, and sepsis. However, the immunopathogenesis of TSS and other diseases involving SAgs are still not completely understood. The commonly used conventional laboratory mouse strains do not respond robustly to SAgs in vivo. Therefore, they must be artificially rendered susceptible to TSS by using sensitizing agents such as d-galactosamine (d-galN), which skews the disease exclusively to the liver and, hence, is not representative of the disease in humans. SAg-induced TSS was characterized using transgenic mice expressing HLA class II molecules that are extremely susceptible to TSS without d-galN. HLA-DR3 transgenic mice recapitulated TSS in humans with extensive multiple-organ inflammation affecting the lung, liver, kidneys, heart, and small intestines. Heavy infiltration with T lymphocytes (both CD4(+) and CD8+), neutrophils, and macrophages was noted. In particular, the pathologic changes in the small intestines were extensive and accompanied by significantly altered absorptive functions of the enterocytes. In contrast to massive liver failure alone in the d-galN sensitization model of TSS, findings of the present study suggest that gut dysfunction might be a key pathogenic event that leads to high morbidity and mortality in humans with TSS.
TI  - Foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. There is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (POL) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. Four bacterial strains were tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. Although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. No inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with POL in of any of the tested strains. CONCLUSIONS: Foam sclerotherapy with POL prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. The use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with POL more elaborate and more expensive to use.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and the justification of  a novel fusidic acid dosing regimen: raising Lazarus from the dead.
AB  - Perhaps the most crucial step in the clinical development of an antimicrobial agent is the selection of a dosing regimen. Such decisions impact not only the success of a program but also the well being of individual patients, the emergence of resistance, and society as a whole. For fusidic acid, the selection of a dosing regimen for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) was based on the integration of knowledge gained from human population pharmacokinetic, in vitro infection, and mathematical models. The overarching goal of these studies was to identify a dosing regimen that would maximize the probabilities of positive clinical outcomes and limit the emergence of bacterial resistance during therapy. Novel dosing regimens identified included 1500 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice daily for 10-14 days, a regimen that was subsequently found to be effective in a phase 2 clinical study of patients with ABSSSI. Herein, we review the data supporting the use of this novel fusidic acid dosing regimen, which will undergo further clinical evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial findings for fusidic acid tested against contemporary (2008-2009) gram-positive organisms collected in the United States.
AB  - Fusidic acid has a long history of consistent activity against staphylococcal pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Fusidic acid (CEM-102) was susceptibility tested against a surveillance study collection of 12,707 Gram-positive pathogens (2008-2009) from the United States. Reference broth microdilution method results demonstrated the following MIC(50/90) results: S. aureus (.12/.25 mug/mL), coagulase-negative staphylococci (.12/.25 mug/mL), enterococci (4/4 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (4/8 mug/mL), and viridans group Streptococcus spp. (>8/>8 mug/mL). At a proposed susceptible breakpoint (</=1 mug/mL), fusidic acid inhibited 99.7% of MRSA strains and 99.3% to 99.9% of multidrug-resistant phenotypes of S. aureus. Furthermore, S. aureus strains nonsusceptible to fusidic acid (.35%) generally had detectable resistance mechanisms (fusA, B, C, and E). Reviews of in vitro susceptibility test development confirm the accuracy and intermethod reproducibility of various fusidic acid methods. Fusidic acid is a promising oral therapy for staphylococcal skin and skin structure infections in the United States, where the contemporary S. aureus population remains without significant resistance.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - Gram-positive bacterial superantigen outside-in signaling causes toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci) are Gram-positive pathogens capable of producing a variety of bacterial exotoxins known as superantigens. Superantigens interact with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells to induce T cell proliferation and massive cytokine production, which leads to fever, rash, capillary leak and subsequent hypotension, the major symptoms of toxic shock syndrome. Both S. aureus and group A streptococci colonize mucosal surfaces, including the anterior nares and vagina for S. aureus, and the oropharynx and less commonly the vagina for group A streptococci. However, due to their abilities to secrete a variety of virulence factors, the organisms can also cause illnesses from the mucosa. This review provides an updated discussion of the biochemical and structural features of one group of secreted virulence factors, the staphylococcal and group A streptococcal superantigens, and their abilities to cause toxic shock syndrome from a mucosal surface. The main focus of this review, however, is the abilities of superantigens to induce cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells, which has been linked to a dodecapeptide region that is relatively conserved among all superantigens and is distinct from the binding sites required for interactions with APCs and T cells. This phenomenon, termed outside-in signaling, acts to recruit adaptive immune cells to the submucosa, where the superantigens can then interact with those cells to initiate the final cytokine cascades that lead to toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - Cutaneous diphtheria in the urban poor population of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: a 10-year review.
AB  - Between 1998 and 2007, records from 33 patients with cutaneous diphtheria from Vancouver's inner city were reviewed. Cases were associated with injection drug use and poverty. Coinfections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum occurred. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is endemic in Vancouver's urban core, with strains of multilocus sequence type (MLST) 76 predominating.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - To study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. The microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. The bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. All honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. Coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
TI  - Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of fusidic acid against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes using in vitro infection models: implications for dose selection.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) of fusidic acid were investigated against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes using in vitro infection models. Front-loaded and non-front-loaded fusidic acid dosing regimens were evaluated over 48 h using a 1-compartment infection model and over 240 h using a hollow fiber infection model (HFIM). All dosing regimens demonstrated initial decreases in bacterial density against both isolates in both in vitro models. A mechanism-based PK-PD model was developed to describe the effect of the concentration-time course of fusidic acid on the time course of MRSA in the in vitro infection model. With the use of this model and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the effect of different dosing regimens against MRSA, front-loaded [>/= 1200 mg every 12 h (Q12) x 2 doses followed by >/= 600 mg Q12 h] compared to non-front-loaded (600 mg Q12 h) dosing regimens demonstrated better activity. HFIM data confirmed the effect of the front-loaded dosing regimens over 48 h and also demonstrated the suppression of growth of the total population and resistant subpopulations for MRSA over 96 and 120 h, respectively, associated with these dosing regimens.
TI  - Comparative study of immune status to infectious agents in elderly patients with  multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
AB  - Whereas patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have a well-documented susceptibility to infections, this has been less studied in other B-cell disorders, such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). We investigated the humoral immunity to 24 different pathogens in elderly patients with MM (n = 25), WM (n = 16), and MGUS (n = 18) and in age-matched controls (n = 20). Antibody titers against pneumococci, staphylococcal alpha-toxin, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, and varicella, mumps, and rubella viruses were most depressed in MM patients, next to lowest in WM and MGUS patients, and highest in the controls. In contrast, levels of antibodies specific for staphylococcal teichoic acid, Moraxella catarrhalis, candida, aspergillus, and measles virus were similarly decreased in MM and MGUS patients. Comparable titers in all study groups were seen against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), borrelia, toxoplasma, and members of the herpesvirus family. Finally, a uniform lack of antibodies was noted against Streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella, yersinia, brucella, francisella, and herpes simplex virus type 2. To conclude, although MM patients displayed the most depressed humoral immunity, significantly decreased antibody levels were also evident in patients with WM and MGUS, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, and varicella. Conversely, immunity was retained for Hib and certain herpesviruses in all study groups.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil: a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil, the prodrug of the active metabolite, ceftaroline, is a new, broad-spectrum cephalosporin recently approved in the USA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Ceftaroline has potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common Gram-negative organisms. The high affinity of ceftaroline for penicillin-binding proteins is responsible for the potent activity observed against clinically relevant pathogens. With respect to the treatment of CABP, the activity of ceftaroline against pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis demonstrates coverage across a broad range of pathogens typically encountered in clinical practice. Ceftaroline is also very active against common pathogens seen in ABSSSIs such as S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. Ceftaroline exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile, similar to other renally excreted cephalosporins, and has a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class. Ceftaroline fosamil is compatible via Y-site administration with many other commonly administered parenteral drugs.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of adult chronic dacryocystitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic dacryocystitis results in chronic infection and inflammation of the lacrimal sac. OBJECTIVE: To identify the aetiology of chronic dacryocystitis and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross - sectional study was undertaken including 120 lacrimal swab materials collected from patients aged above 15 years suffering from chronic dacryocystitis. STATISTICS: Data analysis was done by using software "Win pepi'' ver 7.9. RESULTS: The bacteria of eight different species were isolated from 76.66 % (92/120) culture positive samples. 85.86 % showed a single and 14.13 % showed a mixed growth pattern. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common bacteria (P= 0.018) accounting for 33.96 % followed by Staphylococcus aureus (25.46 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 19.81 % ), Streptococci viridans (5.66 %), Escherichia coli (5.66 %), Haemophilus spp ( 4.71 % ), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.77 %) and Bacillus spp (0.94 % ). Staphylococcus aureus were the most predominant bacteria in mixed growth. Rate of infection was higher in males 81.39 % than in females 74.02 %. Infection was higher in the age group of above 31 years. In the antimicrobial susceptibility test, except staphylococcus aureus, all the Gram positive isolates were 100 % sensitive to chloramphenicol and were least sensitive to tobramycin, but Gram negative isolates were equally sensitive to Chloramphenicol and Nalidixic acid. CONCLUSION: Coagulase negative staphylococci are the most frequently isolated bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is predominantly found in mixed growth. Chloramphenicol is the most effective drug of choice for chronic dacryocystitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - CONTEXT: Development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. Twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. Eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. Powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Water extract of Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of Ficus carica L. (Moraceae) and Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) leaves and Peganum harmala L. (Nitrariaceae) seeds had MIC ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. S. aromaticum inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. F. carica and O. europaea inhibited growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pyogenes whereas P. harmala was effective against S. aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Candida albicans. Ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had MIC >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in Lebanese patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We conducted a study of 32 Lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. Polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. The presence or absence of S aureus enterotoxin A, B, C, and D (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. Biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. A total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. Of these, only 3 (8.8%) were S aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin B). Moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. Our results could not confirm that S aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the Lebanese group studied.
TI  - [Arthritis and osteitis at the hand].
AB  - Septic arthritis and osteitis at the hand are associated with a high morbidity. Trauma is the major cause for these infections. In the majority of cases the fingers are involved. Causative microorganisms are predominantly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, an increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria have been found in hand infections. As differential diagnosis, tumours and non-septic arthritis must be considered. Treatment includes surgical debridement, immobilisation and functional rehabilitation. Crucial for the surgical strategy are the virulence of the pathogens, the resistance of the patient and the location of the infection. If functional recovery cannot be expected, salvage procedures like arthrodeses and resection arthroplasties are sometimes required. Surgical treatment is sufficient in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the hand. However, to avoid permanent disability, rapid diagnosis and therapy are essential. This review describes our treatment concepts in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis at the hand.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - Bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. Its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed by appropriate antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. METHODS: Pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. Identification of different microorganisms was made on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology and standard biochemical reactions. Susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. Positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. Among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. From six samples no organisms could be cultured. Altogether Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and Staphylococcus aureus from five samples. Other isolated organisms included Haemophlilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. Penicillin was effective for Streptococcus pyogenes whereas Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to it. Cloxacillin was found to be effective for Staphylococcus aureus. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were more commonly associated with peritonsillar abscess. Streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. This fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of stem bark extracts from Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The plants of the genus Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae) are widely distributed in most tropical and subtropical countries, and have long been used in folk medicine to treat several diseases. Particularly, Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell, commonly called "mbolongo" in Cameroon, is used by pygmies baka as a remedy for tetanus and wound infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antimicrobial properties of Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell (family Euphorbiaceae) stem bark used in Cameroon by baka pygmies as a remedy for wound healing and tetanus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and methanol extracts with and without defatting treatment, were prepared and their activity against Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal-fungicidal concentration (MBC-MFC) by the macrodilution method. RESULTS: Water extract showed a weak activity against Clostridium sporogenes (MIC 900 mug/mL) and resulted inactive at the tested concentrations against all the other microorganisms. The defatted methanol extract, inactive against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, exhibited a very interesting activity against Clostridium sporogenes and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 100 mug/mL and 300 mug/mL, respectively), which seems to validate the use of this plant in pygmies traditional medicine for the treatment of tetanus and wound infections. The activity found against Streptococcus mutans (300 mug/mL), aetiological agent of caries, may suggest a possible use of this plant as natural remedy to prevent dental diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The activity against streptococci and Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, showed by stem bark extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus, traditionally used by baka pygmies to treat wound infections and tetanus, is reported for the first time.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2009].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2009, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms was available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.06 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was equal to that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 2 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 8 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/mL and were 1 to 2 times lower than those of GRNX, 2 to 4 times lower than those of MFLX, and 16 to 32 times lower than those of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.25 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 2 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for E. coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90s of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 8 microg/mL and was 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 2 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX and MFLX, and 16 times lower than that of LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 2 to 4 times lower than those of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX, and 4 times lower than those of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.008 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90s of STFX ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during the period from January to April 2008. A total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 Staphylococcus aureus, 211 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 187 Haemophilus influenzae, 106 Moraxella catarrhalis, 126 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 13.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5%) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Growth factor-enriched autologous plasma improves wound healing after surgical debridement in odontogenic necrotizing fasciitis: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Odontogenic necrotizing fasciitis of the neck is a fulminant infection of odontogenic origin that quickly spreads along the fascial planes and results in necrosis of the affected tissues. It is usually polymicrobial, occurs frequently in immunocompromised patients, and has a high mortality rate. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year old Mexican male had a pain in the maxillar right-canine region and a swelling of the submental and submandibular regions. Our examination revealed local pain, tachycardia, hyperthermia (39 degrees C), and the swelling of bilateral submental and submandibular regions, which also were erythematous, hyperthermic, crepitant, and with a positive Godet sign. Mobility and third-degree caries were seen in the right mandibular canine. Bacteriological cultures isolated streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. The histopathological diagnosis was odontogenic necrotizing fasciitis of the submental and submandibular regions. The initial treatment was surgical debridement and the administration of antibiotics. After cultures were negative, the surgical wound was treated with a growth factor-enriched autologous plasma eight times every third day until complete healing occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with a growth factor-enriched autologous plasma caused a rapid healing of an extensive surgical wound in a patient with odontogenic necrotizing fasciitis. The benefits were rapid tissue regeneration, an aesthetic and a functional scar, and the avoidance of further surgery and possible complications.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - Confirmation of HIV-like sequences in respiratory tract bacteria of Cambodian and Kenyan HIV-positive pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and yeasts isolated from respiratory tracts of 39 Cambodian  and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children were tested for the presence of HIV-1 sequences. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract (nose, pharyngeal swabs) were isolated from 39 Cambodian and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard protocol and by Qiagen kit. The PCR specific for HIV sequences was carried out using HIV-1-specific primers.The analysis was performed by colony and dot-blot hybridization using HIV-1-specific primers which represent gag, pol and env genes of the virus. The sequencing of some PCR products was performed on the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer. RESULTS: The majority of microbes were characterized as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resp. Candida albicans. In some cases E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Candida tropicalis were identified. Bacteria of 16 Cambodian (41%) and 8 Kenyan (31%) children were found to be positive in colony and dot-blot DNA hybridization. By the sequencing of PCR products synthesized on the template of patients' bacterial DNA using primers 68;69 for env HIV-1 gene, homology of greater than 90% with HIV-1 isolate HXB2 (HIVHXB2CG) was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract of 41% of Cambodian and 31% of Kenyan HIV-positive children bear HIV-like sequences. The role of bacteria in the HIV disease process is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of dalbavancin and telavancin against staphylococci and streptococci isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - Two novel lipoglycopeptides, dalbavancin and telavancin, and relevant comparative agents were tested for in vitro activity against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci collected in the cross-Canada surveillance study, CANWARD, in 2007-2009. The rank order of potency (based on MIC(90) [mug/mL], i.e., the concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit the growth of 90% of isolates tested) of glycopeptides against both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was dalbavancin (0.06 mug/mL) >telavancin (0.5 mug/mL) > vancomycin (1-2 mug/mL); concurrent susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin in staphylococci did not affect potency of glycopeptides. Dalbavancin and telavancin also demonstrated potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates (MIC(90), </= 0.03 mug/mL; </= 0.06 mug/mL), and Streptococcus pyogenes (</= 0.03 mug/mL; 0.06 mug/mL). Based on their robust in vitro activities, dalbavancin and telavancin have the potential to treat Gram-positive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Interferon gamma-dependent intestinal pathology contributes to the lethality in bacterial superantigen-induced toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by the superantigen exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes is characterized by robust T cell activation, profound elevation in systemic levels of multiple cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), followed by multiple organ dysfunction and often death. As IFN-gamma possesses pro- as well as anti-inflammatory properties, we delineated its role in the pathogenesis of TSS. Antibody-mediated in vivo neutralization of IFN-gamma or targeted disruption of IFN-gamma gene conferred significant protection from lethal TSS in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. Following systemic high dose SEB challenge, whereas the HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(+/+) mice became sick and succumbed to TSS, HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) mice appeared healthy and were significantly protected from SEB-induced lethality. SEB-induced systemic cytokine storm was significantly blunted in HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice. Serum concentrations of several cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40 and IL-17) and chemokines (KC, rantes, eotaxin and MCP-1) were significantly lower in HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice. However, SEB-induced T cell expansion in the spleens was unaffected and expansion of SEB-reactive TCR Vbeta8(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was even more pronounced in HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice when compared to HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(+/+) mice. A systematic histopathological examination of several vital organs revealed that both HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(+/+) and HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice displayed comparable severe inflammatory changes in lungs, and liver during TSS. Remarkably, whereas the small intestines from HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(+/+) transgenic mice displayed significant pathological changes during TSS, the architecture of small intestines in HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice was preserved. In concordance with these histopathological changes, the gut permeability to macromolecules was dramatically increased in HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(+/+) but not HLA-DR3.IFN-gamma(-/-) mice during TSS. Overall, IFN-gamma seemed to play a lethal role in the immunopathogenesis of TSS by inflicting fatal small bowel pathology. Our study thus identifies the important role for IFN-gamma in TSS.
TI  - Life-threatening cellulitis after traditional Samoan tattooing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Traditional Samoan tattooing is a significant and valued cultural practice. Any tattooing carries a risk of complications, including the potential for serious bacterial infection. We discuss the complex nature of the public health investigation into two cases of serious bacterial infection following traditional tattooing occurring in the same region in New Zealand within a six-week period. APPROACH: Description of two cases of life-threatening cellulitis (one with necrotising fasciitis) related to traditional Samoan tattooing and presentation of findings from the public health investigation. Discussion of the complex legal and cultural issues that arose. CONCLUSION: Our paper illustrates the potential for serious bacterial infection by tattooing when performed in a non-sterile manner. There are gaps in the regulatory framework available in New Zealand to address the public health risks of unsafe tattooing practices. IMPLICATIONS: It is important to balance the fundamental right to perform the traditional cultural practice of tattooing with the need for meticulous infection control. Reducing the risk of infection will require working in partnership with the community to develop acceptable standards and guidelines and to improve the regulatory framework.
TI  - The antibacterial activities of mikanolide and its derivatives.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The sesquiterpene, mikanolide, was found to possess antibacterial activity. As a result, a structure-activity relationship study was carried out on mikanolide and eleven of its derivatives. METHODS: Mikanolide and two of its derivatives were isolated from organic extract of Mikania micrantha using chromatographic methods. Nine additional derivatives were synthesized and all were investigated for their antibacterial activity against the Gram positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A (BHSA) as well as the Gram negative Escherichia coli using the disk diffusion assay. RESULTS: The investigation revealed that only four of the derivatives displayed antibacterial activity and only pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A were susceptible at a concentration of 100 microg per disk. However there was an increase in activity for three of the derivatives in comparison to mikanolide. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential for phytochemicals from locally available plants to be further investigated and developed as antibacterial agents.
TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is caused by phenol-soluble modulin derivatives.
AB  - Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are causing an ongoing pandemic of mostly skin and soft tissue infections. The success of CA-MRSA as pathogens is due to a combination of antibiotic resistance with high virulence. In addition, it has been speculated that CA-MRSA strains such as the epidemic U.S. clone USA300 have increased capacity to colonize human epithelia, owing to bacteriocin-based bacterial interference. We here analyzed the molecular basis of antimicrobial activity detected in S. aureus strains, including those of the USA300 lineage. In contrast to a previous hypothesis, we found that this activity is not due to expression of a lantibiotic-type bacteriocin, but proteolytically processed derivatives of the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides PSMalpha1 and PSMalpha2. Notably, processed PSMalpha1 and PSMalpha2 exhibited considerable activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, indicating a role of PSMs in the interference of S. aureus strains with the competing colonizing pathogen. Furthermore, by offering a competitive advantage during colonization of the human body, the characteristically high production of PSMs in USA300 and other CA-MRSA strains may thus contribute not only to virulence but also the exceptional capacity of those strains to sustainably spread in the population, which so far has remained poorly understood.
TI  - Prospective randomized evaluation of prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients undergoing tension free inguinal hernioplasty.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis in inguinal hernioplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized double blind study was conducted on 98 patients. Group A (50 patients) received a single dose of intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, and Group P (48 patients) received an equal volume of normal saline placebo by intravenous bolus 30 min before the induction of anesthesia. Hernioplasty was performed with polypropylene mesh. Skin was closed using skin staples that were removed after complete wound healing. The surgical site infection was diagnosed according to APIC, CDC criteria ( http://www.apic.org ). RESULTS: The mean operative time was 38.8 +/- 10.8 min in group A versus 40.9 +/- 11.1 min in group P (P = 0.34). The mean hospitalization time was 1.3 +/- 0.463 days in group A versus 1.25 +/- 0.438 days in group P (P = 0.58). Four patients (2%) in group A and 6 patients (2.88%) in group P had wound infections (P = 0.47). Group A had 3 superficial infections and 1 deep infection while group P had 5 superficial infections and 1 deep infection. Antibiotic treatment of the wound infection was successful in all patients. Wound culture showed Staphylococcus aureus infection in 1 patient each group, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 group A patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 group P patient. Cultures in other patients in both groups were reported to be sterile. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients undergoing tension free inguinal hernioplasty did not show any statistically significant beneficial effects in reduction of surgical site infection.
TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis of small RNAs of major Gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  - In the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new 4''-O-carbamates of 11,12-cyclic carbonate erythromycin A 6,9-imino ether.
AB  - A series of new 4''-O-carbamates of 11,12-cyclic carbonate erythromycin A 6,9-imino ether were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity. All the desired compounds demonstrated favorable activity (0.03 mug ml(-1)) against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae comparable to the references, exhibiting 133-fold higher activity than precursor 2 or 3. Similarly, all of the analogs exhibited improved activity against the erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene and the erm and mef genes, showing 4-32-fold more effectiveness than erythromycin A.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of modithromycin, a novel 6,11-bridged bicyclolide, against respiratory pathogens, including macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of modithromycin against Gram-positive and -negative respiratory pathogens, including macrolide-resistant cocci with different resistance mechanisms, were compared with those of other macrolide and ketolide agents. MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. All 595 test strains used in this study were isolated from Japanese medical facilities. The erm (ribosome methylase) and/or mef (efflux pump) gene, which correlated with resistance to erythromycin as well as clarithromycin and azithromycin, was found in 81.8%, 21.3%, and 23.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, respectively. Modithromycin showed MIC(90)s of 0.125 mug/ml against these three cocci, including macrolide-resistant strains. In particular, the MIC of modithromycin against ermB-carrying S. pyogenes was >/= 32-fold lower than that of telithromycin. The activities of modithromycin as well as telithromycin were little affected by the presence of mefA or mefE in both streptococci. Against Gram-negative pathogens, modithromycin showed MIC(90)s of 0.5, 8, and 0.031 mug/ml against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella spp., respectively. The MICs of modithromycin against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae were higher than those of telithromycin and azithromycin. However, modithromycin showed the most potent anti-Legionella activity among the macrolide and ketolide agents tested. These results suggested that the bicyclolide agent modithromycin is a novel class of macrolides with improved antibacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci, including telithromycin-resistant streptococci and intracellular Gram-negative bacteria of the Legionella species.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of triphenyltinbenzoate.
AB  - Triphenyltinbenzoate was synthesized using triphenyltinchloride and silver benzoate prepared from sodium benzoate. The structure of the synthetic compound was elucidated by spectral and C, H analysis. The antibacterial activities of the organotin compound were determined against four bacteria namely Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pyogenes (clinical isolate) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) in vitro experiment. All the bacteria were inhibited at a concentration of 200 mug/ml and 20 mug/ml in dimethylsulphoxide solution and the minimum inhibitory concentration was found to be same, 7.5 mug/ml for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and 10 mug/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Crystal structures of LacD from Staphylococcus aureus and LacD.1 from Streptococcus pyogenes: insights into substrate specificity and virulence gene regulation.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus LacD, a Class I tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate (TBP) aldolase, shows broadened substrate specificity by catalyzing the cleavage of 1,6-bisphosphate derivatives of D-tagatose, D-fructose, D-sorbose, and D-psicose. LacD.1 and LacD.2 are two closely-related Class I TBP aldolases in Streptococcus pyogenes. Here we have determined the crystal structures of S. aureus LacD and S. pyogenes LacD.1. Monomers of both enzymes are folded into a (beta/alpha)(8) barrel and two monomers associate tightly to form a dimer in the crystals. The structures suggest that the residues E189 and S300 of rabbit muscle Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase are important for substrate specificity. When we mutated the corresponding residues of S. aureus LacD, the mutants (L165E, L275S, and L165E/L275S) showed enhanced substrate specificity toward FBP.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. Recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. The study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely Calcium hydroxide, Zinc oxide eugenol, Vitapex and Metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. METHOD: Microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. The microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using Agar diffusion technique. RESULTS: were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Facultative/Aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and Candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. ZOE showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by Vitapex, Calcium hydroxide and Metapex in descending order. CONCLUSION: Our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. In vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of any of the test filling material.
TI  - Novel bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  - DNA ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in DNA replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. Bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. A novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (HTS), and these compounds were optimized to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of LigA. The adenosine analogs inhibited the LigA activities of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. They were selective for bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against ATP-dependent human DNA ligase 1 or bacteriophage T4 ligase. Enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with NAD+. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the AMP-binding pocket of the LigA adenylation domain. Antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic Gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and M. pneumoniae, as well as against Gram-negative pathogens, such as H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered LigA expression, an Okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with ligA mutations. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine S. aureus thigh infection model and a murine S. pneumoniae lung infection model. Treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in CFU) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating LigA as a target for antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Bacillus spp. of human origin: a potential siderophoregenic probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Bacillus spp. ST13, isolated from human stool, was evaluated for siderophoregenic and probiotic qualities prior to its possible application for iron nutrition in humans and animals. It was tested for siderophore production in iron-limiting conditions and found to produce catecholate type of siderophore on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectra analysis. The isolate was screened for probiotic properties as per WHO and FAO guidelines. The strain ST13 can survive stomach acidity, bile salt and partially simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. It was susceptible to most of the antibiotic tested and showed antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Strain ST13 showed close similarity with Bacillus subtilis using 16S r-RNA gene sequence analysis and biochemical characterization. The methanolic extract of ST13 siderophore was evaluated for DPPH radical scavenging activity, which showed 94.55 +/- 0.9% of radical scavenging effect.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis with fatal outcome: a report of two cases.
AB  - Two cases of sudden and unexpected death due to necrotizing fasciitis are presented with a short overview of this rare disease with special reference to pathological features and causative and epidemiological factors. One case occurred as a complication of liposuction surgery, and the second presented after minor trauma. Based on the autopsy findings and an interdisciplinary approach, medico-legal evaluation provides a substantial basis for later court hearings in such cases.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel clarithromycin derivatives with C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups against macrolide-resistant strains.
AB  - Novel clarithromycin derivatives with C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups were designed, synthesized and evaluated to probe the effect of different lengths of their C-4'' side chains on the activity against resistant bacterial strains. These derivatives had excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes and some of them exhibited greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant strains. Compounds 18 and 16, which had the C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with eight atoms from the 4''-oxygen atom to the terminal benzene ring, were the most effective against S. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene and the erm and mef genes. In contrast, the most potent compounds 3, 5, 9, 17 and 18 against S. pneumoniae expressing the mef gene had C-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with three to eight atoms between the 4''-oxygen atom and the terminal aromatic ring.
TI  - The problem of complicated skin and skin structure infections: the need for new agents.
AB  - Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) continue to pose a significant clinical challenge. The most frequent cause of these infections is Staphylococcus aureus, although other organisms, including Streptococcus pyogenes and, in certain circumstances, Enterobacteriaceae, are also involved. The relentless increase in methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolated in hospitals throughout the world has made it important to provide coverage for these organisms when treating cSSSIs in hospitals. More recently, however, there has been a striking increase in methicillin resistance among staphylococci isolated from infections acquired in the community, particularly in the USA. As a result, previous recommendations for empirical therapy of these important infections are now outdated. The papers in this Supplement detail the properties of a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin that has activity against MRSA and is, thus, an outstanding candidate for empirical therapy of cSSSIs. The papers included provide data on the in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil, which is a welcome addition to our therapeutic armamentarium against cSSSIs.
TI  - 3-[Benzimidazo- and 3-[benzothiadiazoleimidazo-(1,2-c)quinazolin-5-yl]-2H-chromene-2-ones as potent antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of 3-[benzimidazo(1,2-c)quinazolin-5-yl]-2H-chromene-2-one (6a-6f) and 3-[benzothiadiazole- imidazo(1,2-c)quinazolin-5-yl]-2H-chromene-2-one derivatives (7a-7f) that incorporate a variety of substituents at the 6- and/or 8-positions of the coumarin moieties have been synthesized utilizing cellulose sulfuric acid as an efficient catalyst under both conventional heating and microwave irradiation procedures. These analogs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (Gram-positive bacteria), Escherichia Coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhimurium (Gram-negative bacteria), and Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus (Fungi). Two analogs, 6c (a 6,8-dichloro analog, MIC([SA]) = 2.5 mug/mL; MIC([ST]) = 2.5 mug/mL) and 7d (a 6,8-dibromo analog, MIC([ST]) = 2.5 mug/mL) were identified as potent antibacterial agents, and two analogs, 6b (a 6-bromo analog, MIC([AF]) = 10 mug/mL) and 6d (a 6,8-dibromo analog, MIC([AF]) = 15 mug/mL; MIC([CA]) = 15mug/mL), were identified as potent antifungal agents. Based on the MIC data, analogs 6b, 6c, 6d, and 7d were identified as the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series.
TI  - Diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  - Up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or Corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. The interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. This work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. In the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees C for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. There was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer Gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. The number of samples yielding Gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. In the second study, a real-time PCR-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: Corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (NAS, n=32). A mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth samples, on 35% of the samples from which C. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which NAS had been isolated. The most commonly detected major pathogen was Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus uberis, Arcanobacterium pyogenes/Peptoniphilus indolicus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. These results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. However, use of the real-time PCR-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.
TI  - Phytochemical studies on Stemona aphylla: isolation of a new stemofoline alkaloid and six new stemofurans.
AB  - A new stemofoline alkaloid, (2'S)-hydroxy-(11S,12R)-dihydrostemofoline (3), new stemofurans M-R (8-13), and known compounds stemofoline (1), (2'S)-hydroxystemofoline (2), stemofuran E (4), stemofuran F (5), stemofuran J (6), and stilbostemin F (7) have been isolated from the root extracts of Stemona aphylla. The structures and relative configurations of these new compounds have been determined by spectroscopic data interpretation and from semisynthetic studies. These natural and semisynthetic alkaloids were tested for acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities and were found to be 10-20 times less active than 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline itself. Stemofurans 4, 6, 8, 11, and 13 were tested for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Three of these showed antibacterial activities against MRSA with MIC values of 15.6 mug/mL.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Antimycobacterial and antimicrobial study of new 1,2,4-triazoles with benzothiazoles.
AB  - In this study, we report the antimycobacterial and antimicrobial evaluation of newly synthesized 3-(3-pyridyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(N-substituted-1,3-benzothiazol-2-amino)-4H-1 ,2,4-triazole 6a-j in good yields. All the synthesized compounds have been established by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H NMR, (1)(3)C-NMR and Mass spectral data. In-vitro antimycobacterial activity was carried out against (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) H(3)(7)Rv strain using Lowenstein-Jensen medium and antimicrobial activity against two Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes), two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungal species (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus clavatus) using the broth microdilution method. Compounds 2e, 6a, 6g, 6h, and 6j exhibited promising antimicrobial activity whereas compound 6j showed very good antimycobacterial activity.
TI  - Efficacy and safety assessment of a novel ultraviolet C device for treating corneal bacterial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prototype solid-state Ultraviolet-C (UVC) LED device may be useful  in the treatment of corneal microbial infections, as UVC is commonly used for eradicating bacteria, fungi and viruses in other settings. This study assessed the efficacy of 265 nm UVC from this LED, on four different bacterial strains, and investigated the consequences of corresponding exposures on human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS: Agar plate lawns of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to a 4.5 mm diameter 265 nm UVC beam at a fixed intensity and distance, for 30, 5, 4, 2 and 1 seconds. Growth inhibition was assessed with a BioRad Gel imager, and the diameter of lucent areas of bacterial inhibition recorded. Human corneal epithelial cells cultured on glass cover-slips were exposed to corresponding doses of UVC from the same device. Live/dead staining was performed and the results quantified. RESULTS: There was 100% inhibition of growth for all bacteria tested, at all exposure times. A 30-second exposure of human corneal epithelium to UVC gave no statistically significant decrease (P = 0.877) in the ratio of live to dead cells when compared to control cultures. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed that a 1 second exposure to germicidal UVC from this LED source was sufficient to inhibit microbial proliferation in the four bacterial strains tested in vitro. The literature suggests UVC at this dose could potentially be beneficial in treating corneal surface infections, without causing significant adverse effects, supported by our findings in human corneal epithelium exposed to UVC.
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Screening of extracts of algae from Baja California sur, Mexico as reversers of the antibiotic resistance of some pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sixty ethanol extracts of marine flora of Baja California Sur (Mexico) were screened to evaluate the reversing effect of the bacterial resistance to antibiotics in combination with a sublethal concentration of ampicillin or erythromycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity was assayed by using a modification of the classical agar-diffusion method against 3 resistant, pathogenic bacteria; Escherichia coil (ATCC BAA196), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC BAA42), and Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC BAA946). RESULTS: From the 60 ethanolic extracts, 12 (20%) of them in combination with ampicillin were able to reverse the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and 8 (13%) with erythromycin yielded the same reversal with Streptococcus pyogenes. An extract from Sargassum horridum was the only one that reversed the resistance to antibiotics against both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that some algae may be source of compounds with the potential to reverse the antibiotic resistance of some bacteria. In addition, of the assayed extracts, 35 (57%) showed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, 48 (78%) were active against Streptococcus pyogenes, but none was active against Escherichia coil. The most active extracts were from Laurencia spp., Gelidium robustum, Chnoospora implexa, Padina mexicana, Gracilaria subsecundata, and Dictyopteris undulata.
TI  - Molecular analysis improves pathogen identification and epidemiologic study of pediatric parapneumonic empyema.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parapneumonic empyema (PPE) is an increasingly common complication of bacterial pneumonia. Epidemiologic study is complicated by the low frequency of positive cultures. We sought to describe the epidemiology of PPE in children using molecular analysis of pleural fluid. METHODS: We performed molecular testing for bacterial pathogens using archived pleural fluid from children hospitalized in 2009 with PPE. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as PCR-based serotyping of S. pneumoniae was performed. Demographic, laboratory, and microbiologic data were abstracted. RESULTS: Pleural fluid specimens from 63 children were available for PCR. By culture, a pathogen was isolated from blood and/or pleural fluid in 22 (35%) patients, with S. pneumoniae in 15 (24%), S. pyogenes in 3 (5%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 4 (6%). By PCR, a pathogen was detected in 53 (84%), including S. pneumoniae in 45 (71%). Compared with culture, PCR testing significantly increased detection of any pathogen (35% vs. 84%; P < 0.001) and of S. pneumoniae (24% vs. 71%; P < 0.001). Serotype 7F was the most common pneumococcal serotype detected. Comparison of culture-negative to culture-positive disease showed differences in both the pathogen profile and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of pleural fluid more than doubled the detection of pathogens causing PPE. S. pneumoniae was the most common cause of both culture-positive and culture-negative PPE, although serotype distribution and outcomes differed.
TI  - Phytochemical investigations of Stemona curtisii and synthetic studies on stemocurtisine alkaloids.
AB  - The isolation of two new Stemona alkaloids, 1-hydroxyprotostemonine and stemocurtisine N-oxide, and a new benzofuran, stemofuran L, from the root extracts of Stemona curtisii is reported. The major known alkaloids from this plant extract, stemocurtisine, stemocurtisinol, and oxyprotostemonine, were also isolated along with oxystemokerrine N-oxide. The nonalkaloid components of this extract included a new benzofuran derivative, stemofuran L, the known stemofurans F, J, and K, dihydro-gamma-tocopherol, and stigmasterol. Stemocurtisine and stemocurtisinol were converted to their respective N-oxides by oxidation. Stemocurtisine was converted to a tetracyclic derivative by oxidative cleavage of the gamma-butyrolactone ring, while stemocurtisinol gave a novel lactam derivative by oxidative cleavage of the C-4 side chain under basic conditions. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of some known and new alkaloids and their derivatives are also reported. All were 10-20 times less active as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine Stemona alkaloids stemofoline and 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline. None of the stemofuran compounds showed significant antibacterial or antifungal activities.
TI  - Superantigen-induced proliferation of human CD4+CD25- T cells is followed by a switch to a functional regulatory phenotype.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens are potent T cell activators. In humans they cause toxic  shock and scarlet fever, and they are implicated in Kawasaki's disease, autoimmunity, atopy, and sepsis. Their function remains unknown, but it may be to impair host immune responses increasing bacterial carriage and transmission. Regulatory (CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) T cells (Tregs) play a role in controlling inflammatory responses to infection. Approximately 2% of circulating T cells are naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs). Conventional Ag stimulation of naive FOXP3(-) T cells induces Ag-specific Tregs. Polyclonal T cell activation has been shown to produce non-Ag-specific Tregs. Because superantigens are unique among microbial virulence factors in their ability to trigger polyclonal T cell activation, we wanted to determine whether superantigen stimulation of T cells could induce non-Ag-specific Tregs. We assessed the effect of superantigen stimulation of human T cells on activation, regulatory markers, and cytokine production by flow cytometry and T cell suppression assays. Stimulation of PBMCs with staphylococcal exotoxin A and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L resulted in dose-dependent FOXP3 expression. Characterization of this response for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin K/L confirmed its Vbeta specificity, that CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells arose from CD25(-) T cells and required APCs. These cells had increased CTLA-4 and CD127 expression, typical of the recently described activated converted Treg-like cells, and exhibited functional suppressor activity comparable to nTregs. Superantigen-stimulated CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T cells expressed IL-10 at lower superantigen concentrations than was required to trigger IFN-gamma production. This study provides a mechanism for bacterial evasion of the immune response through the superantigen induction of Tregs.
TI  - Identification and characterization of anti-microbial peptides from rabbit vaginal fluid.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) serve as a first line of host defense and represent an important, though poorly understood components of the innate immune system. The present study was an attempt to identify and characterize the major molecules having anti-bacterial activities from the vaginal fluid of rabbit, Oryctologus cuniculus. AMPs from the rabbit vaginal fluid (RVF) were identified in the acid extracts of pooled RVF samples after RP-HPLC purification. The protein, RVFAMP was effective against gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. The results of acid urea-PAGE-gel overlay assay (AU-PAGE-GOA) demonstrated clear zone of growth inhibition of E. coli corresponding to 6 and 15 kDa protein bands. LC-MS data of these proteins indicated that 15 kDa protein consists of lysozyme, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), hemoglobin-alpha and beta subunits (Hb-alpha/beta), whereas 9 kDa protein band consists of transthyretin and calcyclin while uteroglobulin and neutrophil antibacterial peptide-5 (NAMP-5) are present in the 6 kDa protein band. Of the eight proteins, Hb-alpha derived protein was further characterized, as it showed the highest Probability Based Mowse Score (PBMS) of 288. A 25mer peptide, RVFHbalphap was active against several clinical pathogens as demonstrated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and radial diffusion assays (RDA). The interaction of RVFHbalphaP with bacterial liposome membrane was assessed by calcein dye leakage assay. RVFHbalphaP did not show cytotoxicity against human endocervical cells (End1/E6E7) or erythrocytes. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence results revealed the expression of RVFHbalphaP mRNA and protein in rabbit vaginal tissue. To the best our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of AMPs in RVFs. In conclusion, these studies indicated that vaginal epithelial cells (VEC) derived RVFHbalphaP may have therapeutic potential in the management of reproductive well being of rabbits. The major reason for undertaking this study in rabbits is that, it forms an excellent in vivo model system for human's studies.
TI  - [Modification of antibiotic resistance in microbial symbiosis].
AB  - In antibiotic therapy it is necessary to use drugs active against the pathogen in its association with the host normal microflora. The aim of the study was to investigate modification of antibiotic resistance under conditions of the pathogen association with the representatives of the host normal microflora and to develop the microbiological criteria for determining effectiveness of antibacterials. Modification of microbial antibiotic resistance was investigated in 408 associations. Various changes in the antibiotic resistance of the strains were revealed: synergism, antagonism and indifference. On the basis of the results it was concluded that in the choice of the antibiotic active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes the preference should be given to oxacillin, gentamicin and levomycetin, since the resistance of the pathogens to these antibiotics under the association conditions did not increase, which could contribute to their destruction, whereas the resistance of the normoflora increased or did not change, which was important for its retention in the biocenosis. The data on changeability of the antibiotic resistance of the microbial strains under the association conditions made it possible to develop microbiological criteria for determining effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of inflammatory diseases of microbial etiology (RF Patent No. 2231554).
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Solvent-free microwave extraction and hydrodistillation of essential oils from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran: comparison of antibacterial activity and contents.
AB  - The essential oils (EOs) obtained by solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and hydrodistillation (HD) from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran were investigated using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The main constituents of both oils obtained from SFME and HD from O. husnucanbaseri are borneol (15.2-12.8%), alpha-terpineol (12.3-10.8%) and trans-sabinene hydrate (11.8-9.92%). The EO obtained from SFME contained substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes than that from HD. The antibacterial activities of the EOs from SFME and HD were evaluated by the disc diffusion method against six bacterial strains. The EO extracted by SFME was more effective than the EO extracted by HD against the tested bacteria, except for Klebsiella pneumoniae American type culture collection (ATCC) 13883. Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in particular were more sensitive against the EO extracted by SFME.
TI  - Synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  - Maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. This study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for Staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for Streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for Enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin for Enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. A range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. The results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on S. aureus. Minimal concentrations and MBC of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. The MBC of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against S. aureus were also decreased. The other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. Excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. The synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.
TI  - Retapamulin: an antibacterial with a novel mode of action in an age of emerging resistance to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-bacterial activities of some novel Schiff bases derived from aminophenazone.
AB  - A series of 1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one-containing Schiff  bases were synthesized, characterized and screened for their antibacterial activities. The structures of the synthesized compounds were established by spectroscopic (FT-IR, (1)H-NMR, (1)(3)C-NMR, MS) and elemental analyses. The anti-bacterial activities (with MIC values) of compounds were evaluated. The anti-bacterial screening results reveal that among the six compounds screened, four compounds showed moderate to good anti-bacterial activity. Among the tested compounds, the most effective compounds against four bacterial strains, viz. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pyogenes, are [(2-chlorobenzylidene)amino]-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3-one (4) and [(1,5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-ylimino)methyl]benzonitril e (5) with MIC values of 6.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Characterization of a Staphylococcus aureus surface virulence factor that promotes resistance to oxidative killing and infectious endocarditis.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent human pathogen and a leading cause of community- and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of the S. aureus 67.6-kDa hypothetical protein, named for the surface factor promoting resistance to oxidative killing (SOK) in this study. Sequence analysis showed that the SOK gene is conserved in all sequenced S. aureus strains and homologous to the myosin cross-reactive antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that SOK was copurified with membrane fractions and was exposed on the surface of S. aureus Newman and RN4220. Comparative analysis of wild-type S. aureus and an isogenic deletion strain indicated that SOK contributes to both resistance to killing by human neutrophils and to oxidative stress. In addition, the S. aureus sok deletion strain showed dramatically reduced aortic valve vegetation and bacterial cell number in a rabbit endocarditis model. These results, plus the suspected role of the streptococcal homologue in certain diseases such as acute rheumatic fever, suggest that SOK plays an important role in cardiovascular and other staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Effective photoinactivation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains  using an HIV-1 Tat peptide-porphyrin conjugate.
AB  - Given that cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are cationic and often amphipathic, similar to membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, it may be possible to use CPP conjugation to improve the delivery of photosensitisers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (antimicrobial PDT). We investigated the possibility of using a Tat peptide to deliver the photosensitiser, tetrakis(phenyl)porphyrin (TPP) and kill bacteria. The Tat peptide is a positively-charged mammalian cell-penetrating peptide with potent antimicrobial activity but no haemolytic activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the bioconjugate can bind to and/or be incorporated into all bacterial species tested. All species were susceptible to the Tat-porphyrin, with the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration and the light dose. Using the highest light dose, treatment with the Tat-porphyrin achieved reductions of 6.6 log(10) and 6.37 log(10) in the viable counts of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and reductions of 5.74 log(10) and 6.6 log(10) in the viable counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the Tat moiety appears to confer antimicrobial properties to the conjugate, particularly for the Gram positive strains, based on the observation of dark toxicity using 1 muM of Tat-porphyrin. Finally, the conjugate induced membrane destabilization by synergistic action of the peptide and PDT, resulting in carboxyfluorescein leakage from bacterial membrane-mimicking liposomes. These findings demonstrate that the use of CPP to deliver a photosensitiser is an effective way of improving the uptake and the treatment efficacy of antimicrobial PDT.
TI  - A single, engineered protein therapeutic agent neutralizes exotoxins from both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes secrete exotoxins that act as superantigens, proteins that cause hyperimmune reactions by binding the variable domain of the T-cell receptor beta chain (Vbeta), leading to stimulation of a large fraction of the T-cell repertoire. To develop potential neutralizing agents, we engineered Vbeta mutants with high affinity for the superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), SEC3, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA). Unexpectedly, the high-affinity Vbeta mutants generated against SEB cross-reacted with SpeA to a greater extent than they did with SEC3, despite greater sequence similarity between SEB and SEC3. Likewise, the Vbeta mutants generated against SpeA cross-reacted with SEB to a greater extent than with SEC3. The structural basis of the high affinity and cross-reactivity was examined by single-site mutational analyses. The cross-reactivity seems to involve only one or two toxin residues. Soluble forms of the cross-reactive Vbeta regions neutralized both SEB and SpeA in vivo, suggesting structure-based strategies for generating high-affinity neutralizing agents that can cross-react with multiple exotoxins.
TI  - The pathogenesis of infection and immune response.
AB  - An understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and the complex and fascinating 'relationship', or interaction, between the infecting organism and the host are advantageous when caring for patients with infections/infectious diseases, particularly as many of the clinical features of infection are as a consequence of the defence mechanisms mounted by the immune system. This article aims to provide a brief overview of the pathogenesis of infection, explaining how the two branches of the immune system, the innate/natural immune response, and the adaptive/acquired immune response, mount an attack against invading bacteria. Reference is made to bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and their effect on the human host and the immune response, through the processes of attachment/entry, evasion of host defences, replication, and damage to the host.
TI  - Intrinsic nitric oxide-stimulatory activity of lipoteichoic acids from different  Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a structural component of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. Similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is expressed in Gram-negative bacteria, LTA exhibits immunostimulatory properties. Frequently observed positive response of LTA in the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay has been interpreted as a sign of LPS contamination, raising doubts about the intrinsic immune activities of LTA. Regarding many similarities in immunobiological and physicochemical properties of LTA and LPS, we hypothesized that similar to LPS, the LAL reactivity of LTA might be due to its ability to bind to LAL. Our data confirm the positivity of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes LTAs in the LAL test. The estimates of suspected LPS content were 605, 10.3, 6.2 and 127 pg/mug LTA, respectively. The effectiveness of LTAs to induce the NO production in rat peritoneal cells was remarkably higher than that of equivalent concentrations of reference LPS (Escherichia coli). The LPS-induced NO was inhibited by polymyxin B (PMX), the IC(50) of PMX:LPS concentration ratio (pg:pg) being 1050:1. Many fold higher concentrations of PMX were needed to partially suppress the NO-augmenting effects of LTAs, applied at concentrations representing the equivalents of LPS. Transposed to the concentrations of LTAs per se, the IC(50)s of the PMX:LTA ratios (mug:mug) ranged from 0.3:1 (S. aureus) to 7.5:1 (B. subtilis). It is concluded that LTA is not necessarily contaminated with LPS. The results prove the intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of LTAs of Gram-positive bacteria. The positive response of LTA in the LAL assay results from its capacity to bind to LAL. In addition, LTA binds with high affinity to PMX.
TI  - The streptococcal binding site in the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin is consistent with a non-linear arrangement of modules.
AB  - Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes mediate invasion of human endothelial and epithelial cells in a process likely to aid the persistence and/or dissemination of infection. In addition to binding sites for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of fibronectin (Fn), a number of streptococcal FnBPs also contain an upstream region (UR) that is closely associated with an NTD-binding region; UR binds to the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of Fn. Previously, UR was shown to be required for efficient streptococcal invasion of epithelial cells. Here we show, using a Streptococcus zooepidemicus FnBP, that the UR-binding site in GBD resides largely in the (8)F1(9)F1 module pair. We also show that UR inhibits binding of a peptide from the alpha1 chain of type I collagen to (8)F1(9)F1 and that UR binding to (8)F1 is likely to occur through anti-parallel beta-zipper formation. Thus, we propose that streptococcal proteins that contain adjacent NTD- and GBD-binding sites form a highly unusual extended tandem beta-zipper that spans the two domains and mediates high affinity binding to Fn through a large intermolecular interface. The proximity of the UR- and NTD-binding sequences in streptococcal FnBPs is consistent with a non-linear arrangement of modules in the tertiary structure of the GBD of Fn.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - Design, synthesis and in vitro evaluation of antitubercular and antimicrobial activity of some novel pyranopyrimidines.
AB  - The clinical significance of pyran and pyrimidine condensed systems and the raise in problem of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize pyranopyrimidine derivatives via the reactions of the versatile, 2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-substituted chromene-3-carbonitrile with the appropriate reagents. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectra and Elemental analysis. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv [ATCC-27294] and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus [ATCC-25923] and Streptococcus pyogenes [MTCC-443] as gram-positive, Escherichia coli [ATCC-25922] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [MTCC-441] as gram-negative bacterial strains and antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger [MTCC-282]. Several derivatives exhibited pronounced antitubercular and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives.
AB  - Novel 4''-O-carbamoyl erythromycin-A derivatives were designed, synthesized, and  evaluated for their in-vitro antibacterial activities. All of the 4''-O-carbamoyl derivatives showed excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC49619. Most of the 4''-O-arylalkylcarbamoyl derivatives displayed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene or the erm and mef genes. In particular, the 4''-O-arylalkyl derivatives 4c-4e and 4g were found to possess the most potent activity against all the tested erythromycin-susceptible strains, which were comparable to those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4e and 4g were the most effective against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene (0.25 and 0.25 microg/mL). 4''-O-Arylalkyl derivatives 4a and 4b exhibited significantly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. In contrast, the 4''-O-alkylcarbamoyl derivatives hardly showed improved activity against all the tested erythromycin-resistant strains.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Biological activity of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata (Schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. METHODS: The essential oil from stem bark of Kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. Inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MIA PaCa-2, HeLa, HL-60, MDA-MB-231 and SW-480) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-Cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. The oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/ml oil. The essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but it did not show any activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma b. brucei with an IC50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. Radical scavenging activity had an IC50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-Lipoxygenase inhibition (IC50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin E(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. The oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against MIA PaCa-2, HepG-2 and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. The oil increased caspase 3/7 activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in MIA Paca-2 cells. Camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. However, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, K. longipedunculata, a traditionally used Chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.
TI  - Serious infectious complications related to extremity cast/splint placement in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extremity injuries necessitating splinting or casting are commonly seen in the emergency department (ED) setting. Subsequently, it is not uncommon for patients to present to the ED with complaints related to an extremity cast or splint. OBJECTIVE: To present a literature-based approach to the identification and initial management of patients with possible infectious cast/splint complications in the ED setting. CASE REPORTS: We present two cases of serious infectious complications arising from extremity cast/splint placement seen in a single pediatric ED: a case of toxic shock syndrome in an 8-year-old child, and a case of necrotizing fasciitis resulting in upper extremity amputation in a 3-year-old child. CONCLUSIONS/SUMMARY: A wide spectrum of potential extremity cast/splint infectious complications may be seen, which include limb- or life-threatening infections such as toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis. Simply considering these diagnoses, and removing the cast or splint to carefully inspect the affected extremity, are potential keys to early identification and optimal outcome of cast/splint complications. It is also prudent to maintain particular vigilance when treating a patient with a water-exposed cast, which may lead to moist padding, skin breakdown, and potential infection. In patients with suspected serious infections, aggressive fluid management and antibiotic therapy should be initiated and appropriate surgical consultation obtained without delay.
TI  - The development of antimicrobial resistance due to the antibiotic treatment of acne vulgaris: a review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance. DATA SOURCES: Sources for this article were identified by searching the English literature by Medline for the period 1960 to March 2009. STUDY SELECTION: The following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection. DATA SYNTHESIS: Both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. The development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids. CONCLUSION: Long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. These findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.
TI  - 99mTc-Human beta-defensin-3
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi (1). The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins, and theta-defensins. Mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human beta-defensins (human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3) and human beta-defensin-4 (HBD-4)) have been identified. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity toward the Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and yeasts. In addition, HBD-3 kills Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant S. aureus strains. In contrast to HBD-1 and HBD-2, significant expression of HBD-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues such as leukocytes, heart, and skeletal muscle. HBD-4 is expressed in certain epithelial cells and in neutrophils. A variety of radiolabeled compounds, including 67Ga-citrate, 99mTc-ciprofloxacin, 18F-FDG, and 111In- or 99mTc-labeled antibodies that interact with specific receptors on the infiltrating leukocytes, and peptides have been evaluated for the detection of infections (2, 3). However, because they accumulate in both infected and inflamed areas of the body, these radiopharmaceuticals are nonspecific and cannot distinguish between infection and inflammation. In an effort to identify and develop radioactive compounds that are specific for the detection of infections, various investigators have evaluated the use of antimicrobial peptides that are found naturally in most multicellular organisms (4). Such peptides bind specifically to microbes, presumably through cationic domains that interact with anionic regions of the microbial membrane, and have been shown to distinguish infected tissue from inflamed tissue (5). Liberatore et al. (6) radiolabeled HBD-3 with 99mTc for single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of infected tissue.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes Ser/Thr kinase-regulated cell wall hydrolase is a cell division plane-recognizing and chain-forming virulence factor.
AB  - Cell division and cell wall synthesis are closely linked complex phenomena and play a crucial role in the maintenance and regulation of bacterial virulence. Eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr kinases reported in prokaryotes, including that in group A Streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes Ser/Thr kinase (SP-STK)), regulate cell division, growth, and virulence. The mechanism of this regulation is, however, unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that SP-STK-controlled cell division is mediated under the positive regulation of secretory protein that possesses a cysteine and histidine-dependent aminohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) domain with functionally active cell wall hydrolase activity (henceforth named as CdhA (CHAP-domain-containing and chain-forming cell wall hydrolase). Deletion of the CdhA-encoding gene resulted in severe cell division and growth defects in GAS mutants. The mutant expressing the truncated CdhA (devoid of the CHAP domain), although displayed no such defects, it became attenuated for virulence in mice and highly susceptible to cell wall-acting antibiotics, as observed for the mutant lacking CdhA. When CdhA was overexpressed in the wild-type GAS as well as in heterologous strains, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, we observed a distinct increase in bacterial chain length. Our data reveal that CdhA is a multifunctional protein with a major function of the N-terminal region as a cell division plane-recognizing domain and that of the C-terminal CHAP domain as a virulence-regulating domain. CdhA is thus an important therapeutic target.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a new brominated diterpene from Borneon Laurencia spp.
AB  - In our continuous interest to study the diversity of halogenated metabolites of Malaysian species of the red algal genus Laurencia, we examined the chemical composition of five populations of unrecorded Laurencia sp. A new brominated diterpene, 10-acetoxyangasiol (1), and four other known metabolites, aplysidiol (2), cupalaurenol (3), 1-methyl-2,3,5-tribromoindole (4), and chamigrane epoxide (5), were isolated and identified. Isolated metabolites exhibited potent antibacterial activities against clinical bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella sp. and Vibrio cholerae.
TI  - Structural, spectral and biological studies of binuclear tetradentate metal complexes of N3O Schiff base ligand synthesized from 4,6-diacetylresorcinol and diethylenetriamine.
AB  - The binuclear Schiff base, H2L, ligand was synthesized by reaction of 4,6-diacetylresorcinol with diethylenetriamine in the molar ratio 1:2. The coordination behavior of the H2L towards Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II), Zn(II), Fe(III), Cr(III), VO(IV) and UO2(VI) ions has been investigated. The elemental analyses, magnetic moments, thermal studies and IR, electronic, 1H NMR, ESR and mass spectra were used to characterize the isolated ligand and its metal complexes. The ligand acts as dibasic with two N3O-tetradentate sites and can coordinate with two metal ions to form binuclear complexes. The bonding sites are the nitrogen atoms of the azomethine and amine groups and the oxygen atoms of the phenolic groups. The metal complexes exhibit either square planar, tetrahedral, square pyramid or octahedral structures. The Schiff base ligand and its metal complexes were tested against four pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) as Gram-positive bacteria, and (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas phaseolicola) as Gram-negative bacteria and two pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus fumigatus) to assess their antimicrobial properties. Most of the complexes exhibit mild antibacterial and antifungal activities against these organisms.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical profile of Community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as defined by British Thoracic society, from December 1998 to Dec 2000, at the Sher- i-Kashmir institute of Medical Sciences Soura, Srinagar, India. Gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). In 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7/29), Escherichia coli (6/29), Klebsiella spp. (3/29), Streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and Acinetobacter spp. (1/29). Sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). Maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). The commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), COPD (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). Fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, Pseudomonas in two, Klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. The factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of COPD or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. The overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. This emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for Legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of CAP.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new thiazole, thiophene and pyrazole derivatives containing benzothiazole moiety.
AB  - In an attempt to find a new class of antimicrobial agents, a series of thiazole,  thiophene, pyrazole and other related products containing benzothiazole moiety were prepared via the reaction of N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-cyanoacetamide (1) with appropriate chemical reagents. These compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas phaseolicola and Pseudomonas fluorescens) and antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus fumigatus. Among the synthesized compounds, thiophene 13 showed equal activity with chloroamphenicol against S. aureus (MIC 3.125 microg/mL), while its activity was 50% lower than of chloroamphenicol against S. pyogenes. Thiazole 3 and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 21 b were found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antifungal activity with MICs (6.25 microg/mL) against A. fumigatus and F. oxysporum. Structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established by elemental analysis and spectral data.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - A novel approach to the antimicrobial activity of maggot debridement therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Commercially produced sterile green bottle fly Lucilia sericata maggots are successfully employed by practitioners worldwide to clean a multitude of chronic necrotic wounds and reduce wound bacterial burdens during maggot debridement therapy (MDT). Secretions from the maggots exhibit antimicrobial activity along with other activities beneficial for wound healing. With the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, new approaches to identifying the active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity within this treatment are imperative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel approach to investigate the output of secreted proteins from the maggots under conditions mimicking clinical treatments. METHODS: cDNA libraries constructed from microdissected salivary glands and whole maggots, respectively, were treated with transposon-assisted signal trapping (TAST), a technique selecting for the identification of secreted proteins. Several putative secreted components of insect immunity were identified, including a defensin named lucifensin, which was produced recombinantly as a Trx-fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, and tested in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. RESULTS: Lucifensin was active against Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC 2 mg/L), as well as Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 16 mg/L). The peptide did not show antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of lucifensin for the methicillin-resistant S. aureus and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus isolates tested ranged from 8 to >128 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The TAST results did not reveal any highly secreted compounds with putative antimicrobial activity, implying an alternative antimicrobial activity of MDT. Lucifensin showed antimicrobial activities comparable to other defensins and could have potential as a future drug candidate scaffold, for redesign for other applications besides the topical treatment of infected wounds.
TI  - [Salmonella bredney: a rare cause of mycotic aneurysm].
AB  - Mycotic aneurysms are rare, remain asymptomatic for a long time, and may be life  threatening by their rupture if therapy is delayed. Historically associated with Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, they now frequently involve Salmonella species in elderly or immunodeficient patients, and complicate vascular investigation or surgical procedures. Frequently located in the abdominal aorta, they can also be found rarely in other location. Therapy associates antibiotics and surgical debridement with reestablishment of vascular continuity. We report a case of ruptured popliteal aneurysm with Salmonella bredney bacteraemia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. Corticosteroid formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. The hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. Clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on C. albicans. In contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. Fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against S. pyogenes and no activity against C. albicans or E. coli. In summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. In limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. With the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.
TI  - [Two cases of psoas abscesses caused by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection with a cutaneous portal of entry].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rare clinical entity that occurs chiefly after intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal infection. We report two cases of psoas abscesses caused by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection having a cutaneous portal of entry. CASE REPORTS: The first patient, a 50-year-old man, was feverish and had ulcerative and necrotic cutaneous lesions evocative of ecthyma that were progressing for three months and were recently associated with a painful mass in the left iliac fossa, leading to difficulties in walking. The second patient, a 35-year-old woman with a medical history of intravenous drug addiction, was admitted to intensive care for sepsis syndrome following group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection with a cutaneous portal of entry (swelling on left lower limb). She remained unaccountably subfebrile 10 days after the start of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin. Abdominal CAT scans for each patient confirmed the diagnosis of left psoas abscess. For the first patient, the same group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus was isolated in drainage fluid and at the cutaneous injury site. The outcome was favourable in both cases following extensive intravenous antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) combined with percutaneous drainage (in the first case). DISCUSSION: Psoas abscess can occur after locoregional infection and the portals of entry are usually gastro-intestinal, musculoskeletal or genitourinary, with many organisms capable of causing such secondary abscesses. Psoas abscess can also be a primary clinical event. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. The presented cases comprised secondary psoas abscesses with a cutaneous portal of entry. Since the complete set of three evocative symptoms (prolonged fever, pain and psoitis) is frequently seen late, diagnosis must be made on the basis of prolonged infectious state or unaccountable feverish abdominal pain. Diagnosis is based on abdominal CAT scan and treatment involves the use of appropriate antibiotics as well as percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess. The mortality rate in this patient population remains high with survival being dependent on prompt initiation of therapy.
TI  - Activation of TLR2 by a small molecule produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis increases antimicrobial defense against bacterial skin infections.
AB  - Production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelia is an essential defense against infectious pathogens. In this study we evaluated whether the commensal microorganism Staphylococcus epidermidis may enhance production of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes and thus augment skin defense against infection. Exposure of cultured undifferentiated human keratinocytes to a sterile nontoxic small molecule of <10 kDa from S. epidermidis conditioned culture medium (SECM), but not similar preparations from other bacteria, enhanced human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) and hBD3 mRNA expression and increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit the growth of group A Streptococcus (GAS) and S. aureus. Partial gene silencing of hBD3 inhibited this antimicrobial action. This effect was relevant in vivo as administration of SECM to mice decreased susceptibility to infection by GAS. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was important to this process as a TLR2-neutralizing antibody blocked induction of hBDs 2 and 3, and Tlr2-deficient mice did not show induction of mBD4. Taken together, these findings reveal a potential use for normal commensal bacterium S. epidermidis to activate TLR2 signaling and induce antimicrobial peptide expression, thus enabling the skin to mount an enhanced response to pathogens.
TI  - Antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of Walsura robusta Roxb.
AB  - Walsura robusta Roxb. (Family: Meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. In the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside A (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of W. robusta. Biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and antigiardial activities was performed. We investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide anion (O(2)) scavenging assays. Three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. They scavenged DPPH(*) with IC(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microM. We also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with IC(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively. Other biological activities including antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. Preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and S. pyogenes. Aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. However, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of W. robusta on all tested bacterial strains showed only weak activity, and their MBCs were greater than 25 mg mL(-1). For antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites mL(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg mL(-1) demonstrated no activity (MIC > 1000 microg mL(-1)).
TI  - Use of natural antimicrobials to increase antibiotic susceptibility of drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Plant-derived antibacterial compounds may be of value as a novel means for controlling antibiotic resistant zoonotic pathogens which contaminate food animals and their products. Individual activity of natural antimicrobials (eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate (AIT)) and activity when paired with an antibiotic was studied using broth microdilution and checkerboard methods. In the latter assays, fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values were calculated to characterize interactions between the inhibitors. Bacteria tested were chosen because of their resistance to at least one antibiotic which had a known genetic basis. Substantial susceptibility of these bacteria toward the natural antimicrobials and a considerable reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of the antibiotics were noted when paired combinations of antimicrobial and antibiotic were used. In the interaction study, thymol and carvacrol were found to be highly effective in reducing the resistance of Salmonella Typhimurium SGI 1 (tet A) to ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, bacitracin, erythromycin and novobiocin (FIC<0.4) and resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes ermB to erythromycin (FIC<0.5). With Escherichia coli N00 666, thymol and cinnamaldehyde were found to have a similar effect (FIC<0.4) in reducing the MIC's of ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, erythromycin and novobiocin. Carvacrol, thymol (FIC<0.3) and cinnamaldehyde (FIC<0.4) were effective against Staphylococcus aureus blaZ and in reducing the MIC's of ampicillin, penicillin and bacitracin. Allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) was effective in reducing the MIC of erythromycin (FIC<0.3) when tested against S. pyogenes. Fewer combinations were found to be synergistic when the decrease in viable population (log DP) was calculated. Together, fractional inhibitory concentrations < or = 0.5 and log DP<-1 indicated synergistic action between four natural antimicrobials and as many as three antibiotics to which these bacteria were normally resistant.
TI  - Bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Titania dioxide (TiO(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Visible-light responsive anion-doped TiO(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. The antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated TiO(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. Among our tested titania substrates including TiO(2), carbon-doped TiO(2) [TiO(2) (C)] and nitrogen-doped TiO(2) [TiO(2) (N)], TiO(2) (N) showed the best performance after silver coating. The synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on TiO(2) (N) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could further influence the bactericidal property.
TI  - Small variable segments constitute a major type of diversity of bacterial genomes at the species level.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of large scale diversity in bacterial genomes has mainly focused on elements such as pathogenicity islands, or more generally, genomic islands. These comprise numerous genes and confer important phenotypes, which are present or absent depending on strains. We report that despite this widely accepted notion, most diversity at the species level is composed of much smaller DNA segments, 20 to 500 bp in size, which we call microdiversity. RESULTS: We performed a systematic analysis of the variable segments detected by multiple whole genome alignments at the DNA level on three species for which the greatest number of genomes have been sequenced: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Among the numerous sites of variability, 62 to 73% were loci of microdiversity, many of which were located within genes. They contribute to phenotypic variations, as 3 to 6% of all genes harbor microdiversity, and 1 to 9% of total genes are located downstream from a microdiversity locus. Microdiversity loci are particularly abundant in genes encoding membrane proteins. In-depth analysis of the E. coli alignments shows that most of the diversity does not correspond to known mobile or repeated elements, and it is likely that they were generated by illegitimate recombination. An intriguing class of microdiversity includes small blocks of highly diverged sequences, whose origin is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis uncovers the importance of this small-sized genome diversity, which we expect to be present in a wide range of bacteria, and possibly also in many eukaryotic genomes.
TI  - Trimethopim-sulfamethoxazole compared with benzathine penicillin for treatment of impetigo in Aboriginal children: a pilot randomised controlled trial.
AB  - We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to benzathine penicillin for treatment of impetigo in Aboriginal children. Treatment was successful in 7 of 7 children treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 5 of 6 treated with benzathine penicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole achieved microbiological clearance and healing of sores from which beta-hemolytic streptococci and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were initially cultured.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Co-spray-dried mannitol-ciprofloxacin dry powder inhaler formulation for cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination therapy, containing mannitol (a sugar alcohol with osmotic characteristics), and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (an antibacterial fluoroquinolone), as a dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation for inhalation. Single and combination powders were produced by spray drying ciprofloxacin and mannitol, from aqueous solution, at different ratios and under controlled conditions, as to obtain similar particle size distributions. Each formulation was characterised using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, X-ray powder diffraction, and colloidal force microscopy. The in vitro aerosol performance of each formulation was studied using an Aerolizer DPI device and a multi-stage liquid impinger (analysed using high performance liquid chromatography). In addition, a disk diffusion test was performed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of each formulation and starting materials. All formulations had similar particle size distributions, however, the morphology, thermal properties and moisture sorption was dependent on the relative percentages of each component. In general, the combination formulation containing 50% (w/w) mannitol appeared to have the best aerosol performance, good stability and lowest particle cohesion (as measured by colloid probe microscopy). Furthermore, of the formulations tested, mannitol did not appear to alter the effectiveness of the ciprofloxacin antimicrobial activity to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyogenes. The combination of co-spray-dried mannitol and ciprofloxacin from a DPI is an attractive approach to promote mucous clearance in the respiratory tract while simultaneously treating local chronic infection, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Impetigo update: new challenges in the era of methicillin resistance.
AB  - Impetigo is a bacterial infection of the superficial epidermis most commonly seen in infants and children. It is clinically characterized by crusted erosions or ulcers that may arise as a primary infection in which bacterial invasion occurs through minor breaks in the cutaneous surface or a secondary infection of a preexisting dermatosis or infestation. Impetigo occurs in 2 forms: bullous and nonbullous. Staphylococcus aureus currently is the most common overall cause of impetigo, but Streptococcus pyogenes remains an important cause in developing nations. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus (CA-MRSA) poses a challenge because of its enhanced virulence and increasing prevalence in children. For limited uncomplicated impetigo, either topical mupirocin or fusidic acid is as effective if not more effective than systemic antibiotics. For extensive or complicated impetigo, systemic antibiotics may be warranted, but beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided if methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) is suspected.
TI  - Evaluation of alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes considering that most of the previously proposed methods are expensive and cannot be easily implemented. Two-hundred toothbrushes with standardized dimensions and bristles were included in the study. The toothbrushes were divided into 20 experimental groups (n = 10), according to microorganism considered and chemical agent used. The toothbrushes were contaminated in vitro by standardized suspensions of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans. The following disinfectants were tested: 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% white vinegar, a triclosan-containing dentifrice solution, and a perborate-based tablet solution. The disinfection method was immersion in the disinfectant for 10 min. After the disinfection procedure, the number of remaining microbial cells was evaluated. The values of cfu/toothbrush of each group of microorganism after disinfection were compared by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test for multiple comparisons (5%). The chlorhexidine digluconate solution was the most effective disinfectant. The triclosan-based dentifrice solution promoted a significant reduction of all microorganisms' counts in relation to the control group. As to the disinfection with 50% vinegar, a significant reduction was observed for all the microorganisms, except for C. albicans. The sodium perborate solution was the less effective against the tested microorganisms. Solutions based on triclosan-containing dentifrice may be considered effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and an easily applicable alternative for the disinfection of toothbrushes. The vinegar solution reduced the presence of S. aureus, S. mutans and S. pyogenes on toothbrushes.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine derivatives as  antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized to determine their antibacterial and antifungal activities as well as possible structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve therapeutic efficacy. The pyrazol-5-amine benzamides were screened for their antibacterial activity against standard strains of Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes NCIM 2608, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29737, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2010) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 20852, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 618) bacteria by using streptomycin as positive control. They were also tested for their antifungal activities against mycotoxic strains of Fusarium verticillioides, Aspergillus ochraceous, Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, and Penicillium chrysogenum using nystatin as positive control. Among the synthesized compounds, 9d, 9g, and 9h showed potent antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive non-urinary isolates to fosfomycin.
AB  - We aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against Gram-positive non-urinary isolates collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, in 2008. Susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method for a total of 1846 isolates; 1275 isolates (69.1%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, 416/419 Staphylococcus aureus (99.3%) [including 129/130 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates] and 745/961 coagulase-negative staphylococci (77.5%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Among 42 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 64 Streptococcus pyogenes and 93 other streptococcal isolates, 61.9%, 40.6% and 48.4%, respectively, were susceptible to fosfomycin. Fosfomycin was inactive against the 166 enterococcal isolates tested. This old antibiotic may deserve consideration for further studies and use in clinical practice, especially for S. aureus (including MRSA) infections.
TI  - Intracellular persisting Staphylococcus aureus is the major pathogen in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The two major indications for tonsillectomy are recurrent tonsillitis (RT) and peritonsillar abscess (PTA). Unlike PTAs, which are primarily treated surgically, RT is often cured by tonsillectomy only after a series of failed drug therapy attempts. Although the bacteriological background of RT has been studied, the reason for the lack of success of conservative therapeutic approaches is not well understood. METHODS: In a prospective study, tonsil specimens from 130 RT patients and 124 PTA patients were examined for the presence of extra- and intracellular bacteria using antibiotic protection assays. Staphylococcus aureus isolates from RT patients were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa-typing and MSCRAMM-gene-PCR. Their ability for biofilm formation was tested and their cell invasiveness was confirmed by a flow cytometric invasion assay (FACS), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. FINDINGS: S. aureus was the predominant species (57.7%) in RT patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes was most prevalent (20.2%) in PTA patients. Three different assays (FACS, FISH, antibiotic protection assay) showed that nearly all RT-associated S. aureus strains were located inside tonsillar cells. Correspondingly, the results of the MSCRAMM-gene-PCRs confirmed that 87% of these S. aureus isolates were invasive strains and not mere colonizers. Based upon PFGE analyses of genomic DNA and on spa-gene typing the vast majority of the S. aureus isolates belonged to different clonal lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that intracellular residing S. aureus is the most common cause of RT and indicate that S. aureus uses this location to survive the effects of antibiotics and the host immune response. A German translation of the Abstract is provided as supplementary material (Abstract S1).
TI  - Recent microbiological shifts in perianal bacterial dermatitis: Staphylococcus aureus predominance.
AB  - Traditionally, bacterial infections of the anal skin have been found to be caused by Streptococcus. The aim of this study was to determine the breakdown of bacterial isolates and the current presentation of bacterial diseases involving the perineum. From the chart review of children who had bacterial cultures of the anus from 2005 to 2008 in a pediatric dermatology practice population in New York City, 26 pediatric patients (ages 5 months to 12 yrs) who had the indications of anal erythema or recurrent buttocks dermatitis were identified. Bacterial cultures of 17 patients grew pathogens, that of 14 (82% of identifiably infected patients) grew Staphylococcus aureus, in 11 as a solo pathogen (6 MSSA and 5 MRSA in 2 family clusters). Streptococcus was identified in three patients, two on culture and one on latex agglutination test; and two patients were identified as having both group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus (2 MSSA and 1 MRSA). In patients with S. aureus perianally, concurrent small papules and pustules of the buttocks or extension of the erythema to adjacent buttock skin was the primary clinical feature distinguishing this condition from isolated streptococcal disease. Whereas Streptococcal infections of the anus and buttocks occur commonly, Staphylococcus aureus has become the leading cause of anal bacterial infection in the setting of skin involvement; therefore, antibacterial therapy for anal and buttock bacterial infections should be tailored accordingly.
TI  - [Emergence pathogens infections in ENT Department of Children's hospital in 2005-2008].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of medicine, in this the new techniques and antibiotic therapy enlarged the survivability of patients in hospital. Applying antibiotics caused breakthrough in treatment stepping out in ill's group infections treated in hospital, however enlarging resistance is natural this effect, resulting from: the selection of resistant strains, the formation of new mechanisms of resistance, and/or the spreading of gene of resistance. Multidrug-resistant strains were included to emergence-pathogens group: MRSA, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, VRE, Gram-negative producing beta-lactamase of type the ESBL and/or resistant to carbapenems. Emergence-pathogens occurrence leads to: therapeutic failures, the use extorts in therapy of dear medicines or with possibility of workings undesirable. The multidrug-resistant strains spread in hospital environment easily, especially on departments about high waste of medicines with the patients' simultaneously large susceptibility on infection, resulting mainly with state of reduced resistance of organism. The control of hospital infections recognize by present hospitality for the most important criterion of quality of work. AIM: Analysis of the emergence-pathogens isolated during treatment in hospital in 2005-2008, from special regard the ENT Department. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50586 children treated in this period in hospital in which was executed 39386 bacteriological investigations, in this 6528 (12.9%) children in ENT Department in which was executed 1566 bacteriological investigations (3.98%). The diagnostics were executed according to routine microbiological procedures with qualification of resistance to antibiotics. RESULTS: Emergence-pathogens infection was confirmed at 2369 children's (4.68%) treated in Hospital, in this in ENT Department at 84 children (1.29%). The most frequent emergence-pathogens in ENT Department were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-resistant and average sensitive on penicillin, Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-resistant and average sensitive to penicillin and Rotavirus infections are the most frequent hospital infections. The systematic microbiological supervision is indispensable in prevention the spreading of infections of the emergence-pathogens in hospital.
TI  - CEM-101 activity against Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CEM-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against Gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. Experiments for determination of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (PAE), and drug interactions were performed for CEM-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. The MBCs of CEM-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and CEM-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. Timed-killing curve testing showed that CEM-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-CFU/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. The propensity of CEM-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). In multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were USA300 isolates) resistant to CEM-101 emerged. That number was comparable to the number resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. Erythromycin induced CEM-101 resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, CEM-101 resistance induction was not observed. CEM-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent PAE against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for Gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). No antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with CEM-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall, this new antimicrobial agent (CEM-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that CEM-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.
TI  - Synthesis of Ag/CNT hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
AB  - Ag-coated CNTs hybrid nanoparticles (Ag/CNTs) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (DMF) and silver (I) acetate precursors in the presence of CNTs. The morphology of Ag/CNTs was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The Nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% Ag/CNTs mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. The dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. Extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. The Nylon-6/Ag/CNT hybrid polymer nanocomposite (HPNC) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. The failure stress and modulus of the extruded HPNC fibers (doped with 1% Ag/CNTs) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded Nylon-6 fiber, respectively. DSC results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for HPNC fibers. The antibacterial activity of the Ag-coated CNTs, commercial Ag, neat Nylon-6 and plain CNTs were evaluated. Ag-coated CNTs at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the Kirby-Bauer assay. The mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. By comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. The zones of inhibition obtained for Nylon-6 Ag-coated CNT powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat Nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. Further, the Nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with Ag/CNTs inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. Our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with Ag-coated CNTs have significant antimicrobial activity.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Uncovering newly emerging variants of Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic agent.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is recognized as a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. Two large-scale outbreaks of severe S. suis epidemics occurred in China in 1998 and 2005 that posed serious concerns to public health and challenged the conventional conception that opportunistic infections of S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans were only sporadic cases. An extensive, collaborative study on Chinese SS2 variants, which exhibit strong invasiveness and high pathogenicity, has resulted in the description of a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and a putative pathogenicity island (termed 89K). The abbreviation of STSS is used for the severe disease caused by both Staphylococci and Streptococci. The main virulence factors involved in STSS caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes consist of so-called superantigens or molecules that trigger a nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of T cells and massive cytokine release. However, although a collection of new virulence factors have been described, no superantigen candidates have been found for SS2 strains, implying that a different mechanism could be involved in the STSS form caused by SS2 variants.
TI  - [Bacteriophage lysins: progress and perspective--a review].
AB  - Phage endolysin targets the integrate cell wall and attack bonds in the peptidoglycan, resulting in degradation of bacteria. It features two or three domain structures, involving one or two catalytic domains and one binding domain. Endolysin is a promising antibiotic agent against gram-positive bacteria pathogen, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to antibiotics, it is more specific and tested bacteria show no resistance to lysin. Therefore, it's a feasible measure for solving drug resistant problem. Beyond this, it is highly active and rapid lysis efficiency and has synergy effect when used together or with other antibiotics. Antibody against endolysin will not neutralize its activity. So endolysin treatment may be a new approach for preventing and controlling of bacteria pathogen.
TI  - Complement inhibition by gram-positive pathogens: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications.
AB  - The plasma proteins of the complement system are essential in the innate immune response against bacteria. Complement labels bacteria with opsonins to support phagocytosis and generates chemoattractants to attract phagocytes to the site of infection. In turn, bacterial human pathogens have evolved different strategies to specifically impair the complement response. Here, we review the large arsenal of complement inhibitors produced by the gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Group A Streptococcus. We discuss how these bacterial molecules provide us with new tools to treat both infectious and inflammatory disease conditions in humans.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - How microorganisms avoid phagocyte attraction.
AB  - Microorganisms have developed several mechanisms to modulate the host immune system to increase their survival and propagation in the host. Their presence in the host is not only revealed by self-produced peptides but also through host-derived chemokines and active complement fragments. These so-called chemoattractants are recognized by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed on leukocyte cell membranes. Activation of GPCRs triggers leukocyte activation and guides their recruitment to the site of infection. Therefore, GPCRs play a central role in leukocyte trafficking leading to microbial clearance. It is therefore not surprising that microorganisms are able to sabotage this arm of the immune response. Different microorganisms have evolved a variety of tactics to modulate GPCR activation. Here, we review the mechanisms and proteins used by major human pathogens and less virulent microorganisms that affect GPCR signaling. While viruses generally produce receptor and chemoattractant mimics, parasites and bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Bordetella pertussis secrete proteins that affect receptor signaling, directly antagonize receptors, cleave stimuli, and even prevent stimulus generation. As the large arsenal of GPCR modulators aids prolonged microbial persistence in the host, their study provides us a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - [Myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  - Myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. Clostridia (C. perfringens, C. novyi, C. septicum, C. sordellii, C. histolyticum) are dominant and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. Cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. Russia has become the largest opiate market in Europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. In the Russian Federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results in a rise of cases of Clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. Gas gangrene in HIV-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. The analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in HIV-positive patients.
TI  - Bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties of a standardized Echinacea extract (Echinaforce): dual actions against respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Common symptoms of upper respiratory infections, such as sore throat, cough, and  inflammation, are often caused by bacteria, sometimes as a complication of virus infection. Extracts of Echinacea purpurea (Asteraceae) have been advocated traditionally for use by individuals suffering from these symptoms, although the underlying basis for the beneficial effects of Echinacea is not known. We hypothesized that Echinacea could inactivate certain respiratory bacteria and could also reverse inflammatory effects caused by these bacteria in epithelial cells. In order to test this we used a commercial standardized extract of Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce), and a novel cytokine array system designed to measure simultaneously the levels of 20 different cytokines secreted by bronchial epithelial cell cultures in response to infection. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep), which is often associated with sore throat and more severe pulmonary infections, was readily inactivated by Echinacea, which also completely reversed the cellular pro-inflammatory response. Hemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophila were also readily inactivated, and their pro-inflammatory responses reversed. Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and sensitive strains) and Mycobacterium smegmatis were less sensitive to the bactericidal effects of Echinacea however, but their pro-inflammatory responses were still completely reversed. In contrast some other pathogens tested, including Candida albicans, were relatively resistant. Thus Echinaforce) exerts a dual action against several important respiratory bacteria, a killing effect and an anti-inflammatory effect. These results support the concept of using a standardized Echinacea preparation to control symptoms associated with bacterial respiratory infections.
TI  - Fatal necrotizing fasciitis following elective inguinal hernia repair.
AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) following elective hernia repair are extremely uncommon, though they can occur following emergency surgery for complicated hernias. They are also usually seen in individuals with impaired immunity. We report a case of fatal necrotizing fasciitis following elective hernia repair in an otherwise healthy young patient. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose this condition early, as it is difficult to differentiate it from superficial surgical site infection.
TI  - Identification of a plasmid-borne resistance gene cluster comprising the resistance genes erm(T), dfrK, and tet(L) in a porcine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST398 strain.
AB  - A novel plasmid-borne resistance gene cluster comprising the genes erm(T) for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance, dfrK for trimethoprim resistance, and tet(L) for tetracycline resistance was identified in a porcine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sequence type 398 (ST398) strain. This erm(T)-dfrK-tet(L) region was flanked by copies of the novel IS element ISSau10. The erm(T) region resembled that of Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pRW35. The erm(T) gene of pKKS25 was expressed constitutively due to a 57-bp deletion in the erm(T) translational attenuator.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Antimicrobial study of newly synthesized 6-substituted indolo[1,2-c]quinazolines.
AB  - A new series of indolo[1,2-c]quinazoline derivatives were prepared in good yield  through reaction of 2-(o-aminophenyl)indole with a variety of arylaldehydes. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral studies and elemental analysis. All the title compounds were investigated for their activity against certain strains of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) and pathogenic Fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Trichoderma viridae). Ampicillin and ketoconazole were used as reference compounds. The results revealed that some of synthesized compounds displayed marked activity against all the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin.
AB  - Two series of novel 3-O-carbamoyl derivatives of clarithromycin and 11,12-cyclic  carbonate azithromycin were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. Compounds 4j and 4k were the most potent activity against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which were comparable to those of clarithromycin and azithromycin. Compounds 4d, 4h and 4i showed potent activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the mef gene and compounds 4h and 4i displayed greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm gene. Compound 7c exhibited improved activity against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae encoded by the erm and mef genes.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin 4''-O-carbamate derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 11,12-cyclic carbonate azithromycin 4''-O-carbamate derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. Compounds 7b and 7d were the most effective (0.5 and 0.5 microg ml(-1)) against two strains of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae whose resistance was encoded by the erm gene and the erm and mef genes, respectively. Compounds 7a, 7e and 7g showed significantly potent activity against erythromycin-susceptible strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. pyogenes. These results suggest that the introduction of the prolonged arylalkylcarbamoyl group to the C-4'' position can dramatically enhance the activity against erythromycin-resistant bacteria encoded by the erm gene or the erm and mef genes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Rapid exchange of bound ADP on the Staphylococcus aureus replication initiation protein DnaA.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, regulatory inactivation of the replication initiator DnaA occurs after initiation as a result of hydrolysis of bound ATP to ADP, but it has been unknown how DnaA is controlled to coordinate cell growth and chromosomal replication in gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. This study examined the roles of ATP binding and its hydrolysis in the regulation of the S. aureus DnaA activity. In vitro, S. aureus DnaA melted S. aureus oriC in the presence of ATP but not ADP by a mechanism independent of ATP hydrolysis. Unlike E. coli DnaA, binding of ADP to S. aureus DnaA was unstable. As a result, at physiological concentrations of ATP, ADP bound to S. aureus DnaA was rapidly exchanged for ATP, thereby regenerating the ability of DnaA to form the open complex in vitro. Therefore, we examined whether formation of ADP-DnaA participates in suppression of replication initiation in vivo. Induction of the R318H mutant of the AAA+ sensor 2 protein, which has decreased intrinsic ATPase activity, caused over-initiation of chromosome replication in S. aureus, suggesting that formation of ADP-DnaA suppresses the initiation step in S. aureus. Together with the biochemical features of S. aureus DnaA, the weak ability to convert ATP-DnaA into ADP-DnaA and the instability of ADP-DnaA, these results suggest that there may be unidentified system(s) for reducing the cellular ratio of ATP-DnaA to ADP-DnaA in S. aureus and thereby delaying the re-initiation of DNA replication.
TI  - Tumor-associated and microbial proteases compromise host IgG effector functions by a single cleavage proximal to the hinge.
AB  - The successful elimination of pathogenic cells and microorganisms by the humoral  immune system relies on effective interactions between host immunoglobulins and Fc gamma receptors on effector cells, in addition to the complement system. Essential Ig motifs that direct those interactions reside within the conserved IgG lower hinge/CH2 interface. We noted that a group of tumor-related and microbial proteases cleaved human IgG1s in that region, and the "nick" of just one of the heavy chains profoundly inhibited IgG1 effector functions. We focused on IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) since IgG1 is the most abundant human subclass and demonstrates robust Fc-mediated effector functions. The loss of Fc-mediated cell killing activities was correlated with diminished binding to the Fc gamma family of receptors, but a similar decrease in affinity was not observed toward the FcRn receptor that maintains IgG in circulation. Endogenous human IgG cleavage products of comparable size to mAbs with the single cleavage were detected by Western blot analysis in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in breast carcinoma extracts. Their detection is problematic under physiological conditions, since there is no loss of structure, and antigen-binding capability is unaffected. These findings suggest that within the hostile proteolytic microenvironments associated with many diseases, key effector functions of host IgGs, or therapeutic Abs, may be compromised.
TI  - Group a Streptococcus: a loser in the battle with autophagy.
AB  - Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation/recycling system for turning over  cellular constituents. In one of the more remarkable findings among the recent developments in the field of autophagy, it was found that autophagy can also eliminate bacteria that invade host cells. The first evidence of this phenomenon came from an analysis of group A Streptococcus (GAS), the etiological agent underlying diverse human diseases. This bacterium is often internalized into nonphagocytic cells via the endocytic pathway, and then escapes from endosomes into the cytoplasm by secreting streptolysin O. The bacteria that escape into the cytoplasm induce and are captured by a unique membranous structure, which shares characteristics and molecular machinery with canonical autophagosomes but has some distinctions, including its large size. Subsequent fusion with lysosomes causes the death of most intracellular GAS. These findings have opened up a new field of innate immunity: the intracellular immune system against pathogens that penetrate the first defense of the endocytic pathway. The role of autophagy in Staphylococcus aureus infection is also discussed.
TI  - Bacterial coinfections in lung tissue specimens from fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) - United States, May-August 2009.
AB  - In previous influenza pandemics, studies of autopsy specimens have shown that most deaths attributed to influenza A virus infection occurred concurrently with bacterial pneumonia, but such evidence has been lacking for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). To help determine the role of bacterial coinfection in the current influenza pandemic, CDC examined postmortem lung specimens from patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) for bacterial causes of pneumonia. During May 1-August 20, 2009, medical examiners and local and state health departments submitted specimens to CDC from 77 U.S. patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). This report summarizes the demographic and clinical findings from these cases and the laboratory evaluation of the specimens. Evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 patients, including 10 caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Duration of illness was available for 17 of the 22 patients; median duration was 6 days (range: 1-25 days). Fourteen of 18 patients for whom information was available sought medical care while ill, and eight (44%) were hospitalized. These findings confirm that bacterial lung infections are occurring among patients with fatal cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and underscore both the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia and the need for early recognition of bacterial pneumonia in persons with influenza.

TI  - [Collagen hydroxyapatite (Healos) saturated with gentamicin or levofloxacin. In vitro antimicrobial effectiveness - a pilot study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The functions of synthetic bone graft substitutes include not only structural support to provide bone healing and osseous ingrowth but also the ability to serve as a local antibiotic delivery system to prevent or treat infections of the spine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The impregnation and antibiotic efficiency of gentamicin and levofloxacin with Healos was investigated in vitro and compared with Healos without an antibiotic additive. These antibiotic-loaded bone graft substitutes were examined without dilution and with 10-fold and 100-fold dilution for activity against spondylodiscitis-causing bacteria on different agar plates using an agar diffusion method. RESULTS: All hydroxyapatite (HA)/collagen-saturated diluted antibiotics showed elliptical inhibition zones on the corresponding agar plates. For both antibiotics, there was a linear correlation between dilution and area of the inhibition zone. CONCLUSION: The analysis showed that the antimicrobial activity of HA/collagen-saturated antibiotics corresponded to the antimicrobial dilutions. These results should be further analyzed using in vivo studies to determine the remaining antibiotic efficiency after implantation of bone graft substitutes.
TI  - Bacterial surface protein L binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins S100A8/A9.
AB  - Finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. Some isolates of F. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein L, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (B1-B5) that bind Igs through interactions with Ig L chains. The present study shows that the N-terminal A domain of protein L binds S100A8/A9, antibacterial proteins present in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. As a result, protein L-expressing F. magna are protected against killing by S100A8/A9. Igs and S100A8/A9 were found to interact independently with protein L, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.
TI  - Swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  - Health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. Secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes), Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. The UK Department of Health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. Suggested severity criteria have not been validated in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. Antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. These recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in UK hospitals. This article, written on behalf of the BSAC Council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - Cervid herpesvirus 2, the primary agent in an outbreak of infectious keratoconjunctivitis in semidomesticated reindeer.
AB  - An outbreak of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) occurred in semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Troms County, Norway, in February 2009. Twenty-eight animals with clinical symptoms and 12 apparently healthy animals were investigated. They ranged in age from calves of the year to 4-year-old animals (mean, 1.9 years; standard deviation, +/-0.9). The seroprevalence of antibodies against cervid herpesvirus 2 (CvHV2) was 86% in animals with IKC and 42% in unaffected animals. For the 28 clinically affected animals, CvHV2 was detected by PCR in swabs obtained from the eye (82%), nose (64%), and vagina (24%), and CvHV2 was isolated from eye swabs from 8 animals. Virus was not isolated from clinically unaffected animals but was detected by PCR in eye swab samples from five of them. The viral activity, assessed by the ability to cause a cytopathic effect in cell culture, increased with the severity of clinical symptoms, but in severe clinical cases, virus was absent and secondary bacterial infections were dominant. Moraxella sp. isolates were obtained from seven animals, and those from two animals were identified as Moraxella bovoculi. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sp., and Arcanobacterium pyogenes were also isolated. It is concluded that CvHV2, which is endemic in reindeer, can cause IKC, probably most commonly as a primary infection of calves. This can be a very painful and devastating disease of economic importance for reindeer herders. This is the first report of CvHV2 as the primary agent of IKC in reindeer. This is also the first isolation of this virus in reindeer under natural herding conditions.
TI  - [Etiology, resistance and diagnostic techniques in skin and skin structure infections].
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are common and, generally, uncomplicated at the time of initial presentation. However, these infections can worsen quickly when there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. The clinical presentation of most SSTI is the culmination of a microbial three-step process as follow: i) bacterial adherence to host cells; ii) invasion of tissue with evasion of host defences, and iii) elaboration of toxins. Even if the microbiology of wounds has been actively investigated in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing. There are also several means by which bacteria penetrate the skin barrier. The most common route is through a break in the barrier (lacerations, bite wounds, scratches, instrumentations, pre-existing skin conditions, wounds or ulcers, burns and surgery); other routes of penetration include contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g. osteomyelitis), entry of water into the skin pores, and, rarely, haematogenous seeding (i.e septic emboli). From what it was said, many microorganisms, above all from the normal skin microbiota, can be involved in these often polymicrobial infections, with Gram-positives such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp being predominant. Many other aerobic and anaerobic species, including Gram-negative bacilli, can also be involved. Even if the diagnosis of most SSTI is based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, guided by clinical information, can help to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate the characteristics of specific pathogens. These microbiological investigations may include blood cultures, tissue swabs with culture, and needle aspiration. In rapidly progressing infections, empirical therapy is essential, although microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate. Furthermore, the number of microorganisms becoming resistant to many usual drugs and the changing microbial epidemiology of these infections, such as the emergence of CA-MRSA, required a constant cooperation between the microbiology lab and the clinician in order to address microbiological aspects that can be critical to the successful management of SSTI.
TI  - Selective antimicrobial action is provided by phenol-soluble modulins derived from Staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal resident of the skin.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of innate immune defense against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. In this study, we hypothesized that peptides produced by a normal microbial resident of human skin, Staphylococcus epidermidis, might also act as an antimicrobial shield and contribute to normal defense at the epidermal interface. We show by circular dichroism and tryptophan spectroscopy that phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) gamma and delta produced by S. epidermidis have an alpha-helical character and a strong lipid membrane interaction similar to mammalian AMPs such as LL-37. Both PSMs directly induced lipid vesicle leakage and exerted selective antimicrobial action against skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. PSMs functionally cooperated with each other and LL-37 to enhance antimicrobial action. Moreover, PSMs reduced Group A Streptococcus (GAS) but not the survival of S. epidermidis on mouse skin. Thus, these data suggest that the production of PSMgamma and PSMdelta by S. epidermidis can benefit cutaneous immune defense by selectively inhibiting the survival of skin pathogens while maintaining the normal skin microbiome.
TI  - Suppurative lymphadenitis.
AB  - Suppurative lymphadenitis is an important and common form of soft tissue infection. Most acute cases of suppurative lymphadenitis are caused by Staphylococcus aureus or by Streptococcus pyogenes. Empiric antibiotic therapy is frequently successful in the early stages of the disease process, but increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in particular has necessitated a shift in antibiotic choice that is dictated primarily by specific local resistance patterns. Several other organisms and noninfectious inflammatory processes may give rise to a clinical syndrome suggestive of suppurative lymphadenitis. Failure to respond to empiric antibiotics should trigger a diagnostic re-evaluation to determine the need for surgical intervention and/or the possibility of alternative microbiologic diagnoses.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy, safety and PK-PD analysis of tebipenem pivoxil in a phase II  clinical trial in otolaryngological infections].
AB  - We conducted a double-blind intergroup comparative study investigating the efficacy, safety and PK-PD analysis of the new oral carbapenem antibacterial drug tebipenem pivoxil (TBPM-PI) for the treatment of otolaryngological infections in adults to establish the recommended clinical dosage. The primary endpoint was the clinical effect of a 7-day oral administration of TBPM-PI to subjects with confirmed cases of infection by any of the 5 major bacterial species causative for otolaryngological infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae) assigned to three groups set according to the TBPM-PI dosage, namely, a 450 mg group (150 mg t.i.d), a 500 mg group (250 mg b.i.d), and a 900 mg group (300 mg t.i.d). 1. Clinical efficacy: At the end of administration or at discontinuation, the efficacy rate for the 112 subjects in the efficacy analysis set was 72.1% (31/43 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 88.6% (31/35 subjects) in the 500 mg group, and 85.3% (29/34 subjects) in the 900 mg group. Both the 500 mg and 900 mg groups showed a high efficacy rate of over 80%. 2. Bacteriological efficacy: The disappearance rate of the pre-administration causative bacteria (5 major bacterial species) at the end of administration (at discontinuation), it was 92.2% (47/51 strains) in the 450 mg group, 94.7% (36/38 strains) in the 500 mg group, and 91.7% (33/36 strains) in the 900 mg group. All the groups showed a high disappearance rate, with no large differences among them. All strains of S. pneumoniae, including PRSP, as well as those of S. pyogenes and M. catarrhalis disappeared. The overall disappearance rate of H. influenzae was 78.6%, namely, 76.9% in the 450 mg group, 100% in the 500 mg group, and 66.7% in the 900 mg group, showing differences among the groups. 3. PK-PD: The PK-PD analysis was executed in 124 strains isolated from 111 subjects in which the plasma TBPM concentration and the MIC of causative organism were measured. The target value of the PK-PD parameter was examined from the relation between PK-PD parameter and bacteriological efficacy. The presumed target value of AUCf/MIC was 10-20, Cmaxf/MIC was 4. On the other hand, a clear relation was not found between T>MIC and the bacteriological efficacy. 4. SAFETY: The incidence of adverse reactions related to symptoms and signs was 28.8% (21/73 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 35.8% (24/67 subjects) in the 500mg group, and 30.6% (22/72 subjects) in the 900 mg group. The incidence of abnormal changes in laboratory test values was 8.2% (6/73 subjects) in the 450 mg group, 9.2% (6/65 subjects) in the 500 mg group, and 9.9% (7/71 subjects) in the 900 mg group. There were no differences in either of these categories among the groups, and the incidence was considered not to be correlated with dose. Based on the above, we considered that TBPM-PI at doses of 250 mg b.i.d (500 mg/day) promises high clinical usefulness for the treatment of otolaryngological infections in adults.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of recent isolates from otorhinolaryngological infections to garenoxacin and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 339 isolates from the otorhinolaryngological  infections at the otorhinolaryngological departments at 27 universities in Japan, as well as their 108 affiliated hospitals and practitioners during January 2007 to June 2007 was determined to garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, cefditoren, and cefcapene applicable for otorhinolaryngological infections. The in vitro activities of these drugs against the isolates were compared. The quinolones including GRNX were potently active against Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains (PISP and PRSP), Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, except for MRSA, a major causative pathogens for otorhinolaryngological infection. When MIC ranges, MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that GRNX was the most active of them. GRNX was potently active against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis same as that of other quinolones tested. In conclusion, GRNX exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from otorhinolaryngological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of otorhinolaryngological infections.
TI  - The disruption of bacterial membrane integrity through ROS generation induced by  nanohybrids of silver and clay.
AB  - Nanohybrids, synthesized via silver nitrate reduction in the presence of silicate clay, exhibit a high potency against bacterial growth. The plate-like clay, due to its anionic surface charges and a large surface area, serves as the support for the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) approximately 30 nm in diameter. The nanohybrid consisting of Ag/silicate at a 7/93 weight ratio inhibited the growth of dermal pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyrogens, as well as the methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA and ORSA). Scanning electron microscope revealed that these nanohybrids were adherent on the surface of individual bacteria. The thin silicate plates provide a surface for immobilizing AgNPs in one highly concentrated area but prevent them from entering the cell membrane. Subsequent cytotoxicity studies indicated that surface contact with the reduced AgNPs on clay is sufficient to initiate cell death. This toxicity is related to a loss in membrane integrity due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The hybridization of AgNPs on clay surface is viable for generating a new class of nanohybrids exhibiting mild cytotoxicity but high efficacy for battling drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus is the most common identified cause of cellulitis: a systematic review.
AB  - We utilized Medline to perform a systematic review of the literature to quantify  the aetiology of cellulitis with intact skin. Of 808 patients with cellulitis, 127-129 (15.7-16.0%) patients had positive needle aspiration and/or punch biopsy cultures from intact skin. Of the patients with positive cultures, 65 (50.4-51.2%) had cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus, 35 (27.1-27.6%) for group A streptococcus, and 35-37 (27.1-29.1%) for other pathogens. The most common aetiology of cellulitis with intact skin, when it can be determined, is S. aureus, outnumbering group A streptococcus by a ratio of nearly 2:1. Given the increasing incidence of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, our findings may have critical therapeutic implications.
TI  - Site-specific N- and C-terminal labeling of a single polypeptide using sortases of different specificity.
AB  - The unique reactivity of two sortase enzymes, SrtA(staph) from Staphylococcus aureus and SrtA(strep) from Streptococcus pyogenes, is exploited for site-specific labeling of a single polypeptide with different labels at its N and C termini. SrtA(strep) is used to label the protein's C terminus at an LPXTG site with a fluorescently labeled dialanine nucleophile. Selective N-terminal labeling of proteins containing N-terminal glycine residues is achieved using SrtA(staph) and LPXT derivatives. The generality of N-terminal labeling with SrtA(staph) is demonstrated by near-quantitative labeling of multiple protein substrates with excellent site specificity.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - In vitro ciprofloxacin resistance patterns of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens in a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last few decades the ever-increasing level of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has been a cause of worldwide concern. Fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin has been used indiscriminately for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The increased use of ciprofloxacin has led to a progressive loss of bacterial susceptibility to this antibiotic. Therefore it is necessary to have update knowledge of resistance pattern of bacteria to this antibiotic so that alternate appropriate antibiotics can be used for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trends of ciprofloxacin resistance pattern in commonly isolated gram-positive bacteria over time in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out for ciprofloxacin susceptibility patterns of 5534 isolates of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to microbiology laboratories at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia during the period from January 2002 to August 2005. RESULTS: Increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates with some fluctuations, among these isolates, were observed. For Staphylococcus aureus, it varied from 4.62, 1.83, 7.01 and 3.98%, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 97.92, 97.75, 87.01 and 88.26%, Streptococcus pyogenes 5.35, 4.47, 14.44 and 3.53% during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. Cirprofloxacin resistance during the years 2002, 2004 and 2005 for other isolates was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 30.23, 23.02 and 26.47%; enterococcus group D, 43.05, 20.68 and 57.03% and non-enterococcus group D, 62.96, 76.92 and 87.50% respectively. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-positive bacterial clinical isolates particularly Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enterococcus group D, and non-enterococcus group D, has greatly increased and ciprofloxacin no more remains the drug of choice for these infections.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from January to August, 2007. A total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 Staphylococcus aureus, 257 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 206 Haemophilus influenzae, 120 Moraxella catarrhalis, 122 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Among Haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately-resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. Two isolates (1.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. Continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.
TI  - High burden of impetigo and scabies in a tropical country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impetigo and scabies are endemic diseases in many tropical countries; however the epidemiology of these diseases is poorly understood in many areas, particularly in the Pacific. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted three epidemiological studies in 2006 and 2007 to determine the burden of disease due to impetigo and scabies in children in Fiji using simple and easily reproducible methodology. Two studies were performed in primary school children (one study was a cross-sectional study and the other a prospective cohort study over ten months) and one study was performed in infants (cross-sectional). The prevalence of active impetigo was 25.6% (95% CI 24.1-27.1) in primary school children and 12.2% (95% CI 9.3-15.6) in infants. The prevalence of scabies was 18.5% (95% CI 17.2-19.8) in primary school children and 14.0% (95% CI 10.8-17.2) in infants. The incidence density of active impetigo, group A streptococcal (GAS) impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus impetigo and scabies was 122, 80, 64 and 51 cases per 100 child-years respectively. Impetigo was strongly associated with scabies infestation (odds ratio, OR, 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.7) and was more common in Indigenous Fijian children when compared with children of other ethnicities (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.7-4.7). The majority of cases of active impetigo in the children in our study were caused by GAS. S. aureus was also a common cause (57.4% in school aged children and 69% in infants). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that the impetigo and scabies disease burden in children in Fiji has been underestimated, and possibly other tropical developing countries in the Pacific. These diseases are more than benign nuisance diseases and consideration needs to be given to expanded public health initiatives to improve their control.
TI  - Sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections.
AB  - In addition to the examination of clinical signs, several laboratory markers have been measured for diagnostics and monitoring of pediatric septic bone and joint infections. Traditionally erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte cell count have been used, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) has gained in popularity. We monitored 265 children at ages 3 months to 15 years with culture-positive osteoarticular infections with a predetermined series of ESR, CRP, and leukocyte count measurements. On admission, ESR exceeded 20 mm/hour in 94% and CRP exceeded 20 mg/L in 95% of the cases, the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) being 51 +/- 2 mm/hour and 87 +/- 4 mg/L, respectively. ESR normalized in 24 days and CRP in 10 days. Elevated CRP gave a slightly better sensitivity in diagnostics than ESR, but best sensitivity was gained with the combined use of ESR and CRP (98%). Elevated ESR or CRP was seen in all cases during the first 3 days. Measuring ESR and CRP on admission can help the clinician rule out an acute osteoarticular infection. CRP normalizes faster than ESR, providing a clear advantage in monitoring recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, diagnostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against MRSA and MRSE.
AB  - Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. This report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous Ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus. The bioreduction of the Ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Empiric antimicrobial therapy for pediatric skin and soft-tissue infections in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the clinical effectiveness of monotherapy with beta-lactams, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the outpatient management of nondrained noncultured skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs), in a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-endemic region. METHODS: A retrospective, nested, case-control trial was conducted with a cohort of patients from 5 urban pediatric practices in a community-acquired MRSA-endemic region. All subjects were treated as outpatients with oral monotherapy for nondrained noncultured SSTIs between January 2004 and March 2007. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as a drainage procedure, hospitalization, change in antibiotic, or second antibiotic prescription within 28 days. RESULTS: Of 2096 children with nondrained noncultured SSTIs, 104 (5.0%) were identified as experiencing treatment failure and were matched to 480 control subjects. Compared with beta-lactam therapy, clindamycin was equally effective but trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with an increased risk of failure. Other factors independently associated with failure included initial treatment in the emergency department, presence or history of fever, and presence of either induration or a small abscess. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with beta-lactams, clindamycin monotherapy conferred no benefit, whereas trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure in a cohort of children with nondrained noncultured SSTIs who were treated as outpatients. Even in regions with endemic community-acquired MRSA, beta-lactams may still be appropriate, first-line, empiric therapy for children presenting with these infections.
TI  - Antibacterial study of the medium chain fatty acids and their 1-monoglycerides: individual effects and synergistic relationships.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the medium chain fatty acids and their 1-monoglycerides was evaluated towards several Gram-positive strains belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Bacillus, Listeria and Streptococcus. The 1-monoglycerides were more active than the fatty acids with monolaurin being the most active compound. Interesting effects were observed when the streptococcal strain Streptococcus pyogenes was used as a test microorganism. First, blocking of the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol moiety of monolaurin led to a compound with remarkable antibacterial activity (MIC, 3.9 microg/ml). Secondly, synergistic relationships were observed between monolaurin and monocaprin as well as between monolaurin and the poorly active lauric acid when their two component mixtures were examined. The mixtures in which one of the components was 2-fold more predominant than the other one were much more active than the pure components taken individually. Moreover, the presence of the components in ratio 1:1 was disadvantageous. Synergistic relationships were also found between monolaurin and monomyristin towards Staphylococcus aureus 209 when monomyristin was in the same quantity as monolaurin or in shortage.
TI  - Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  - In more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. The "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. This study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time PCR-based commercial reagent kit. The assay targets the DNA of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaZ gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. A study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. Of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. The positive findings included 11 Staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than Staphylococcus aureus), 10 Streptococcus uberis, 2 Streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 Corynebacterium bovis, 3 Staph. aureus, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. This study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. The clearly elevated N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, PCR-based bacterial findings are able to reveal bacteriological etiology. We conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time PCR assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. Low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. This hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.
TI  - Risk factors for severe impetiginized atopic dermatitis in Japan and assessment of its microbiological features.
AB  - Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are susceptible to cutaneous bacterial infection. When such patients develop infection, some have extensive impetiginized dermatitis with high fever. To clarify the risk factors for severe impetiginized AD and its microbiological features, we reviewed clinical and microbiological data of 14 patients with impetiginized AD who were admitted to our hospital between the years 1999 and 2006. All patients had poorly controlled AD with eczematous lesions on the extensive body surface. The mean age was 28.2 years (range 18-35). Cultures of the lesional skin yielded both Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in 12 patients. S. pyogenes alone was isolated in two cases. These observations suggest that poorly controlled AD in adults is a risk factor for severe impetiginized AD and that S. pyogenes might play an important role in the development of severe clinical symptoms.
TI  - Topical retapamulin in the management of infected traumatic skin lesions.
AB  - Retapamulin is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic specifically designed for use as a topical agent. The unique mode of action by which retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis differentiates it from other nonpleuromutilin antibacterial agents that target the ribosome or ribosomal factors, minimizing the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterial classes in current use. In vitro studies show that retapamulin has high potency against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) commonly found in skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs), including S. aureus strains with resistance to agents such as macrolides, fusidic acid, or mupirocin, and other less common organisms associated with SSSIs, anaerobes, and common respiratory tract pathogens. Clinical studies have shown that twice-daily topical retapamulin for 5 days is comparable to 10 days of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions. A 1% concentration of retapamulin ointment has been approved for clinical use as an easily applied treatment with a short, convenient dosing regimen for impetigo. Given the novel mode of action, low potential for cross-resistance with established antibacterial agents, and high in vitro potency against many bacterial pathogens commonly recovered from SSSIs, retapamulin is a valuable enhancement over existing therapeutic options.
TI  - Combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in E. coli.
AB  - The increased synthesis of building blocks of IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. Using E. coli as a host, IPP and DMAPP supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign MVA (mevalonate) pathway into it. The MVA pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-CoA, and IPP and DMAPP from mevalonate, respectively. The bottom portions of MVA pathway from Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. The E. coli harboring the bottom MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. The top portions of MVA pathway were also compared and the top MVA pathway of E. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in E. coli. The whole MVA pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis, respectively. The recombinant E. coli harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without exogenous mevalonate supplementation. When comparing various E. coli strains - MG1655, DH5alpha, S17-1, XL1-Blue and BL21 - the DH5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. Using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/L at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).
TI  - Quinine is bactericidal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial properties of Quinine dihydrochloride and its MIC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Quasi-Experimental study was conducted at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi from July 2006 to November 2006. Two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from Medicine ward (W-7) having different Bacterial infections were studied. Proforma was filled to document the demographic details. Samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi were inhibited at MIC of 125 g/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at MIC of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (Dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). CONCLUSION: The concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of Quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
TI  - Bacterial tracheitis: a multi-centre perspective.
AB  - The published literature on bacterial tracheitis is limited. We report the first  multi-centre study of bacterial tracheitis together with a concise review of the literature. We conducted a retrospective study of cases admitted during the period 1993-2007 to 3 tertiary paediatric centres in the United Kingdom and 1 in Australia. A total of 34 cases were identified. 31 patients (91%) required intubation. Complications included cardiorespiratory arrest in 1, ARDS in 1, hypotension in 10, toxic shock syndrome in 1 and renal failure in 1 patient(s). Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly implicated bacterial organism, isolated from the respiratory tract in 55.8% of the cases overall. Other pathogens commonly isolated from the respiratory tract included Streptococcus pyogenes (5.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (11.8%). Viral coinfection was identified in 9 (31%) of the 29 cases in whom immunofluorescence testing was performed (influenza A in 4 cases; parainfluenza 1 in 2 cases; parainfluenza 3 in 2 cases; adenovirus in 1 case). The combined experience from 4 major paediatric intensive care units suggests that bacterial tracheitis remains a rare condition with an estimated incidence of approximately 0.1/100,000 children per year. Short-term complications were common but long-term sequelae were rare. There were no fatal outcomes, which contrasts with the high historical mortality rates and likely reflects improvements in intensive care management.
TI  - Genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria continuously encounter multiple forms of stress in their hostile environments, which leads to DNA damage. With the new insight into biology offered by genome sequences, the elucidation of the gene content encoding proteins provides clues toward understanding the microbial lifestyle related to habitat and niche. Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogenic Neisseria, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are major human pathogens causing detrimental morbidity and mortality at a global scale. An algorithm for the clustering of orthologs was established in order to identify whether orthologs of selected genes were present or absent in the genomes of the pathogenic bacteria under study. Based on the known genes for the various functions and their orthologs in selected pathogenic bacteria, an overview of the presence of the different types of genes was created. In this context, we focus on selected processes enabling genome dynamics in these particular pathogens, namely DNA repair, recombination and horizontal gene transfer. An understanding of the precise molecular functions of the enzymes participating in DNA metabolism and their importance in the maintenance of bacterial genome integrity has also, in recent years, indicated a future role for these enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Gram-positive toxic shock syndromes.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, multi-system, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multi-organ failure. It represents the most fulminant expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). The importance of Gram-positive organisms as pathogens is increasing, and TSS is likely to be underdiagnosed in patients with staphylococcal or group A streptococcal infection who present with shock. TSS results from the ability of bacterial toxins to act as superantigens, stimulating immune-cell expansion and rampant cytokine expression in a manner that bypasses normal MHC-restricted antigen processing. A repetitive cycle of cell stimulation and cytokine release results in a cytokine avalanche that causes tissue damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ dysfunction. Specific therapy focuses on early identification of the illness, source control, and administration on antimicrobial agents including drugs capable of suppressing toxin production (eg, clindamycin, linezolid). Intravenous immunoglobulin has the potential to neutralise superantigen and to mitigate subsequent tissue damage.
TI  - Molecular recognition of diverse ligands by T-cell receptors.
AB  - T-cell receptors (TCRs) are structurally related to antibodies, and also interact with a diverse set of ligands. TCRs recognize foreign peptide antigens displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and foreign lipid-based antigens presented by CD1. These interactions initiate an immune response through T-cell activation. These critical surveillance and response initiation functions of the adaptive immune system are not perfect, though, as TCR interactions with self antigens can lead to autoimmune disease. Mutated peptides can also be recognized specifically by TCRs, and may be important in tumor immunity. TCRs are also bound specifically by a family of bacterial toxins called superantigens, which over-stimulate the immune system to cause numerous human diseases.
TI  - Cervical lymphadenitis: etiology, diagnosis, and management.
AB  - Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common problem in children. The condition most commonly represents a transient response to a benign local or generalized infection. Acute bilateral cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection or streptococcal pharyngitis. Acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases. Common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis include cat-scratch disease and mycobacterial infection. Generalized lymphadenopathy is often caused by a viral infection, and less frequently by malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, and medications. Laboratory tests are not necessary in most children with cervical lymphadenopathy. Most cases of cervical lymphadenitis are self-limited and require no treatment. The treatment of acute bacterial cervical lymphadenitis without a known primary source should provide adequate coverage for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Innate immune-induced depletion of bone marrow neutrophils aggravates systemic bacterial infections.
AB  - Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in circulation and provide a primary innate immune defense function against bacterial pathogens before development of a specific immune response. These specialized phagocytes are short lived (12-24 hours) and continuously replenished from bone marrow. We found that if the host is overwhelmed by a high inoculum of Listeria monocytogenes, neutrophils are depleted despite high granulocyte-colony stimulating factor induction. In contrast to a low-dose innocuous L. monocytogenes infection, high-dose Listeria challenge blocks neutrophil recruitment to infectious abscesses and bacterial proliferation is not controlled, resulting in lethal outcomes. Administering synthetic TLR2-ligand or heat-killed bacteria during the innocuous L. monocytogenes infection reproduced these effects, once again leading to overwhelming bacterial propagation. The same stimuli also severely aggravated Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes systemic infection. These data implicate systemic innate immune stimulation as a mechanism of bone marrow neutrophil exhaustion which negatively influences the outcome of bacterial infections.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility patterns of bacterial species isolated in outpatients of the Metropolitan Region, Chile, year 2007].
AB  - A partial surveillance of bacterial in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics, performed by a outpatient clinic, at Santiago, Chile, during year 2007, has yielded the following results: Staphylococcus aureus (n: 232) 3% of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance; Streptococcus pyogenes (n: 120) 6% of macrolides resistance; Haemophilus influenzae nt (n: 60) 12% of ampicillin and 3% of chloramphenicol resistance; Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n: 170): 78% of penicillin, 56% of tetracyclin and 32% of ciprofloxacin resistance; Escherichia coli obtained from urine: (adults n: 3.066, children n: 260) 27-28% of sulpha-trimethoprim resistance, 15% (children) -21 % (adults) of cefadroxil resistance.
TI  - Improved photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive bacteria using hematoporphyrin encapsulated in liposomes and micelles.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising treatment modality for local infections. To increase the efficacy of photosensitizer, hematoporphyrin (Hp) was used as a model drug and encapsulated in liposomes and micelles. The bactericidal efficacy of the carrier-entrapped Hp was assessed against gram-positive bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hp was encapsulated in liposomes by a modified reversed-phase evaporation and extrusion method. Micelle-Hp was prepared by the reversed-phase evaporation method. Spectroscopic analysis was used to characterize the properties of Hp in PBS, liposome or micelle. The PDI efficacy was examined by using gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: The absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that Hp encapsulated in liposomes and micelles is less likely to exist in aggregated form compared to that generally seen in an aqueous medium. Liposome- or micelle-Hp can induce complete eradication of the bacteria above a critical Hp dose, which is significantly lower than the dose required when using the non-encapsulated Hp. Furthermore, the PDI effect of the Hp encapsulated in micelles was superior to the Hp encapsulated in liposomes at lower Hp doses. Similar PDI results were also found in S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that photosensitizer entrapped in micelle exert similar or better PDI efficacy than that of liposome, which indicates this formulation may be useful for the treatment of local infections in the future.
TI  - Microbiological profile of a new topical antibacterial: retapamulin ointment 1%.
AB  - Retapamulin is a new topical pleuromutilin antibiotic for the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections, including impetigo. In vitro studies indicate that retapamulin has a unique mode of action that minimizes the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterials and a limited potential for resistance development. Its spectrum of activity includes the most likely causative pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In the Global Surveillance Program, retapamulin was highly active in vitro, including against strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin, mupirocin or fusidic acid. In clinical studies, retapamulin was noninferior to fusidic acid and oral cefalexin, achieving per-pathogen success rates of 86-99%. Topical retapamulin has a good safety profile and is associated with high patient compliance.
TI  - A cluster of ecthyma outbreaks caused by a single clone of invasive and highly infective Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ecthyma is an invasive, ulcerated skin infection. Four ecthyma outbreaks occurred in different infantry units in the Israeli Defense Force from October 2004 through February 2005. Morbidity attack rates in the first 3 outbreaks were 89% (49 of 55 soldiers), 73% (32 of 44), and 82% (37 of 45). In the fourth outbreak, in which early intervention (antimicrobial treatment and improvement of hygiene) was applied, the attack rate was 25% (10 of 40 soldiers). In the first outbreak cluster, 4 soldiers experienced poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and 5 cases of systemic sequelae were recorded (1 case of severe septic shock, 3 cases of pneumonia, and 1 case of septic olecranon bursitis). METHODS: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from ecthyma sores, oropharynx, and anterior nares of affected and unaffected soldiers involved in all 4 outbreaks. RESULTS: Although the S. aureus isolates had different genomic profiles, >90% of S. pyogenes isolates were identified as belonging to a single clone, emm type 81, T type 8. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the hygiene levels of the soldiers and their living conditions were probably the most important cause for the difference in attack rates, wound severity, and systemic sequelae found between and within the units. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the possible ramifications of the combination of a virulent and highly infective S. pyogenes strain and poor living conditions, and it emphasizes the importance of early intervention in such conditions.
TI  - Prospective, randomized trial of 10 days versus 30 days of antimicrobial treatment, including a short-term course of parenteral therapy, for childhood septic arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for septic arthritis in children is antimicrobials for several weeks (initially administered intravenously) and arthrotomy (at least for the hip and shoulder joints). No sufficiently powered study has examined the true need for these treatments. METHODS: In a randomized, multicenter prospective trial in Finland, children aged 3 months to 15 years who had culture-positive septic arthritis were randomized to receive clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days or 30 days (intravenously for the first 2-4 days). The number of surgical procedures was kept to a minimum. Illness was monitored with preset criteria. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued when the clinical response was good and the C-reactive protein level decreased to 20 mg/L. The primary end point was full recovery without need for further administration of antimicrobial therapy because of an osteoarticular indication during the 12 months after therapy. RESULTS: Of the total 130 cases, 88% were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pyogenes; 63 patients were in the short-term treatment group, and 67 were in the long-term treatment group. The median durations of antimicrobial treatment were 10 days and 30 days, respectively. Surgical procedures that were more extensive than percutaneous joint aspiration were performed for 12% of patients, with no preponderance to hip or shoulder arthritis. Two late-onset infections occurred in 1 child in the long-term treatment group; however, all patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Large doses of well-absorbed antimicrobials for <2 weeks (initially administered intravenously) and only 1 joint aspiration are sufficient for treatment of most cases of childhood septic arthritis, regardless of the infecting pathogen or anatomical site, if the clinical response is good and the C-reactive protein level normalizes shortly after initiation of treatment.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Novel ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides with antibacterial activity against key respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The new ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides, N''-substituted 9a-(N'-carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (4), 9a-(N'-thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (6), 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (8) and 9a-[N'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-N'-(thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (10) of 9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A (2), were synthesized and structurally characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The new compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of erythromycin susceptible and erythromycin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. These compounds displayed an excellent overall antibacterial in vitro activity against erythromycin sensitive gram-positive strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and good against negative strains, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. In addition, several ureas with naphthyl substituents (4f, 4g, 4h) showed better activity in comparison to azithromycin against inducible resistant S. pyogenes. Ureas with naphthyl substituents 4g, 4h and thiourea 8h displayed moderate activity against constitutively resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Pediatric parapneumonic pleural effusions: experience in a university central hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pleural effusions can complicate pneumonias in children and adolescents and are usually associated with a long hospital stay and increased morbidity. AIMS: To characterise a population of patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion and to establish possible prognostic factors on admission based on clinical, imaging and analytical data. To correlate treatment options with the outcome. METHODS: Case review of patients under 18 years old with parapneumonic pleural effusion, admitted between July 1997 - June 2004 (7 years). RESULTS: 118 patients were included, 60% male, with mean age 7 years. The incidence of pleural effusion increased throughout the period of the study. The admissions occurred predominantly in autumn and winter. On admission 60% of patients had respiratory distress and 39% chest pain. In 40% loculations were found on admission and were associated with longer hospital stay, longer course of antibiotic therapy and more frequent need for surgery. Thoracentesis was performed in 72% of patients (mean pH pleural fluid 7.24). The aetiologic agent was identified in 17% of cases: Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Staphylococcus aureus (four) and Streptococcus pyogenes (four). In our study, 52% of patients underwent pleural drainage and 18% surgery. Median length of hospital stay was 15 days with mean 16.4 days (2 - 51). DISCUSSION: Factors associated with worse prognosis were respiratory distress, loculations, empyema, low pH in pleural fluid, glucose or proteins in pleural fluid, high lactic dehydrogenase level in pleural fluid and high serum C-reactive protein. Pleural drainage and/or surgery can shorten hospital stay and improve outcome. CONCLUSION: Complicated parapneumonic pleural effusions are managed successfully in centres with experience in the different types of procedure that might be necessary.
TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic hemolytic activities of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium and CAMP-like hemolysis of Arcanobacterium phocae and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum with Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus.
AB  - A total of 57 bacteria representing eight species of genus Arcanobacterium (A.) were investigated for hemolytic properties on blood agar containing sheep and rabbit blood and for CAMP-like reactions. An enhanced hemolysis on blood agar containing rabbit blood compared to sheep blood could be observed for A. haemolyticum, less pronounced for A. hippocoleae and A. pluranimalium. A synergistic hemolytic reaction with staphylococcal beta-hemolysin appeared to be constantly visible for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, with Streptococcus agalactiae for A. phocae and A. haemolyticum, with Rhodococcus equi for A. phocae, A. haemolyticum, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes and with A. haemolyticum for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, respectively. A reverse CAMP-reaction in the zone of staphylococcal beta-hemolysin could be observed for A.phocae and A.haemolyticum. In addition, a novel CAMP-like reaction could be noted between Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, and A. phocae and A. haemolyticum. These synergistic or antagonistic hemolytic properties could possibly be used as additional criteria for identification of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium.
TI  - [Pediatric dermatology. New aspects of bacterial skin infections in children].
AB  - We review important aspects of bacterial skin diseases in children, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Borrelia burgdorferi. For early diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in children it is important to be familiar with the variable clinical presentation of erythema migrans and early hematogenic dissemination with multiple erythemata migrantia. Treatment of impetigo in children requires consideration of concomitant diseases, the specific pathogen as well as local resistance patterns. Recently retapamulin has been released as a new antibiotic for topical use in impetigo contagiosa. Perianal streptococcal disease has been underdiagnosed and is an important differential diagnosis of perianal skin disease in children. Diagnosis is made by culturing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; a 2-week course of oral penicillin represents the treatment of choice.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolidinone derivatives of steroid as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives were prepared by the multi-step reactions of steroid. It is prepared from steroidal thiosemicarbazones with ethyl bromoacetate in dioxane. Steroidal thiosemicarbazones were prepared by the reaction of thiosemicarbazide with steroidal ketones. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, Fab mass spectrometries and their purities were confirmed by elemental analyses. The antibacterial activity of these compounds was evaluated by the disk diffusion assay against two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of compounds was determined. The results showed that steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives are better in inhibiting the growth as compared to steroidal thiosemicarbazone derivatives of both types of the bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative). Compounds 7 and 8 are better antibacterial agents as compared to standard drug Amoxicillin.
TI  - Activity of the new cephalosporin ceftaroline against bacteraemia isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The activity of ceftaroline, a novel cephalosporin, was evaluated against 1337 isolates from patients with bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalisation (including 119 Haemophilus influenzae, 9 Moraxella catarrhalis, 164 Staphylococcus aureus, 1007 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 38 Streptococcus pyogenes). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, and susceptibility category assessments were made using CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakpoints. Ceftaroline MICs were < or = 0.008-0.06 mg/L against H. influenzae, 0.25-2mg/L against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 0.06-1mg/L against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, 0.015-0.5mg/L against M. catarrhalis and < or = 0.008-0.5mg/L against S. pneumoniae, and all S. pyogenes isolates had ceftaroline MICs < or = 0.008mg/L. Ceftaroline was more active than ceftriaxone or cefepime both against MRSA and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. More than 90% of MRSA isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and levofloxacin but were susceptible to linezolid or tigecycline. A high rate of clarithromycin resistance was also observed in the pneumococci. Ceftaroline was very active in vitro against all CAP isolates, including MRSA and penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci, in contrast to the other beta-lactams tested. These data confirm ceftaroline as a new cephalosporin with enhanced anti-Gram-positive activity and suggest that ceftaroline has the potential to be a useful new agent in the treatment of CAP-associated bacteraemic infections.
TI  - Cytolysins augment superantigen penetration of stratified mucosa.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes colonize mucosal surfaces of the human body to cause disease. A group of virulence factors known as superantigens are produced by both of these organisms that allows them to cause serious diseases from the vaginal (staphylococci) or oral mucosa (streptococci) of the body. Superantigens interact with T cells and APCs to cause massive cytokine release to mediate the symptoms collectively known as toxic shock syndrome. In this study we demonstrate that another group of virulence factors, cytolysins, aid in the penetration of superantigens across vaginal mucosa as a representative nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelial surface. The staphylococcal cytolysin alpha-toxin and the streptococcal cytolysin streptolysin O enhanced penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, respectively, across porcine vaginal mucosa in an ex vivo model of superantigen penetration. Upon histological examination, both cytolysins caused damage to the uppermost layers of the vaginal tissue. In vitro evidence using immortalized human vaginal epithelial cells demonstrated that although both superantigens were proinflammatory, only the staphylococcal cytolysin alpha-toxin induced a strong immune response from the cells. Streptolysin O damaged and killed the cells quickly, allowing only a small release of IL-1beta. Two separate models of superantigen penetration are proposed: staphylococcal alpha-toxin induces a strong proinflammatory response from epithelial cells to disrupt the mucosa enough to allow for enhanced penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, whereas streptolysin O directly damages the mucosa to allow for penetration of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and possibly viable streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Microbial aetiology of acute clinical mastitis and agent-specific risk factors.
AB  - A nation wide study on the microbial aetiology of cases of acute clinical mastitis in Swedish dairy cows was conducted with the aim to investigate changes in the microbial panorama compared to a previous study performed 1994-1995. Another aim was to investigate some agent-specific environmental and individual risk factors. Milk samples were collected from 987 udder quarter cases from 829 cows during six 2-month periods from May 2002 to April 2003, and data on risk factors and demography were collected at sampling by means of a questionnaire. In total, 1056 bacteriological diagnoses were made. The most frequently isolated bacterial species was Staphylococcus aureus constituting 21.3% of the diagnoses, followed by Escherichia coli (15.9%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (15.6%), Streptococcus uberis (11.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6.2%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (6.1%) and Klebsiella spp. (4.2%). Samples with no growth or contamination constituted 10.6% and 4.5% of the diagnoses, respectively. A major shift in the panorama of udder pathogens was not observed compared to the survey in 1994-1995. Isolation of Klebsiella spp. was strongly associated with the use of sawdust as bedding material. On the other hand, using sawdust as bedding reduced the risk of isolating S. uberis relative to using straw or peat. The risk of isolating E. coli increased with increasing milk yield and was higher in loose housing systems than in tie stalls. Isolation of S. aureus was associated with tie stalls, and A. pyogenes with low yielding cows and teat lesions. S. dysgalactiae infections were also associated with teat lesions.
TI  - [Multiple peritonsillar abscesses caused by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum in a young female].
AB  - HISTORY: A 20-year-old previously healthy woman presented with a four-week history of sore throat and inability to swallow. INVESTIGATION AND DIAGNOSIS: Initial examination revealed tender swelling and exudation of both palatine tonsils, trismus and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, but unremarkable Epstein-Barr virus titers. COURSE AND TREATMENT: The patient was unsuccessfully treated for three days with topical antiseptics and systemic cefuroxime. Cervical magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) disclosed multiple peritonsillar abscesses. For this reason a bilateral tonsillectomy was performed. Aerobic cultures of the surgical specimens revealed the exclusive presence of Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. The patient's condition improved rapidly after surgery, with continued administration of cefuroxim. CONCLUSIONS: Peritonsillar abscesses are potentially life-threatening complications of a pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Regularly, a mixed microbial flora including Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes and anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium can be isolated from abscess material. Because of the virulence of the involved microorganisms and the proximity of the jugular vein and the carotid sheath, Lemierre syndrome may develop (throat infection followed by anaerobic septicaemia). Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is responsible for fewer than one percent of all pharyngotonsillitis cases. The infection is clinically indistinguishable from S. pyogenes or Epstein-Barr virus infections. Any removed specimen should be cultured on media supporting growth of fastidious bacteria and under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Because of its inconspicuous colony morphology, Arcanobacterium may be wrongly identified as physiological microflora and it is therefore probably underreported as a cause of pharyngotonsillitis and associated complications.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: SENTRY surveillance program, Spain (2002-2006)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
TI  - Novel biaryl oxazolidinones: in vitro and in vivo activities with pharmacokinetics in an animal model.
AB  - RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276, the new investigational oxazolidinones, have an extended spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive pathogens and showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) lower than comparator drugs. MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) values of RBx 1000075, RBx 1000276 and linezolid against the isolates tested were, respectively: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.25, 1 and 2 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 0.5, 1 and 2 microg/mL; and enterococci, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL. Against respiratory pathogens, MIC(90) values were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL. In vivo efficacies of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were evaluated in murine systemic infection against S. aureus (MRSA 562) and in a pulmonary infection model against S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303. In murine systemic infection, RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 showed efficacy against MRSA 562, exhibiting a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 6.25 and 9.92 mg/kg body weight for once-daily administration and 4.96 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight for twice-daily administration, respectively, whereas for linezolid the corresponding ED(50) values were 9.9 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight. In pulmonary infection with S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303, 50% survival was observed with RBx 1000075 at 50mg/kg once daily, whereas 60% survival was observed with RBx 1000276 at 50mg/kg thrice daily. The absolute oral bioavailabilities of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were 48% and 73%, with half-lives of 13.5 and 3.2h, respectively. RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 are promising investigational oxazolidinones against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Cochlospermum planchoni Hook.f. ex Planch essential oil from Burkina Faso.
AB  - The water distilled oil obtained from rhizomes of Cochlospermum planchonii Hook.f.ex Planch (Apocynaceae) from Burkina Faso was examined by GC and GC/MS. Cochlospermum planchonii oil presents a particular chemical composition with a high rate of oxygenated components with predominance of ketones and esters (86.4%). The essential oil was tested against twelve strains of bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The results suggest that Cochlospermum planchonii essential oil has significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - Experiences in prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in Slovenia.
AB  - During 1991-1999 a significant increase of consumption of macrolides and fluoroquinolones was observed in Slovenia,and this was associated with significant increase of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes to macrolides and Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones, respectively.Between 1999 and 2007 the prevalence of S. pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin increased from 3.7% to 16.8% even though the use of macrolides in the same period decreased from 3.81 to 2.43 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants and per day. The co-resistance and the spread of resistant clones were the reason for constant increase in macrolide resistance. Slovenia is one of the few European countries with decreasing prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospital care during the last years. As a result of control measures introduced in 1999,the MRSA prevalence rates decreased from 21.4% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2007.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Empyema: bacterial epidemiology and antibiotic resistance].
AB  - It is essential to know the epidemiology and resistance to antibiotics of the main pathogens responsible for children empyema because the bacteriological diagnosis is reached in less than half the cases. This diagnosis can be improved when using sophisticated methods of investigation, such as antigens detection, PCR... The main species involved is Streptococcus pneumoniae, then followed by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus. The pneumococcal serotypes most often involved in France are 1, 19A, 14 and 3. If some of them remain susceptible to penicillin (1,3), others may be resistant (19A, 14) and the majority are not included in the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
TI  - [Managing children skin and soft tissue infections].
AB  - The skin infections are common in pediatrics, ranging from furonculosis or impetigo to the severe forms of necrotizing dermohypodermitis. The general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. Two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. The two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. Soon, a third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these. For uncomplicated superficial skin infections justifying an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate offers the best guarantee of efficiency. Poor pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic must lead to not prescribe oral M penicillins. In case of allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin, a macrolide (if the susceptibility of the strain was checked) or pristinamycine (after 6 years of age) are acceptable alternatives. For dermohypodermitis bacterial antibiotic of choice remains amoxicillin-clavulanate through IV route, to be active against S. pyogenes but also S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The IV route is maintained until regression general signs and a relay orally by the same drug is then possible. For toxinic syndromes and necrozing fascitis clindamycin should be added to a beta-lactam because of its action on protein synthesis in particular reducing the toxins production.
TI  - [Bacteriology of cutaneous infections of the child].
AB  - Two bacterial species are responsible for the majority of children skin infections: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. If S. pyogenes remain susceptible to the beta-lactams, their resistance to macrolides varies over time but remains significant (> 10%). In France, most resistant strains are by modification of the target, coded by the gene erm b. For S. aureus, almost all strains isolated were resistant to G and A penicillins, but remain susceptible to M penicillin and cephalosporins. In France, the incidence of methicillin resistant community acquired S. aureus strains is currently low, around 6 %, but the risk of a rapid increase is real.
TI  - [The practice guideline 'Bacterial skin infections' (first revision) from the Dutch College of General Practitioners; a response from the perspective of dermatology].
AB  - We reviewed the first revision of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of bacterial skin infections developed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. Bacterial skin infections are subdivided into superficial and deep infections; the former are often treated locally while the latter may require systemic antibiotics or surgical intervention. The rate of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community is relatively low in The Netherlands, but the guideline provides recommendations, such as the restricted use of mupirocin ointment, to facilitate future MRSA control measures. Clinical distinction between erysipelas and cellulitis is often impossible; therefore, the term cellulitis is used throughout the guideline and refers to both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The first line of therapy for cellulitis remains a small spectrum, beta-lactamase resistant penicillin, such as flucloxacillin for 10 days. There are no conclusive studies on the prevention of recurrent cellulitis, so recommendations are based on expert opinion and pathophysiological considerations. The lack of rigorous and controlled studies often precludes making clear evidence-based recommendations. However, this guideline succeeds remarkably well in combining the available evidence and formulating sound practical management advice for bacterial skin infections in primary care in The Netherlands. It deserves widespread implementation among general practitioners.
TI  - Quantum dots as enhancers of the efficacy of bacterial lethal photosensitization.
AB  - Because of the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics there is considerable interest in light-activated antimicrobial agents (LAAAs) as alternatives to antibiotics for treating localized infections. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QD) could enhance the antibacterial activity of the LAAA, toluidine blue O (TBO). Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to white light (3600 lux) and TBO (absorbance maximum = 630 nm) in the presence and absence of 25 nm diameter QD (emission maximum = 627 nm). When the TBO:QD ratio was 2667:1, killing of Staph. aureus was enhanced by 1.72log(10) units. In the case of Strep. pyogenes, an enhanced kill of 1.55log(10) units was achieved using TBO and QD in the ratio 267:1. Singlet oxygen and fluorescence measurements showed that QD suppress the formation of singlet oxygen from TBO and that QD fluorescence is significantly quenched in the presence of TBO (70-90%). Enhanced killing appears to be attributable to a non-Forster resonance energy transfer mechanism, whereby the QD converts part of the incident light to the absorption maximum for TBO; hence more light energy is harvested, resulting in increased concentrations of bactericidal radicals. QD may, therefore, be useful in improving the efficacy of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.
TI  - Spotlight on retapamulin in impetigo and other uncomplicated superficial skin infections.
AB  - Topical retapamulin (Altabax, Altargo) is the first pleuromutilin antibacterial approved for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes in patients aged > or = 9 months. In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cephalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.
TI  - The bacterial superantigen and superantigen-like proteins.
AB  - SUMMARY: The bacterial superantigens are protein toxins that bind to major histocompatibility complex class II and T-cell receptor to stimulate large numbers of T cells. The majority are produced by the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and are the causative agents in toxic shock syndrome, an acute disease caused by the sudden and massive release of T-cell cytokines into the blood stream. The structure and function of the superantigens has revealed a common architecture that is also shared by another group of staphylococcal virulence factors called the superantigen-like proteins (SSL). Together, this family of structurally related molecules highlights how a common pathogenic organism has employed a simple but adaptable protein to generate an armamentarium of potent defense molecules designed to target of the innate and adaptive immune response.
TI  - Beta-defensin antibiotic peptides in the innate immunity of the buffalo: in vivo  and in vitro studies.
AB  - Beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional biomolecules, which are  a major component of the oxygen-independent microbicidal system of buffalo polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. They have great potential for use as proteomic biomarkers of host cell responses in the presence of microbial agents. On purifying these peptides by RP-HPLC, four defensin peptides were revealed. The results from testing against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Rinderpest Virus (RPV) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), showed that the peptides possessed antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values varied according to the peptide amounts and the exposure time. Furthermore, an increase in the levels of these cationic antimicrobial peptides was apparent in milk obtained from natural cases of mastitis, as compared to the levels in normal milk. MALDI-TOF-based amino acid sequencing confirmed the expression of two beta-defensins (LAP and BNBD-2) in mastitis milk. A comparison of peptide sequences revealed that buffalo LAP and BNBD-2 share 98.6% and 100% sequence identity, respectively, with those of cattle. In vitro, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) infection was shown to induce the expression of the beta-defensin gene, as evidenced by the PCR amplification of cDNA with specific primers. The determination of the enhanced expression of beta-defensin peptides in mastitis milk and in PMN cells, can be considered as an advanced approach to the assessment of cellular and molecular responses to cell injury. It is hoped that in vitro studies on phagocytes such as PMN cells and other cell lines, will eventually replace the use of animals in elucidating the roles of these cytokines in response to microbe-derived cell damage. It will also be possible to use defensins as biomarkers to correlate failure in host cell defence systems with peptide heterogeneity.
TI  - [Soft-tissue infections].
AB  - One of the soft-tissue infections with a large clinical relevance is necrotizing  fascitis produced by Streptococcus pyogenes and skin infections produced by Staphylococcus aureus, particularly due to the evermore frequent methylcillin (MRSA) resistant varieties. In necrotizing fascitis the diagnostic delay as well as the delay in the indication for surgical debridement influence both the prognosis and a high mortality related to these infections. Two clinical forms have been described: Type I caused by at least one anaerobic species in combination with facultative anaerobes, more frequent in diabetics or patients with peripheral vascular disease; type II, monomicrobial, produced by group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus and with a lesser frequency by Staphylococcus aureus. Among the recognized risk factors diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic renal failure, alcoholism, cancer, malnutrition, steroid and/or immunosuppressant treatment and the use of intravenous parenteral drugs are widely recognized. Therapeutics is based on hemodynamic support, antibiotic therapy and an early surgical approach with the elimination of all of the necrotic and devitalized tissue. Infections frequently associated to community-acquired MRSA are those present in skin and soft-tissue. Some population groups have been described as at-risk, but there is also an increase in the number of patients with no risk factors. Also, national and international registries of anti-TNF therapies have demonstrated the increase of soft-tissue infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with these agents. Other biologic drugs such as rituximab, abatacept or anakinra do not seem to be associated to an increase in these infections.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - The role of adenoids in pediatric rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adenoids' importance in pediatric rhinosinusitis as a cause of mechanical blockage or as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data was performed, which included 410 children under the age of 14 who underwent adenoidectomy in the study. Adenoid bacteriology was evaluated with adenoid tissue culture, and sinusitis grade and adenoid size were determined using preoperative PNS X-ray. A potential correlation between these factors was then analyzed. RESULTS: The overall adenoid bacteria isolation rate was 79.3%. The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenza (28.5%), Streptococcus pneumonia (21.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (21.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (15.6%), and bacterial isolation rate increased significantly according to sinusitis grade (p=0.000). This was especially true of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumonia, whose isolation rates increased significantly (p=0.011, p=0.001 each). There was no statistically significant difference in sinusitis grade or bacterial isolation rate according to adenoid size. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, adenoids contain many potentially pathogenic bacteria. We suggest that in pediatric rhinosinusitis, adenoids act as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria rather than as a barrier causing mechanical obstruction.
TI  - Biofilms in skin infections: Propionibacterium acnes and acne vulgaris.
AB  - It is generally accepted that many human infections are biofilm-related and that  sessile (biofilm-grown) cells are highly resistant against antimicrobial agents. Propionibacterium acnes plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, a common disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and it has been suggested that P. acnes cells residing within the follicles grow as a biofilm. Although P. acnes biofilms have not been observed directly in the pilosebaceous unit, the observation that P. acnes readily forms biofilm in vitro as well as on various medical devices in vivo, combined with the high resistance of sessile P. acnes cells and the increased production of particular virulence factors and qourum sensing molecules in sessile cells point in this direction. In addition, in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation has also been demonstrated for other microorganisms involved in skin diseases (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes).
TI  - Acute paediatric neck abscesses.
AB  - Acute neck swellings in a paediatric setting are often treated with antibiotics,  proceeding to incision and drainage if an abscess is suspected. A variety of investigations are available and the causative organism can vary. A five-year retrospective study analysing trends in microbiology, antibiotic sensitivity, clinical evaluation and management of children presenting with an acute cervical abscess of four weeks duration or less was performed. The case notes of 175 children admitted between January 1996 and December 2000 to the acute surgical admission unit at the Royal Hospital of Sick Children, Glasgow were studied. During this period there were 90 males and 85 females with a mean age of three years (range: one month to 13 years). One hundred and twenty three (70%) children underwent surgery with pus being confirmed in 114 (93%) of cases. Ultrasound was performed in 70 (40%) patients with 48 proceeding to surgery. Positive culture of pus from abscess cavities revealed Staphylococcus aureus in 46% (85% sensitive to both flucloxacillin and erythromycin) and Streptococcus pyogenes in 15% (80% sensitive to penicillin and 75% to erythromycin). The role of investigations and the available treatment options are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and antibacterial activities of novel 3,6-bicyclolide oximes:  length optimization and zero carbon linker oximes.
AB  - We designed and synthesized a series of novel 3,6-bicyclolide oximes, possessing  linkers of varying lengths to the secondary binding site. The E isomers exhibited excellent antibacterial profiles against a broad spectrum of resistant pathogens.
TI  - Proposed MIC and disk diffusion microbiological cutoffs and spectrum of activity  of retapamulin, a novel topical antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. MICs were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. Population distribution and MIC versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological MIC cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. The retapamulin MIC(90) against 234 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. Retapamulin MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 Streptococcus pyogenes, 103 Streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group C Streptococcus, and 71 group G Streptococcus isolates. The MIC(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. Retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the Enterococcus species tested. Based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, MICs of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. For beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only MIC of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.
TI  - Synthesis of novel benzo[h]quinolines: wound healing, antibacterial, DNA binding  and in vitro antioxidant activity.
AB  - We have characterized a new class of 2-mercapto/2-selenobenzo[h]quinoline-3-carbaldehyde (3/4). Antibacterial potential of these compounds against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was studied. The selenium containing compound 4 showed significant inhibition zone on Staphylococcus aureus (22.76+/-0.14), Bacillus subtilis (20.63+/-0.24), and Streptococcus pyogenes (19.54+/-0.20) over sulfur containing compound 3. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the synthetic compounds in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The interaction behavior of these compounds with DNA was investigated by absorption spectra (obtained K(b) constant for 3 is 2.7x10(5) and for 4 is 3.8x10(6)), viscosity, and thermal denaturation studies. Finally, the results show that the DNA intercalated 3/4 compounds are strong antioxidants; they show significant wound healing activity and protect oxidative DNA damage from harmful free radical reactions.
TI  - Crystal structures of fibronectin-binding sites from Staphylococcus aureus FnBPA  in complex with fibronectin domains.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus can adhere to and invade endothelial cells by binding to the human protein fibronectin (Fn). FnBPA and FnBPB, cell wall-attached proteins from S. aureus, have multiple, intrinsically disordered, high-affinity binding repeats (FnBRs) for Fn. Here, 30 years after the first report of S. aureus/Fn interactions, we present four crystal structures that together comprise the structures of two complete FnBRs, each in complex with four of the N-terminal modules of Fn. Each approximately 40-residue FnBR forms antiparallel strands along the triple-stranded beta-sheets of four sequential F1 modules ((2-5)F1) with each FnBR/(2-5)F1 interface burying a total surface area of approximately 4,300 A(2). The structures reveal the roles of residues conserved between S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes FnBRs and show that there are few linker residues between FnBRs. The ability to form large intermolecular interfaces with relatively few residues has been proposed to be a feature of disordered proteins, and S. aureus/Fn interactions provide an unusual illustration of this efficiency.
TI  - The first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from January to August 2006. With the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout Japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 Staphylococcus aureus, 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 Streptococcus pyogenes, 165 Haemophilus influenzae, 91 Moraxella catarrhalis, 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the Central Laboratory of the Research Center for Anti-infective Drugs of the Kitasato Institute, according to recommendations issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). Three (2.1%) of the 143 P. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. Through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult RTI to various antibacterial agents. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - Determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations Gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  - A novel polyenzyme formulation Gumseb developed by Advanced Enzyme Technologies Ltd, Thane and Speciality Biochemicals Co., USA, was tested for antibacterial properties using ATCC strains and clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A modified antibiotic susceptibility test was used for the purpose. S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were found to be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. Next, to study the interaction between Gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) was carried out for each organism. The assay was carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. Synergistic effect was established when Gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against S. pyogenes. Partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with Ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa and with Ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive S. aureus. Antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with Ampicillin against E. coli, with Ciprofloxacin against S. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. The results indicate that Gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of P. aerugionosa and S. aureus. These findings have particular importance since these organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. In cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. However, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and MIC could be determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. Therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. These findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of synovial fluid in the knee.
AB  - This study evaluated antimicrobial properties of synovial fluid against 3 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Synovial fluid was collected from the knees of 52 patients. Three gram-positive bacteria culture lines were incubated in wells containing either synovial fluid and broth, or broth alone. Fluid was plated and incubated, and colonies were counted after 1, 4, and 24 hours to determine bacterial growth. Statistically significant differences in bacterial counts were found between control and experimental groups at 0, 4, and 24 hours for all 3 bacterial species. Bacterial counts in the control specimens demonstrated exponential growth over 24 hours as would be expected in the absence of growth inhibition. In contrast, bacterial counts in all of the synovial fluid specimens decreased steadily over 24 hours. These results demonstrate synovial fluid possesses potent bactericidal activity against the most common gram-positive pathogens responsible for septic arthritis. Delineating these antimicrobial properties further may offer avenues to augment the body's protection against bacterial infections.
TI  - Effects of a low concentration hypochlorous Acid nasal irrigation solution on bacteria, fungi, and virus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Saline irrigation would be more effective for chronic sinusitis patients if it had bactericidal effects. Low concentrations of hypochlorous acid may be used as a nasal irrigation solution. First, we developed a 0.85% NaCl solution by adding NaCl to tap water (pH 7.0 and 8.4) and measuring the concentration of free chlorine and hypochlorous acid after giving the solution a short electrical impulse of 20 seconds. Then we investigated whether the derived hypochlorous acid had a toxic effect on human primary nasal epithelial cells, if and what effect it had on the expression of mucin genes, and, finally, if it had bactericidal, fungicidal, or virucidal effects. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biochemical experiment. METHODS: We treated human primary nasal epithelial cells with 3.5 ppm of hypochlorous acid and then examined the cells for cytotoxicity. We also investigated the bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal effects by challenging the cells with the following microorganisms Aspergillus fumigatus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. To study the virucidal effects of HOCl, we used the human influenza A virus to challenge the cells. RESULTS: : In the cytotoxicity assay and in the morphological examination, the cells did not show anytoxicity at 30 minute or 2 hours after treatment with HOCl. More than 99% of bactericidal or fungicidal activity was noted for all species, except for Candida albicans, in tap water at either pH 7.0 or 8.4. In addition, a 3.2-log10 reduction was achieved in cells challenged with the human influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS: A low concentration HOCl solution can be used as an effective nasal irrigation solution.
TI  - LambdaSa2 prophage endolysin requires Cpl-7-binding domains and amidase-5 domain  for antimicrobial lysis of streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal pathogens contribute to a wide variety of human and livestock diseases. The routine use of antibiotics to battle these pathogens has produced a new class of multidrug-resistant streptococci. Thus, there is a need for new antimicrobials. Bacteriophage endolysins (peptidoglycan hydrolases) comprise one group of new antimicrobials that are reportedly refractory to resistance development. The LambdaSa2 prophage endolysin gene was recently isolated from a Group B streptococcal genome, expressed on an Escherichia coli plasmid, and shown by homology screening and biochemical analysis to harbor an amidase-5 (endopeptidase) domain, an amidase-4 (glycosidase) domain, and two Cpl-7 cell wall-binding domains. In this study, turbidity reduction and plate lysis assays indicate that this hydrolase shows strong lytic activity toward Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus equi, GES, and GGS. Deletion analysis indicates that the N-terminal endopeptidase domain with both Cpl-7 domains can lyse with a higher specific activity than the full-length protein (against some strains). This dual Cpl-7 domain truncated version also shows weak lytic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus xylosus. The truncated constructs harboring the glycosidase domain are virtually inactive, showing only minimal activity on plate lysis assays.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Mast cells determine the magnitude of bacterial toxin-induced skin inflammation.
AB  - Mast cells are known to be important effector cells in innate immune responses to bacterial infections. However, up to now, neither the mechanisms nor the relevance of mast cell degranulation in innate skin immune responses to bacteria have been adequately addressed. In this article, we show that the bacterial toxins streptolysin O (SLO) and alpha-toxin potently induce degranulation of mast cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, intradermal injection of the toxins results in pronounced skin inflammation, which either resolves quickly within a few h (SLO-induced inflammation) or presents a chronic process with ongoing inflammation for weeks (alpha-toxin). Interestingly, mast cells mediated the inflammatory effects of SLO, but in contrast limited inflammatory skin responses to alpha-toxin. These findings further support the hypothesis that mast cells are critically involved in initiating and modulating optimal host responses to bacteria by either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the course of the host reaction induced by the pathogen.
TI  - [Colonization (infection) of the respiratory tract in outpatients in 2000-2005 years].
AB  - Infections of the respiratory tract are one of the main causes of family doctor visiting. A variety of etiological factors (mostly viruses, typical and non typical bacteria) causes that the diagnosis of these infections is rarely made in outpatient practice (usually these are nose and throat smears); additionally the carrier state of typical bacteria in the respiratory tract impedes the interpretation of microbiological results. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to assess the incidence of potential bacterial etiological factors of respiratory tract infections in outpatients in the years 2000-2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3270 microbiological results obtained from patients at the age of between 1 month and 88 years old with chronic and acute symptoms of respiratory tract infections were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive results of bacteria culture indicating the possible bacterial etiological agent of infection were found from 1051 patients (34.4%), mostly in autumn - spring time. Most often were isolated: H. influenzae - 28.8%, S. pneumoniae - 22.1% and S. aureus - 22.1%, in less percentage M. catarrhalis - 14.1% and S. pyogenes - 13.1. Positive bacteria cultures were received most often from ear secretion- 66.8% (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus), from nose-41.2% (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae), sputum - 34.9% (S. aureus), throat - 24.3% (H. influenzae, S. pyogenes). CONCLUSIONS: It has been confirmed that predominant participation of viruses in respiratory system infections is observed and also seasonal character of their bacterial nature occurrence (35%). Most often were isolated: H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, also M. catarrhalis. On the ground of carrier state of these bacteria in nasopharynx it is a clinician's decision to recognize the bacteria as the etiological agent of infection and possible use of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Application of genomics in bacterial vaccine discovery: a decade in review.
AB  - The combined power of genomics and proteomics has led to many advances in the discovery of bacterial vaccine targets. The 'Holy Grail' for a vaccine is to be pathogen specific yet conserved among all strains, so that universal coverage is possible with the minimal number of antigens. Genomics allows us to target conserved proteins, while proteomics tells us what is actually expressed and what is accessible to antibodies. Achievements using these latest approaches are exemplified by the vaccine clinical trials that are ongoing for protein targets against Neiserria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus along with promising discoveries that have been made for other pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. These developments are discussed in this review.
TI  - Recent advances in the preclinical evaluation of the topical antibacterial agent  REP8839.
AB  - REP8839 is a synthetic fluorovinylthiophene-containing diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl tRNA synthetase (MetRS) and is a new chemical entity that represents a novel pharmacological class. The compound has potent in vitro antibacterial activity against many clinically important Gram-positive bacteria including the major skin pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In light of the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the community and increasing resistance to mupirocin, REP8839 is being evaluated as a topical agent for the treatment of superficial skin infections. REP8839 was active against resistant phenotypes of S. aureus and can be formulated at high concentrations to minimize the development of resistance. A formulation of REP8839 has demonstrated efficacy in a porcine partial thickness wound infection model against mupirocin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thymus daenensis methanolic extract.
AB  - Medicinal plants are potential of antimicrobial compounds. The present study deals with the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thymus daenensis. Aerial parts of the plant were collected from Alvand mountainside (Hamadan, Iran) in May 2005, air-dried and extracted by methanol. The dried extract was redissolved in methanol to make a 100 mg/ml solution and then filtered. Antibacterial activity of the extract was evaluated against various Gram-positive and Gram-negatives bacteria using disk diffusion technique. Blank paper disks were loaded with 40 microl of the methanol solution and then dried up. The impregnated disks were placed on Mueller-Hinton agar inoculated with bacterial suspension equal to 0.5 McFarland. The extract inhibited the growth Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Entrococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, but it showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The most significant effect was seen against S.aureus including MRSA, which are important nosocomial pathogens. MIC90 of the extract was determined against Gram-positive bacteria (3.12 mg/ml) and 11 MRSA strain (1.56 mg/ml).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - [The assessment of bacterial flora and antibiotic-sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial flora of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea and of healthy people. Bacterial colonization of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions is more frequent in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea. Because antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are quite often met, it seems important to determine antibiotic-sensitivity of isolated bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 178 people underwent bacteriological examination of conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and skin lesions: 64 patients with acne vulgaris, 59 patients with rosacea and 55 healthy persons. Microorganisms were identified with laboratory techniques with the use of bio-Merieux kits and determination of drug-sensitivity was performed with recognized laboratory techniques. RESULTS: Positive cultures and general frequencies of the isolations were found to be higher in both groups in comparison with the reference group (the group of clinically healthy people). In healthy persons practically the only saprophytic bacteria--the most often S. epidermidis and S. viridans--were isolated. Whereas in patients suffering from acne vulgaris and rosacea the pathogenic bacteria--S. aureus, P. fluorescens, P. acnes, P. aeruginosa--were additionally isolated. Different spectrum of sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions in the cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea was proved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the cases of acne vulgaris the majority of isolated bacteria from conjunctival sac included Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. 2. In the severe cases of rosacea the main bacteria found in conjunctival sac were S. aureus, S.pyogenes, P.aeruginosa, E. faecalis, A. baumanii, P. fluorescens. 3. Because of changeable drug-sensitivity of bacterial strains, it seems to be necessary to perform individual culture and antibiogram in every patient with inflammatory lesions, in particular in clinically severe and resistant to therapy cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea. 4. The higher frequency of the bacterial colonisations in the conjunctival sac in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea can be a potential source of ocular infections in the cases of local and systemic disorders of protective mechanisms. 5. Estimation of bacterial flora and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions should be perform, especially when patients are prepared for eye surgery.
TI  - Lethal photosensitization of wound-associated microbes using indocyanine green and near-infrared light.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in resistance to antibiotics among disease-causing bacteria necessitates the development of alternative antimicrobial approaches such as the use of light-activated antimicrobial agents (LAAAs). Light of an appropriate wavelength activates the LAAA to produce cytotoxic species which can then cause bacterial cell death via loss of membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, the inactivation of essential enzymes, and/or exertion of mutagenic effects due to DNA modification. In this study, the effect of the LAAA indocyanine green excited with high or low intensity light (808 nm) from a near-infrared laser (NIR) on the viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. RESULTS: All species were susceptible to killing by the LAAA, the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration of indocyanine green and the light dose. Indocyanine green photosensitization using both high (1.37 W cm(-2)) and low (0.048 W cm(-2)) intensity NIR laser light was able to achieve reductions of 5.6 log10 (>99.99%) and 6.8 log10 (>99.99%) in the viable counts of Staph. aureus and Strep. pyogenes (using starting concentrations of 106-107 CFU ml(-1)). Kills of 99.99% were obtained for P. aeruginosa (initial concentration 108-109 CFU ml(-1)) photosensitized by the high intensity light (1.37 W cm(-2)); while a kill of 80% was achieved using low intensity irradiation (0.07 W cm(-2)). The effects of L-tryptophan (a singlet oxygen scavenger) and deuterium oxide (as an enhancer of the life span of singlet oxygen) on the survival of Staph. aureus was also studied. L-tryptophan reduced the proportion of Staph. aureus killed; whereas deuterium oxide increased the proportion killed suggesting that singlet oxygen was involved in the killing of the bacteria. CONCLUSION: These findings imply that indocyanine green in combination with light from a near-infrared laser may be an effective means of eradicating bacteria from wounds and burns.
TI  - [Prevalence of Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the pharynx of healthy children in the town of Gardabaer].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating S. pyogenes pharyngitis with antibiotics is recommended after confirming its presence using culture or rapid antigen tests. Limiting unnecessary antibiotics use is important in attempt to avoid rising resistance to drugs such as macrolides. Not all individuals carrying S. pyogenes are infected. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the carriage rate of S. pyogenes and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) among healthy children in the Reykjavik capital area. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study for the carriage of S. pyogenes and MRSA among healthy children in the town of Gardabaer. The study took place in March and April 2005. Throat cultures were collected from 270 asymptomatic healthy primary school students and cultured selectively for S. pyogenes and MRSA and tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities. RESULTS: Prevalence of S. pyogenes was found to be 22%. The proportion of carriers in 1st to 6th grade was 28%, compared with 11% in 7th to 10th grade students. The highest proportion was in 1st grade, 45%. The proportion S. pyogenes resistant to erythromycin was 17%, to tetracycline 13% and clindamycin 2%. All strains were susceptible to penicillin. No MRSA strains were found. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a high S. pyogenes carriage rate in primary school children in Garethabaer. Physicians should consider the prevalence of streptococcal carriage when diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis in children, and only perform culture and/or antigen tests when clinically indicated.
TI  - Changing trends in acute osteomyelitis in children: impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus remains the most common etiologic agent of acute osteomyelitis in children. Recently, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a major pathogen. METHODS: Records of all children admitted with acute osteomyelitis from January 1999 to December 2003 were reviewed. For the comparative analysis, the study population was evenly distributed in 2 periods: period A, January 1999 to June 2001; n = 113; and period B, July 2001 to December 2003; n = 177. In addition, clinical findings of MRSA osteomyelitis were compared with non-MRSA osteomyelitis, including methicillin-sensitive S. aureus infections. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety children (60% male subjects) with acute osteomyelitis were identified. Median (25th-75th percentile) age at diagnosis was 6 years (range, 2-11 years). Significant clinical findings included the following: localized pain (84%), fever (67%), and swelling (62%). Affected bones included the following: foot (23%), femur (20%), tibia (16%), and pelvis (7%). Thirty-seven percent of blood cultures were positive, and a bacterial isolate was obtained in 55% of cases. Bacteria most frequently isolated included the following: methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (45%) (57% in period Avs 40% in period B), MRSA (23%) (6% in A vs 31% in B; P < 0.001), Streptococcus pyogenes (6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%). Children with MRSA compared with those with non-MRSA osteomyelitis had significantly greater erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values on admission and increased length of hospital stay, antibiotic therapy, and overall rate of complications. We observed significant changes in antibiotic therapy related to increased use of agents with activity against MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated more frequently in the second study period and was associated with worse clinical outcomes.
TI  - Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients with psoriasis possess genes that code for toxins (superantigens): clinical and therapeutic implications.
AB  - Superantigens are powerful T lymphocyte-stimulating agents that are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as psoriasis. Toxins produced by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are superantigens. The aim of this study was to detect genes that code for superantigens in Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus isolates from psoriatic patients. Primers to amplify streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, B, and C and streptolysin O genes and staphylococcal enterotoxin A, B, C, and D genes were used. Streptococcal exotoxin B was detected in five streptococcal isolates. Staphyloccocus aureus enterotoxin A and/or C genes were detected in nine S. aureus isolates. Isolates from 13 of 22 patients possesed gene(s) that code for toxin(s) (superantigens). These results might support the role of superantigens in the exacerbation of psoriasis.
TI  - In vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. In this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Entecoccus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. Ciprofloxacine discs (CIP, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: No inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. Ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of E. coli. The inhibition rates of Ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of CIP. Whereas MIC and MBC values of ketamine for S. aureus and S. pyogenes were 500 microg mL(-1), MIC and MBC values for P. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg mL(-1). For other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. We thought that it will be proper to use ketamine hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of mometasone furoate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antibacterial properties of the topical corticoid mometasone furoate, which is used as a nasal spray. DESIGN: The activity of mometasone (0.01%, 0.1%, and 0.5%) in buffer solution against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus milleri was tested by quantitative killing assays. SETTING: In vitro study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reduction of viable bacteria and fungi in quantitative killing assays. RESULTS: Mometasone (0.5%) reduced viable counts of S pyogenes and S milleri by 99.99% and 99.00%, respectively, after 24 hours of incubation, whereas colony-forming units (CFUs) of S aureus, P aeruginosa, and E coli were not affected by the corticoid. Mometasone (0.1%) caused a decrease in CFUs of S pyogenes of 99.90% to 99.99%, while it led to a 99.00% reduction in CFUs of S milleri, but only if low bacterial counts of 1 x 10(4) CFUs/mL were incubated. By contrast, the use of mometasone at a low concentration (0.01%) demonstrated an increase in CFUs of S milleri if the baseline bacterial count was low (1 x 10(4) CFUs/mL). CONCLUSION: Mometasone demonstrates antimicrobial activity against streptococci.
TI  - Factors that affect the clinical course of group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal  infections of the hand and upper extremity: a retrospective study.
AB  - Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus is a well-known cause of necrotising fasciitis, which is increasing in incidence and severity. More aggressive soft tissue infections of the hand and upper extremity caused by this organism have been noted in our plastic surgical unit, prompting a five-year retrospective study to find out which factors affect clinical outcomes. The records of 31 patients, 27 male and 4 female, with Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal soft tissue infections with a mean (SD) age of 25 (12) years were reviewed. Twenty-seven infections followed injuries, while four were spontaneous. Six patients required more than two operations to clear the infection, and one required free tissue transfer for closure of the resulting soft tissue deficit. Of the variables age, number of cigarettes consumed daily, interval from the date of injury to the date of presentation, coexisting infection with Staphylococcus aureus, and grade of infection at presentation, only the last correlated with the patients' clinical course (p<0.001). Those patients with spontaneous infections with pre-existing medical conditions had a worse prognosis, requiring more operations and a longer stay in hospital. A multicentre prospective study would be useful to confirm these findings.
TI  - The human CXC chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (GCP-2)/CXCL6 possesses membrane-disrupting properties and is antibacterial.
AB  - Granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (GCP-2)/CXCL6 is a CXC chemokine expressed by macrophages and epithelial and mesenchymal cells during inflammation. Through binding and activation of its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), it exerts neutrophil-activating and angiogenic activities. Here we show that GCP-2/CXCL6 itself is antibacterial. Antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria of relevance to mucosal infections was seen at submicromolar concentrations (minimal bactericidal concentration at which 50% of strains tested were killed, 0.063 +/- 0.01 to 0.37 +/- 0.03 muM). In killed bacteria, GCP-2/CXCL6 associated with bacterial surfaces, which showed membrane disruption and leakage. A structural prediction indicated the presence of three antiparallel NH(2)-terminal beta-sheets and a short amphipathic COOH-terminal alpha-helix; the latter feature is typical of antimicrobial peptides. However, when the synthetic derivatives corresponding to the NH(2)-terminal (50 amino acids) and COOH-terminal (19 amino acids, corresponding to the putative alpha-helix) regions were compared, higher antibacterial activity was observed for the NH(2)-terminus-derived peptide, indicating that the holopeptide is necessary for full antibacterial activity. An artificial model of bacterial membranes confirmed these findings. The helical content of GCP-2/CXCL6 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or negatively charged membranes was studied by circular dichroism. As with many antibacterial peptides, membrane disruption by GCP-2/CXCL6 was dose-dependently reduced in the presence of NaCl, which, we here demonstrate, inhibited the binding of the peptide to the bacterial surface. Compared with CXC chemokines ENA-78/CXCL5 and NAP-2/CXCL7, GCP-2/CXCL6 showed a 90-fold-higher antibacterial activity. Taken together, GCP/CXCL6, in addition to its chemotactic and angiogenic properties, is likely to contribute to direct antibacterial activity during localized infection.

TI  - Frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of Streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 Streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. Detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types I, II, III and IV were carried out by PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. In addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. There was a high phenotypic diversity; some Streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other Streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (I-IV). There was no positive correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (Spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, P>0.05). In conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.
TI  - Retapamulin: a review of its use in the management of impetigo and other uncomplicated superficial skin infections.
AB  - Topical retapamulin (Altabax, Altargo) is the first pleuromutilin antibacterial approved for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (excluding meticillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes in patients aged > or = 9 months. In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cefalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both paediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.
TI  - Synthesis, spectral characterization, in vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes with 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases.
AB  - A series of metal complexes of cobalt(II), nickel(II) and copper(II) have been synthesized with newly synthesized biologically active 1,2,4-triazole Schiff bases derived from the condensation of 3-substituted-4-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole and 8-formyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, which have been characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic measurements (IR, UV-vis, fluorescence, ESR), magnetic measurements and thermal studies. Electrochemical study of the complexes is also reported. All the complexes are soluble to limited extent in common organic solvents but soluble to larger extent in DMF and DMSO and are non-electrolytes in DMF and DMSO. All these Schiff bases and their complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Cladosporium) by MIC method. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Increased surface toll-like receptor 2 expression in superantigen shock.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examination of the interaction between gram-positive bacterial superantigens and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in health and critical illness. DESIGN: Laboratory ex vivo model and prospective clinical, cohort study. SETTING: Two research laboratories in university hospitals and two intensive care units. SUBJECTS/PATIENTS: Laboratory study was performed in transfected HeLa cells and primary human monocytes from healthy volunteers. Clinical study used cells from 20 healthy controls and 45 critically ill patients with circulatory shock. INTERVENTIONS: HeLa cells and purified monocytes were exposed to purified superantigens or isogenic bacterial supernatants and readout obtained by cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with circulatory shock were compared with controls using flow cytometry and measurement of cytokines after ligand exposure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Superantigens were unable to signal through ligation by TLR2. However, TLR2 was up-regulated on the surface of primary human monocytes, without detectable TLR2 messenger RNA neosynthesis, by a range of superantigens and superantigen-containing Streptococcus pyogenes supernatants, although not by isogenic superantigen-negative strains. Superantigen mutant constructs with disrupted major histocompatibility complex class II-binding sites did not support TLR2 up-regulation. TLR2 up-regulation was associated with an increase in the proinflammatory response to TLR2 ligands only at high ligand concentrations. TLR2 was up-regulated in a small subset of patients with severe S. pyogenes sepsis but not in patients with any other category of septic or circulatory shock; responses to TLR2 ligands were reduced in all categories of critically ill patient, however. CONCLUSIONS: Superantigens up-regulate monocyte surface TLR2 expression through major histocompatibility complex class II signaling. Enhanced surface TLR2 expression may be a specific feature of patients with S. pyogenes-induced shock. Importantly, intensity of TLR2 signaling is not necessarily coupled to TLR2 expression when ligand concentrations are low or after onset of critical illness.
TI  - [Availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in Italian hospitals].
AB  - To assess the availability of laboratory tools for microbiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection, a survey was conducted on a sample of Italian hospital laboratories during the period April-July 2005. Overall, 261 hospitals, one third of the total Italian hospitals, were randomly selected. All these laboratories were sent a standardized questionnaire collecting information on diagnostic tools available for testing a list of bacterial, viral and fungal organisms responsible for lower respiratory tract infections. Forty eight percent of the sample completed and returned the questionnaire. A part from few pathogens such as Enterobacteria, Enterococcus Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Herpes simplex e Candida spp, for which no differences in diagnostic capacity among hospitals was found, for all the other pathogens considered, significant differences among geographical areas were found.
TI  - Gene amelioration demonstrated: the journey of nascent genes in bacteria.
AB  - Gene amelioration is the hypothesis that genes acquired via lateral gene transfer will, over time, acquire the molecular characteristics of the host genome. Species for which multiple strains have been sequenced permit a demonstration that this hypothesis is correct. We use 7 sequenced genomes of Streptococcus pyogenes and 6 sequenced genomes of Staphylococcus aureus to illustrate the action of amelioration on these genomes.
TI  - Functional Fe3O4/TiO2 core/shell magnetic nanoparticles as photokilling agents for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A photokilling approach for pathogenic bacteria is demonstrated using a new type  of magnetic nanoprobe as the photokilling agent. In addition to their magnetic property, the nanoprobes have other features including a photocatalytic property and the capacity to target bacteria. The nanoprobes comprise iron oxide/titania (Fe(3)O(4)@TiO(2)) core/shell magnetic nanoparticles. As dopamine molecules can self-assemble onto the surface of the titania substrate, dopamine is used as the linker to immobilize succinic anhydride onto the surfaces of the Fe(3)O(4)@TiO(2) nanoparticles. This is followed by the immobilization of IgG via amide bonding. We demonstrate that the IgG-Fe(3)O(4)@TiO(2) magnetic nanoparticles not only have the capacity to target several pathogenic bacteria, but they also can effectively inhibit the cell growth of the bacteria targeted by the nanoparticles under irradiation of a low-power UV lamp within a short period. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, such as multiantibiotic-resistant S. pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.
TI  - Superantigens SPEA and SMEZ do not affect secretome expression in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The superantigens, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), were recently reported to repress global exoprotein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. To investigate if this phenomenon could be observed in a different Gram-positive pathogen, the effects of two major Streptococcus pyogenes superantigens on streptococcal secretome expression were examined. Using mutagenesis and genetic complementation, we demonstrated that neither streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) nor streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ) had any consistent effect on global protein expression or on transcription of genes encoding the secreted exoproteins, DNase B, SPEB and SPEG. In S. pyogenes, superantigen production does not appear to have a major regulatory role.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of heyneanol A extracted from the root of Taiwanese wild grape.
AB  - AIMS: To search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (Vitis spp.). To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against Gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. After purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol A by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Heyneanol A showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards MRSA and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the contents of heyneanol A were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. CONCLUSIONS: The root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of Gram-positive pathogens. Heyneanol A, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards MRSA. In addition, the abundances of heyneanol A and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. The results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against MRSA.
TI  - Baseline in vitro activity of tigecycline among key bacterial pathogens exhibiting multidrug resistance.
AB  - Tigecycline is the first clinically available semisynthetic glycylcycline approved for clinical use. This study was done to establish a baseline for ongoing surveillance of tigecycline's activity as this agent's clinical use increases. Against 1,796 Staphylococcus aureus (559 multidrug resistant), tigecycline had the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90); 0.12 microg/ml) among all agents tested and 99.8% of the isolates were susceptible. For Acinetobacter spp., tigecycline again demonstrated the lowest MIC(90) (2 microg/ml) and the highest percent susceptibility (96.9%). Among Enterobacteriaceae, the 2 most active agents were tigecycline (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99% susceptible) and imipenem (MIC(90) = 1 microg/ml; 99.5% susceptible). Tigecycline also demonstrated high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes,Haemophilus influenzae and Enterococcus spp. In summary, tigecycline currently exhibits potent activity against a broad array of bacteria species. Given the dynamics of resistance development, careful monitoring of tigecycline activity against these organisms should remain a significant aspect of ongoing surveillance.

TI  - Evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  - The present trial was conducted in Hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. Rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. All rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. In outdoor sows Escherichia (E.) coli and Actinobaculum (A.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. Besides E. coli and A. suis, Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (Staphylococcus (S.) albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. were concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were concurrently found beside E. coli and A. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. In indoor sows E. coli and A. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were found beside E. coli and A. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. However only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (S. albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. IMPLICATIONS: in Eastern European climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.
TI  - Associated antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 39 425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). In all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. Irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. Thus, trimethoprim resistance in E. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in Strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. In all five species investigated, there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. For the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. For the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.
TI  - [Kawasaki disease and infection].
AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multisystemic vasculitis. Although some infectious agents are highly suspected the etiology of KD remains unknown. Various bacteria such as, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis have been implicated in etiology of KD. However, modern molecular techniques failed to identify the positive relation between these agents and etiology of KD. Recently, one hypothesis suggests that superantigens (TSS-1, SEB, SEC, SPEB, SPEC), which are produced by streptococci and staphylococci, play an important role in the cause of KD. Although several studies show that superantigens, mainly bacterial toxins and viral antigens, are involved in causing some diseases, there is no obvious evidence that superantigens are able to induce KD. Host-derived factor as well as infectious agents should be investigated to understand the immunopathogenesis of KD.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (Ply700) from Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. A prophage was isolated from a strain of Streptococcus uberis (ATCC 700407) following exposure to mitomycin C. Partial sequencing of the phage DNA revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. The putative lysin (Ply700) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. Addition of the purified Ply700 to bacterial suspensions of S. uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, or E. coli. Killing of S. uberis in milk by Ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. Activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (P<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (P<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. In contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. Functional characterization of the C-terminal domain, as a component of a GFP fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to S. uberis. The C-terminal domain may have utility in targeting S. uberis while it remains to be determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of S. uberis mastitis.
TI  - Epidemiology of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis in tropical communities, Northern Australia.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (groups C and G streptococci [GCS/GGS]) is an increasingly recognized human pathogen, although it may follow indirect pathways. Prospective surveillance of selected households in 3 remote Aboriginal communities in Australia provided 337 GCS/GGS isolates that were emm sequence-typed. Lancefield group C isolates (GCS) were localized to specific households and group G isolates (GGS) were more evenly distributed. GCS/GGS was more frequently recovered from the throat than group A streptococci (GAS [S. pyogenes]) but rarely recovered from skin sores, and then only with Staphylococcus aureus or GAS. Symptomatic GGS/GGC pharyngitis was also rare. Specific emm sequence types of GCS/GGS did not appear to cycle through the communities (sequential strain replacement) in a manner suggesting acquisition of type-specific immunity. These communities already have high levels of streptococcal and poststreptococcal disease. GCS/GGS may increase in importance as it acquires key virulence factors from GAS by lateral gene transfer.
TI  - Phagocytosis-independent antimicrobial activity of mast cells by means of extracellular trap formation.
AB  - These days it has been increasingly recognized that mast cells (MCs) are critical components of host defense against pathogens. In this study, we have provided the first evidence that MCs can kill bacteria by entrapping them in extracellular structures similar to the extracellular traps described for neutrophils (NETs). We took advantage of the ability of MCs to kill the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes by a phagocytosis-independent mechanism in order to characterize the extracellular antimicrobial activity of MCs. Close contact of bacteria and MCs was required for full antimicrobial activity. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that S pyogenes was entrapped by extracellular structures produced by MCs (MCETs), which are composed of DNA, histones, tryptase, and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Disruption of MCETs significantly reduced the antimicrobial effect of MCs, suggesting that intact extracellular webs are critical for effective inhibition of bacterial growth. Similar to NETs, production of MCETs was mediated by a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cell death mechanism accompanied by disruption of the nuclear envelope, which can be induced after stimulation of MCs with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), H(2)O(2), or bacterial pathogens. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of antimicrobial extracellular traps formation by an immune cell population other than neutrophils.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of amblyone isolated from Amorphophallus campanulatus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of amblyone, a triterpenoid isolated from Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb). METHODS: Disc diffusion technique was used for in vitro antibacterial and antifungal screening. Cytotoxicity was determined against brine shrimp nauplii. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using serial dilution technique to determine the antibacterial potency. RESULTS: Large zones of inhibition were observed in disc diffusion antibacterial screening against four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and six Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi). The MIC values against these bacteria ranged from 8 to 64 mug/ml. In antifungal screening, the compound showed small zones of inhibition against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus aryzae. Candida albicans was resistant against the compound. In the cytotoxicity determination, LC(50) of the compound against brine shrimp nauplii was 13.25 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the compound has good antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria, moderate cytotoxicity against brine shrimp nauplii and insignificant antifungal activity against the tested fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plants used in traditional medicines of Ghana with particular reference to MRSA.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: : In an ethno botanical survey carried out in the Akwapim-North district of the Republic of Ghana, 25 plant species, used in traditional medicine to treat skin disease and/or to treat antimicrobial (viral, bacterial or protozoan) infections were identified. AIM OF STUDY: : To investigate the antimicrobial activity of traditional Ghanaian medicines with special interest in anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Chloroform, ethanol and aqueous extracts (including use of a Stomacher) of these plants were prepared and agar-well diffusion tests, MIC's and MBC's were used to investigate antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Extracts of 13 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following bacteria: MRSA, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris. Extracts from 11 of these 13 plant species also inhibited the growth of three or more of 14 additional clinical isolates of MRSA. Aqueous extracts of Alchornea cordifolia were active against all 21 bacterial strains tested and showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity overall with MIC's against MRSA in the range of 1.6-3.1 mgml(-1) and MBC's in the range of 6.3-12.5 mgml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: : The presence of antibacterial activity in extracts of Elaeophorbia drupifera, Rauwolfia vomitoria and the leaves of Solanum verbascifolium, plants traditionally used to treat skin infections, are reported for the first time. Extracts from Alchornea cordifolia, also used to treat wounds, had the widest spectrum of antibacterial activity.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of peptides derived from human beta-2 glycoprotein I is inhibited by protein H and M1 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - During the last years, the importance of antibacterial peptides has attracted considerable attention. We report here that peptides derived from the fifth domain of beta-2 glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI), a human heparin binding plasma protein, have antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen that can survive and grow in human blood, has developed mechanisms to escape the attack by these peptides. Thus, protein H and M1 protein, two surface proteins of the highly pathogenic S. pyogenes AP1 strain, bind full-length beta(2)GPI and thereby prevent the processing of beta(2)GPI by proteases from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into antibacterial peptides. In addition, protein H and M1 protein, released from the bacterial cell wall by PMN-derived proteases, bind to, and inhibit the activity of, beta(2)GPI-derived antibacterial peptides. Taken together, the data suggest that the interaction between the streptococcal proteins and beta(2)GPI or beta(2)GPI-derived peptides presents a novel mechanism to resist an antibacterial attack by beta(2)GPI-cleavage products.
TI  - Evaluating the role of HLA-DQ polymorphisms on immune response to bacterial superantigens using transgenic mice.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens bind directly to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and vigorously activate T cells expressing certain T-cell receptor variable region families. As interaction with HLA class II molecules is the primary step in this process, polymorphic variations in HLA class II can determine the extent of superantigen binding to HLA class II molecules, govern the magnitude of immune activation induced by given superantigens and determine the outcome of superantigen-mediated diseases. As direct assessment of the influence of HLA class II polymorphism in humans is impossible because of expression of more than one HLA class II alleles in a given individual and toxicity of superantigens, transgenic mice expressing HLA-DQ6 (HLA-DQA1*0103 and HLA-DQB1*0601) and HLA-DQ8 (HLA-DQA1*0301 and HLA-DQB1*0302) were used to achieve this goal. HLA-DQ6 and HLA-DQ8 elicited comparable in vitro and in vivo immune response to staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) A, SEB, SEH and SEK, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE) A and SPEC and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ). However, each superantigen had a unique T-cell receptor activation profile. In vivo challenge with Streptococcus pyogenes, H305, capable of elaborating SPEA and SMEZ, yielded a similar clinical outcome in HLA-DQ6 and HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice. In conclusion, HLA-DQ6 and HLA-DQ8 elicited comparable response to certain bacterial superantigens. Our report highlights the advantages of HLA class II transgenic mice in such studies.
TI  - A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB) assay for detection of bacterial respiratory pathogens in children with pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a novel method for simultaneous identification of 12 potential bacterial pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed, to identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) PCRs were used for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae only. In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. RESULTS: Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens--by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae but each was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special culture methods.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - A 39-year-old man with a skin infection.
AB  - The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.
TI  - Dental implants with locking taper connection versus screwed connection: microbiologic and scanning electron microscope study.
AB  - The aim of this study is to carry out an analysis of the Fixture-Abutment Interfaces (FAI), comparing different connection systems, to evaluate the role of geometric discrepancy, which is present between the abutment and the fixture, in favoring the permeability to bacterial colonization. Two types of commercially available FAI were studied, 16 screwed FAI (Sweden-Martina Italia) (4 of O 3.8 mm diameter, 4 of O 4.7 mm diameter, 4 of O 5.7 mm diameter and 4 of O 6.7 mm diameter) and 4 FAI (Bicon) (O 3.5mm diameter). The assays were carried out in vitro, placing the different dental implants in contact with broth culture of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyogenes to test the infiltration inside the FAI. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was carried out to evaluate the gap at the fixture-abutment interface. In all the locking taper FAI and in the screwed FAI with a diameter of 3.8 mm there was no trace of bacterial infiltration of the species examined. In the screwed FAI with a diameter of 4.7 mm, 5.7 mm and 6.7 mm there was an increasing level of bacterial infiltration in relationship to the diameter. Therefore, this paper shows that there exists an important correlation between the diameter of the screwed implant and the permeability to microbic infiltration that is directly proportional to the diameter of the implant.
TI  - Spontaneous infective spondylitis and mycotic aneurysm: incidence, risk factors,  outcome and management experience.
AB  - Infective spondylitis occurring concomitantly with mycotic aneurysm is rare. A retrospective record review was conducted in all cases of mycotic aneurysm from January 1995 to December 2004, occurring in a primary care and tertiary referral center. Spontaneous infective spondylitis and mycotic aneurysm were found in six cases (10.3% of 58 mycotic aneurysm patients). Neurological deficit (50% vs. 0; P < 0.001) is the significant clinical manifestation in patients with spontaneous infective spondylitis and mycotic aneurysm. The presence of psoas abscess on computed tomography (83.3% vs. 0; P < 0.001) and endplate destruction on radiography (50% vs. 0; P < 0.001) are predominated in patients with spontaneous infective spondylitis and mycotic aneurysm. Of these six patients, four with Salmonella infection received surgical intervention and all survived. Another two patients (one with Streptococcus pyogenes, another with Staphylococcus aureus) received conservative therapy and subsequently died from rupture of aneurysm or septic shock. Paravertebral soft tissue swelling, presence of psoas abscess and/or unclear soft tissue plane between the aorta and vertebral body in relation to mycotic aneurysm may indicate a concomitant infection in the spine. In contrast, if prevertebral mass is found in the survey of spine infection, coexisting mycotic aneurysm should be considered.
TI  - Retapamulin: a semisynthetic pleuromutilin compound for topical treatment of skin infections in adults and children.
AB  - Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin compound with in vitroactivity against Gram-positive bacteria, no cross-resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents in current use and a low potential for development of resistance. A 1% ointment formulation has been developed for clinical use, and a placebo-controlled trial of impetigo in 210 patients produced significantly higher rates of clinical and microbiological success compared with placebo - 85.6 versus 52.1% and 91.2 versus 50.9%, respectively. Additional comparative studies in over 1900 patients showed noninferiority to topical fusidic acid and oral cephalexin and a low frequency of adverse events. In 2007, retapamulin was approved in the USA for topical treatment of impetigo caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and in the EU for topical treatment of impetigo and infected wounds caused by S. pyogenes and S. aureus, with approvals including adults and children over 9 months of age.
TI  - Hyperimmune products in the prevention and therapy of infectious disease: a report of a hyperimmune products expert advisory panel.
AB  - This paper reviews a meeting at which basic pathophysiology of infections, mechanisms of action of hyperimmune products and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, as well as currently available hyperimmunes and their potential new targets and uses, were discussed. A hyperimmune product was defined as either a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal preparation enriched with antibody directed against one or more particular targets. A number of issues were emphasised, including: resistant bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes; the role of hyperimmune intravenous globulins in the prevention of sepsis in low birthweight infants; hepatitis B virus infection associated with liver transplantation; combination therapy; the potential role of hyperimmunes in the prevention and treatment of hepatitis C virus; and the use of immunoglobulins for the prophylaxis of Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disease. Routes of administration were also discussed. It was concluded that the development of hyperimmunes faces numerous obstacles. It was agreed that the use of hyperimmunes in clinical trials must be standardised; clinical trials must be large enough to have sufficient power to demonstrate efficacy with clear-cut end-points, and means need to be developed, in conjunction with regulatory agencies, for the feasible evaluation of combination products. However, progress in all these aspects will provide a wide range of hyperimmunes for future use.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Triggering psoriasis: the role of infections and medications.
AB  - Psoriasis can be provoked or exacerbated by a variety of different environmental  factors, particularly infections and drugs. Strong evidence exists for the induction of guttate psoriasis by a preceding tonsillar Streptococcus pyogenes infection, whereas disease exacerbation has been linked with skin and/or gut colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Malassezia, and Candida albicans. The role, if any, of viruses (papillomaviruses, HIV, and endogenous retroviruses) present in lesional skin is at present unknown. The use of various drugs, such as lithium, beta-blockers, antimalarial agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has also been associated with induction or worsening of disease in psoriatic patients.
TI  - Alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin inhibit production of Staphylococcus aureus exotoxins.
AB  - Prior studies suggest Staphylococcus aureus exotoxins are not produced when the organism is cultured in human blood. Human blood was fractionated into plasma and water-lysed red blood cells, and it was demonstrated that mixtures of alpha and beta globins of hemoglobin (as low as 1 mug/mL) inhibited S. aureus exotoxin production while increasing production of protein A and not affecting bacterial growth. Pepsin but not trypsin digestion destroyed the ability of alpha and beta globin to inhibit exotoxin production. Exotoxin production by both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible organisms was inhibited. Production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A by Streptococcus pyogenes was unaffected by alpha and beta globin chains but was inhibited when produced in S. aureus. Use of isogenic S. aureus strains suggested the targets of alpha and beta globin chains, leading to inhibition of staphylococcal exotoxins, included the two-component system SrrA-SrrB. delta hemolysin production was also inhibited, suggesting the two-component (and quorum sensing) system AgrA-AgrC was targeted. The alpha and beta globin chains represent promising molecules to interfere with the pathogenesis of serious staphylococcal diseases.
TI  - Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center. (2) To determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment. DESIGN: A descriptive case-control study. SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center. METHODS: Medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1-16 yrs) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001-December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included the following: demographics; clinical presentation; laboratory and microbiology results; management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotic(s); treatment failures; and time spent in the ED. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105). Treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). The cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. More time in the ED (521 +/- 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 +/- 2.8) were seen in the intravenous group as compared with the oral group (time in ED, 164 +/- 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 +/- 1). CONCLUSIONS: Noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis is most commonly treated using first-generation cephalosporins. Treatment with oral antibiotics was effective and required fewer visits and less time in the ED compared with intravenous treatment. Twice-daily cefazolin and probenecid was associated with less treatment failures and admissions than cefazolin alone and may represent a reasonable alternative for children with nonfacial cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics.
TI  - Pediatric mastoiditis in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era: symptom duration guides empiric antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. We hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. OBJECTIVES: To compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the pre-PCV (January 1995-December 2000) and post-PCV (January 2001- April 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of mastoiditis from January 1995 to April 2005. RESULTS: : One hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-PCV and 54 post-PCV. Etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. The most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). There was no reduction in mastoiditis due to S. pneumoniae from the pre-PCV to the post-PCV eras (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-2.1; P = 0.77). Ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-PCV S. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-PCV isolates. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.2-52.2; P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (OR, 16.4; 95% CI, 2.1-75.8; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by S. pneumoniae in the pre-PCV versus post-PCV eras. Empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-PCV era.
TI  - Commercial peptidoglycan preparations are contaminated with superantigen-like activity that stimulates IL-17 production.
AB  - The immunomodulatory properties of peptidoglycan (PGN), a constituent of the bacterial cell wall, have been studied extensively but with contrasting results. Recent studies have demonstrated that the TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses elicited by Gram-positive PGN preparations are in fact a result of contaminating lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid that can be removed only through sophisticated extraction procedures. Here, we report that commercial preparations of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes PGN are contaminated with bacterial superantigens (SAg). The T cell-derived cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F were induced by PGN preparations but not by TLR agonists or nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor agonists in human PBMC. IL-17 induction by PGN preparations was sensitive to protease digestion and required TCR signaling. Bacterial SAg could be detected by immunoblot in the PGN preparations, and purified recombinant SAg were powerful inducers of IL-17. Finally, the PGN preparations stimulated proliferation and expansion of T cells bearing specific TCR V beta elements. Our results suggest that a large body of literature that relied on commercial PGN preparations to study inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, where IL-17 also plays an important role, should be interpreted with caution and possibly revisited. Future studies aimed at characterizing the activities of PGN should use PGN preparations of proven purity.
TI  - Cospray dried antibiotics for dry powder lung delivery.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination antibiotic therapy, containing doxycycline and ciprofloxacin (both hydrochloride) as a dry powder (DPI) formulation for inhalation. Single and combination antibiotics were produced by spray drying. Particle size distributions were characterized by laser diffraction and imaging conducted by scanning electron microscopy. Solid-state characterisation of the antibiotics was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, X-ray powder diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. Using the Aerolizer device, the aerosol performance was measured using multistage liquid impinger and analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (R(2) = 1.0, CV = 0.4-1.0%). Furthermore, a disk diffusion test was performed for the assessment of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the raw and spray dried antibiotics against bacteria. Results showed that cospray drying of the ciprofloxacin and doxycycline produced an antibiotic formulation (in a 1:1 ratio) suitable for inhalation that showed to be physically more stable then the analogous single spray dried antibiotic. The cospray dried powder has improved dispersion over the less stable single spray dried ciprofloxacin. The spray dried antibiotics were observed to have similar antimicrobial activity to the original antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyrogenes, suggesting the spray drying process does not affect the anti-bacterial activity of the drug. Cospray dried antibiotics from a DPI is thus feasible and can potentially be an attractive delivery alternative to the more conventional systemic delivery route.
TI  - Antibacterial oxazolidinones possessing a novel C-5 side chain. (5R)-trans-3-[3-Fluoro-4- (1-oxotetrahydrothiopyran-4-yl)phenyl]-2- oxooxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid amide (PF-00422602), a new lead compound.
AB  - Oxazolidinones possessing a C-5 carboxamide functionality (reverse amides) represent a new series of compounds that block bacterial protein synthesis. These reverse amides also exhibited less potency against monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes and thus possess less potential for the side effects associated with MAO inhibition. The title compound (14) showed reduced in vivo myelotoxicity compared to linezolid in a 14-day safety study in rats, potent in vivo efficacy in murine systemic infection models, and excellent pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of potent heterocyclic oxazolidinones and the identification of RBx 8700.
AB  - Several potent oxazolidinone antibacterial agents were obtained by systematic modification of the linker between the five-membered heterocycle and the piperazinyl ring of RBx 7644 (Ranbezolid, 1) and its thienyl analogue 2, leading to the identification of an expanded spectrum compound RBx 8700 (6b).
TI  - [Epidemiology and bacteriological diagnosis of paediatric acute osteoarticular infections].
AB  - Acute paediatric osteo-articular infections require a fast and sensitive diagnosis allowing a treatment directed to the causative pathogen. Many micro-organisms can be incriminated, but Staphylococcus aureus and Kingella kingae markedly prevail. K. kingae became the first bacterial species responsible for septic arthritis in children < 3 years. More rarely, (2)haemolytic Streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae are found. The incidence of community acquired S. aureus resistant to oxacillin in osteo-articular infections is still low in France. The microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis relies upon analysis of articular fluid, which requires systematic inoculation of a blood culture vial to increase the recovery rate of K. kingae. If the culture is negative, it is recommended to carry out a universal PCR or a PCR targeted to the main germs responsible for septic arthritis. Indeed, PCR represents an undeniable benefice for the diagnosis of paediatric septic arthritis, particularly for the DNA detection of K. kingae. The diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis relies primarily upon blood cultures, since the bone puncture is not a systematic procedure in this setting. Their efficiency is low, and there is still a need to look for other arguments of diagnosis such as search of possible portals of entry or specific serologies.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (Actichelated propolis).
AB  - AIMS: This study compared in vitro activities of Actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater potency of Actichelated propolis (MIC range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (MIC range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). Concentrations of Actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. Preincubation of Strep. pyogenes and H. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of Actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x MIC) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Effects of AV119, a natural sugar from avocado, on Malassezia furfur invasiveness and on the expression of HBD-2 and cytokines in human keratinocytes.
AB  - AV119 is a patented blend of two sugars from avocado that can induce human beta-defensin-2 production by normal human keratinocytes. In this study, we analysed the effect of AV119 on growth and invasiveness of Malassezia furfur, a dimorphic, lipid-dependent yeast that is part of the normal human cutaneous commensal flora. The ability to modulate the expression of the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines in normal human keratinocytes was also investigated. Microbiological assay demonstrated that this sugar induced the aggregation of yeast cells and inhibited the invasiveness of M. furfur, without affecting its growth. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that AV119 was able to modulate the HBD-2 response in treated keratinocytes, reaching a maximum after 48-h treatment, and to induce the recovery of a satisfactory proinflammatory response in human keratinocytes. As AV119 can induce aggregation of yeast cells, thus inhibiting their penetration into the keratinocytes, the sugar could be used in the preparation of cosmetics or pharmacological drugs to inhibit colonization of the skin by pathogenic strains of M. furfur.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Topical retapamulin ointment, 1%, versus sodium fusidate ointment, 2%, for impetigo: a randomized, observer-blinded, noninferiority study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retapamulin is a novel pleuromutilin antibacterial developed for topical use. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of retapamulin ointment, 1% (twice daily for 5 days), with sodium fusidate ointment, 2% (3 times daily for 7 days), in impetigo. METHODS: A randomized (2:1 retapamulin to sodium fusidate), observer-blinded, noninferiority, phase III study in 519 adult and pediatric (aged > or = 9 months) subjects. RESULTS: Retapamulin and sodium fusidate had comparable clinical efficacies (per-protocol population: 99.1 and 94.0%, respectively; difference: 5.1%, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-9.0%, p = 0.003; intent-to-treat population: 94.8 and 90.1%, respectively; difference: 4.7%, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 9.7%, p = 0.062). Bacteriological efficacies were similar. Success rates in the small numbers of sodium-fusidate-, methicillin- and mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were good for retapamulin (9/9, 8/8 and 6/6, respectively). Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Retapamulin is a highly effective and convenient new treatment option for impetigo, with efficacy against isolates resistant to existing therapies.
TI  - Bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. The purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. In recurrent tonsillitis, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). In patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated at a significantly higher percentage. In tonsillar hypertrophy, H. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by S. pyogenes (24.2%), S. aureus (22.9%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). Furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. In both groups, S. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas K. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. We found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, H. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. We also found no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. CONCLUSIONS: We observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. Our study indicates that essential bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.
TI  - A silkworm model of pathogenic bacterial infection.
AB  - Silkworms are invertebrate animals that are killed by bacteria pathogenic against humans, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae. Injection into the hemolymph of antibiotics that are clinically used for human patients abolishes the killing effects. There are several advantages to using silkworms as an infection model, such as low cost, the absence of ethical problems that are associated with the use of mammals, and a body size large enough to handle while injecting sample solution into the hemolymph. We screened S. aureus mutants with attenuated virulence against silkworms and found three novel virulence regulatory genes, cvfA, cvfB, and cvfC. These genes contribute to virulence against mice and are required for exotoxin production. The cvfA gene is required for expression of the agr locus, which regulates most exotoxin genes, and a novel DNA binding protein SarZ. Silkworms are susceptible to S. aureus beta toxin, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A, and diphtheria toxin. Therefore, silkworms are a promising infection model animal for the identification and evaluation of virulenceassociated genes.
TI  - Enolases from Gram-positive bacterial pathogens and commensal lactobacilli share  functional similarity in virulence-associated traits.
AB  - Enolase occurs as a cytoplasmic and a surface-associated protein in bacteria. Enolases of the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as of the commensal lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were purified as His(6)-fusion proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were compared for putative virulence-associated functions, i.e., binding of human plasminogen, enhancement of plasminogen activation by human plasminogen activators, as well as binding to immobilized laminin, fibronectin and collagens. The individual enolases showed varying efficiencies in these functions. In particular, highly and equally effective interactions with plasminogen and laminin were seen with lactobacillar and staphylococcal enolases.
TI  - Direct economic effect following mupirocin therapy failure among patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in a large population-based cohort.
AB  - The goal of the study was to derive initial costs associated with failure of initial mupirocin therapy among patients diagnosed with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (uSSSIs). A retrospective observational analysis of medical, pharmacy, and enrollment records was conducted using data from the National Managed Care Benchmark Database. Patients were classified as failing treatment with mupirocin if they either filled a second antibiotic commonly used to treat uSSSIs five to 30 days after their index mupirocin prescription fill or experienced a uSSSI-related hospitalization within 30 days after the index mupirocin prescription fill. Among 12,650 failure episodes, 11,867 (93.8%) required a second antibiotic contributing a mean cost of $62 per prescription. Approximately 4,782 (37.8%) had an associated outpatient encounter resulting in a mean cost of $221 per encounter. Nine percent of failures required a hospitalization with a mean cost of $6,597 per hospitalization. These medical, hospital, and pharmacy costs translated into an expected cost of $735.45 per mupirocin failure among patients with uSSSIs. The management of uSSSIs is costly in terms of health care resource use and direct health care expenditures when initial therapy with mupirocin fails.
TI  - Antimicrobial compounds from the Australian desert plant Eremophila neglecta.
AB  - A crude extract from the Australian desert plant Eremophila neglecta has recently been shown to possess antibacterial activity in a survey of candidate plants that may bear novel antimicrobial compounds. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the Et(2)O extract of E. neglecta using a broth microdilution assay led to the isolation of three new serrulatane-type diterpenoids, 2,19-diacetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-ene (2), 8,19-dihydroxyserrulat-14-ene (3), and 8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (4), and a known o-naphthoquinone commonly referred to as biflorin (5). The structures of 2-5 were determined using 1D and 2D NMR, FTIR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Compounds 3-5 showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 6.5 to 101.6 microM and 12.7 to 202.9 microM, respectively. No activity was observed for these compounds against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Altabax (retapamulin ointment), 1%.

TI  - Crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2X: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. To envision the binding of cefditoren to PBPs, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of PBP 2X from S. pneumoniae strain R6 complexed with cefditoren. There are two PBP 2X molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the orientation of Trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. The methylthiazole group of the C-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues His394, Trp374, and Thr526 in molecule 1 and residues His394, Asp375, and Thr526 in molecule 2. The formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the pocket to which the C-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. These features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against S. pneumoniae.
TI  - QSAR studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. Components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. FabH, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of FabH and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which demonstrate FabH inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. The QSAR studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus). On the other side presence of hetero-atoms like N, O, or S at R(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. The comparison of QSAR between the FabH inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, N. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.
TI  - Polyarticular septic arthritis following septic circumcision.
AB  - Ritual circumcision during an initiation ceremony for young adults is common practice in parts of South Africa. We report on a case of polyarticular septic arthritis in a seventeen-year-old man following septicaemia after circumcision, resulting in severe fixed flexion deformities of both knees. This case illustrates an unusual cause of polyarticular septic arthritis and the treatment difficulties associated with delayed presentation. It is also a reminder of the consequences of untreated acute septic arthritis.
TI  - Exaggerated insect bite reaction exacerbated by a pyogenic infection in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
AB  - A 69-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presented with an 18-month history of pruritic, tender, erythematous plaques. The recurrent lesions simulated insect bites and cellulitis, but failed to respond to appropriate treatments. A recent severe flare was associated with markedly elevated inflammatory markers and swelling of the left leg. The swelling settled rapidly with ibuprofen, leaving cellulitis around a small ulcer infected with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The cellulitis responded to oral flucloxacillin. Subsequent multiple small exaggerated insect bite reaction lesions settled with oral prednisolone. Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells' syndrome) was considered unlikely based on the lack of a morphoea-like resolution phase, histological lack of flame figures and presence of vasculitis; however, the distinction is probably artificial.
TI  - Synthesis, partition coefficients and antibacterial activity of 3'-phenyl (substituted)-6'-aryl-2' (1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3-H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones].
AB  - Condensation of isatin with primary aryl amines gave a series of Schiff bases (1) which on reaction with thioglycolic acid in 1,4-dioxane afforded the formation of the corresponding 4- thiazolidinones (2). Compound 2 on condensation with substituted benzaldehydes in anhydrous sodium acetate furnished 3-aryl -5'-phenyl (substituted) spiro [3H-indole-3,2'-thiazolidines]-2-(1H), 4'(5'H)-diones (3). The latter (3) on reaction with hydrazine hydrochloride in anhydrous sodium acetate gave 3'-phenyl (substituted) -6'-aryl-2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-ones] (4). The structure has been established on the basis of spectral data. The partition coefficient for n-octanol/water solvent system and in vitro antibacterial activity of the 2'(1H)-cis-3',3'a-dihydrospiro [3H-indole-3,5'-pyrazolo (3',4'-d)-thiazolo-2-(1H)-one] derivatives have been evaluated.
TI  - Triphala promotes healing of infected full-thickness dermal wound.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is a major problem in the management of wounds. Even though the development of synthetic antimicrobial agents persists, drug resistance and toxicity hinder their way. Many plants with multi-potent pharmaceutical activities may offer better treatment options, and Triphala (dried fruits of Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellirica, and Phyllanthus emblica) are potential formulations evaluated for healing activity on infected wound as it possesses numerous activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alcoholic extract of Triphala has shown in vitro antimicrobial activity against wound pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. An ointment was prepared from the Triphala extract (10% w/w) and assessed for in vivo wound healing on infected rat model by rate of healing, bacterial count, biochemical analysis, and expression of matrix metalloproteinases. RESULTS: The treated group has shown significantly improved wound closure. Assessment of granulation tissue on every fourth day showed significant reduction in bacterial count with significant level of collagen, hexosamine, uronic acid, and superoxide dismutase in the treated group (P < 0.01). Reduction of matrix metalloproteinase expression observed in the treated group by gelatin zymography and immunoblotting confirms our in vivo assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The above results showed the antibacterial, wound healing, and antioxidant activities of Triphala ointment, necessary for the management of infected wounds. Active principles of the Triphala may be further evaluated and used as an excellent therapeutic formulation for infected wounds.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 7-fluoro-3-aminosteroids.
AB  - A series of 7-fluoro-3-aminosteroids were synthesized and their in vitro antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The nucleophilic fluorination of several 7beta-hydroxysteroids by diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in n-pentane, followed by reductive amination of the resulting 7-fluoro-3-ketosteroids with spermidine in the presence of NaBH(3)CN, afforded 7-fluoro-3-aminosteroids in high yield. Compound 25 showed the highest antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy for skin infections.
AB  - The most common skin infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes), or the normal skin flora. An antistaphylococcal oral antibiotic is the preferred treatment for nonbullous and bullous impetigo, and a therapeutic agent that is effective against both S aureus and streptococci is appropriate for most cases of cellulitis. For furuncles, carbuncles, cutaneous abscesses, and inflamed epidermal cysts, the most important therapy is incision and drainage, and in most cases there is no need for antimicrobial therapy. Patients with venous ulcers and atopic eczema do not benefit from systemic antimicrobial therapy unless obvious infection is present, as indicated by clinical features such as fever, cellulitis, and lymphangitis.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial compounds from Eremophila serrulata.
AB  - We report a search for antimicrobial compounds in the Australian plant Eremophila serrulata. Bioassay directed fractionation of a diethyl ether extract prepared from the leaves of E. serrulata led to the isolation of two compounds, an omicron-naphthoquinone, 9-methyl-3-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran-7,8-dione (2), and a serrulatane diterpenoid, 20-acetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (3). Two other known serrulatane-type diterpenoids, 8,20-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (4) and 8,20-diacetoxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (5) were also isolated. None of these compounds had previously been tested for antimicrobial activity. Compounds 2-5 showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 15.6 to 250mug/mL. Compound 2 was the most active with an MIC of 15.6mug/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 125mug/mL. This compound also showed antimicrobial activity against other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No activity was observed for this compound against all Gram-negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Evaluation of an internally controlled real-time polymerase chain reaction assay  targeting the groEL gene for the detection of Bartonella spp. DNA in patients with suspected cat-scratch disease.
AB  - Bartonella (B.) henselae is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (CSD), which usually presents as a self-limiting lymphadenopathy. This study reports the development and evaluation of an internally controlled real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the groEL gene for detection of Bartonella spp. DNA was extracted using the MagNA Pure system. The lower detection limit was 10-100 fg DNA and the in vitro sensitivity of the assay was not affected by duplexing with an internal control PCR. The real-time PCR assay detected DNA from all five B. henselae strains tested, and from B. birtlesii, B. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii, B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis and B. doshiae. The assay generated negative results with a selection of other bacteria, including several Mycobacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Results of real-time PCR in clinical samples were compared with those of a conventional 16S rDNA-based PCR assay. During the period described in the Material and methods section, real-time PCR and conventional 16S PCR were performed on 73 clinical samples. Of these samples, 29 (40%) were found to give positive results and 44 (60%) gave negative results, both by real-time PCR and by conventional PCR, with a 100% agreement between the two tests. The PCR developed in this study is a rapid, sensitive, and simple method for the detection of Bartonella spp. in CSD and is suitable for implementation in the diagnostic laboratory.
TI  - Therapeutic applications of tigecycline in the management of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Complicated skin and skin structure infections encompass a diverse range of diseases frequently caused by Gram-positive pathogens, and most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Treatment of these infections represents a growing clinical challenge as increases in multi-drug-resistant organisms and cross-resistance to antimicrobial therapy have made empiric therapeutic choices more difficult, particularly for patients with known risk factors or who are immunocompromised. Complicating this issue has been the relative lack of new agents with antimicrobial potency against prevalent resistant species such as meticillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with potent microbiological activity against the wide variety of organisms implicated in the aetiology of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Recent phase III clinical data confirm previous observations on the safety and efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Tigecycline was shown to be non-inferior to combination vancomycin-aztreonam regimens and exhibited high clinical success rates. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were uniformly low for both susceptible and resistant pathogens. Adverse events were similar in incidence for both patient populations, with nausea and vomiting reported more frequently with tigecycline treated patients while rash and elevated liver transaminases were most commonly observed in the vancomycin-aztreonam treatment group. Tigecycline helps to address the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to combat the emergence of multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Current clinical, microbiological and safety data support the use of tigecycline as a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates recently  obtained in Europe.
AB  - The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
TI  - Understanding how leading bacterial pathogens subvert innate immunity to reveal novel therapeutic targets.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and group A Streptococcus (GAS) are prominent Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, each associated with a variety of mucosal and invasive human infections. SA and GAS systemic disease reflects diverse abilities of these pathogens to resist clearance by the multifaceted defenses of the human innate immune system. Here we review how SA and GAS avoid the bactericidal activities of cationic antimicrobial peptides, delay phagocyte recruitment, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, inhibit complement and antibody opsonization functions, impair phagocytotic uptake, resist oxidative burst killing, and promote phagocyte lysis or apoptosis. Understanding the molecular basis of SA and GAS innate immune resistance reveals novel therapeutic targets for treatment or prevention of invasive human infections. These future therapies envision alternatives to direct microbial killing, such as blocking disease progression by neutralizing specific virulence factors or boosting key innate immune defenses.
TI  - Synthesis and structure of silver complexes with nicotinate-type ligands having antibacterial activities against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synthesis and low-temperature X-ray crystal structures of five new silver complexes, [Ag(2)-mu-O,O'(2-aminonicotinium)(2)(NO(3))(2)](n) (7), [Ag(isonicotinamide)(2)-mu-O,O'(NO(3))](2) (8), [Ag(ethyl nicotinate)(2)](NO(3)) (9), [Ag(ethyl isonicotinate)(2)(NO(3))] (10), and [Ag(methyl isonicotinate)(2)(H(2)O)](NO(3)) (11), are presented and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial activities of these complexes were screened using 12 different clinical isolates belonging to four pathogenic bacteria, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, P. mirabilis, and Ps. Aeruginosa, all obtained from diabetic foot ulcers. These tested bacteria were resistant for at least 10 antibiotics commonly used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Compounds 7 and 8 had considerable activity against Ps. Aeruginosa (MIC values 2-8 microg/mL), compound 9 against S. aureus (MIC 4-16 microg/mL) and S. pyogenes (MIC 2-4 microg/mL), and also 9 and 11 against P. mirabilis (MIC 1-16 microg/mL). All complexes were non-toxic for daphnia at concentrations above 512 microg/mL overnight.
TI  - [Infectious diseases in problem drug users hospitalized in the infectious ward of the Motol University Hospital in 2002-2005].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To survey infectious diseases in intravenous drug users and to provide basic information on disease course in this subpopulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all inpatient intravenous drug users, from 2002 to 2005. The obtained data were sorted according to the main diagnosis and final results of chronic infections were achieved by outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 436 cases of intravenous drug users in our group, 44 % (191/436) were patients admitted with acute viral hepatitis, 16 % (67/436) with soft-tissue or skin infections, 7 % (29/436) with respiratory infections, 4 % (18/436) with urogenital infections and 4 % (19/436) with sepsis. Progression to chronic hepatitis B occurred in 3 % (4/125) of cases, fulminant course of acute hepatitis B was observed in 1.6 % (2/125) of cases. Spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus was demonstrated in 46 % (11/24) of subjects. The most frequent pathogens responsible for bacterial infections in drug users were Staphylococcus aureus (53 %, 27/51) and Streptococcus pyogenes (22 %, 11/51). In the infectious endocarditis group, right heart valves were affected in 78 % (7/9), left heart valves in 11 % (1/9) and bilateral lesions were seen in 11 % (1/9) of cases. Two (22 %, 2/9) endocarditis patients died (one with tricuspid and the other with aortic valve involvement). Patients with the main diagnosis other than hepatitis were screened and 71 % of them were found positive for anti-HCV, 57 % for anti-HBc total and 32 % for anti-HAV total. CONCLUSIONS: During the analyzed period, no HIV-positive drug users were found. The findings are in striking contrast to data published abroad. Treatment of drug users is often complicated by low compliance with the treatment and hospital regimens and/or by a frequent lack of follow-up treatment. Despite this fact, no significant variations in the course or results of infectious diseases in drug users were found in comparison to the general population.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome: experience in a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with TSS admitted to the intensive care unit in the previous 15 years. The patients included were those that met the clinical and microbiological criteria for TSS proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: There were nine patients (four boys). The mean age was 7 years. The most frequent findings were fever (100 %), hypotension (100 %), erythroderma (100 %), multisystem organ failure [coagulopathy (100 %), lethargy (89 %), hypertransaminasemia (89 %), increased creatine phosphokinase levels (78 %), renal failure (66 %)] and cutaneous desquamation (100 %). Laboratory studies showed changes in the leukocyte count and C-reactive protein value in all patients. The etiology was as follows: Staphylococcus was detected in six patients (S. epidermidis in three and S. aureus in three) and Streptococcus was detected in two patients (S. pyogenes in one and S. pneumoniae in one); no microorganisms were detected in only one patient. The origin of the infection was identified in seven patients (cutaneous in six patients and tonsillar in one). All patients received life support and antibiotic treatment. Six patients received corticosteroid treatment and one received intravenous immunoglobulins. Patients with TSS secondary to Streptococcus showed the greatest severity, exhibiting renal failure and requiring greater respiratory and circulatory support. All patients recovered well from the infection, without serious long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION. TSS should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever, exanthema and shock, since early diagnosis has been shown to improve outcomes. S. pneumoniae should be included among the microorganisms that cause TSS. Treatment is based on life support measures and antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Chitosan malate inhibits growth and exotoxin production of toxic shock syndrome-inducing Staphylococcus aureus strains and group A streptococci.
AB  - Previously, it has been shown that the polysaccharide chitosan inhibits the growth of gram-positive bacteria. In this study, chitosan malate was evaluated in broth and thin-film cultures for its effect on the growth and exotoxin production of toxic shock syndrome (TSS)-inducing Staphylococcus aureus (five strains, three producing TSS toxin 1 and one each producing enterotoxin B or C) and group A streptococci (three strains producing streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A). Also, the compound was evaluated in a rabbit subcutaneous Wiffle ball model for its ability to prevent S. aureus and group A streptococcal induction of TSS. Finally, chitosan malate was evaluated for its ability to prevent TSS and necrotizing fasciitis in rabbits after subcutaneous inoculation with microbes. Chitosan malate inhibited both bacterial growth and, at sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations, the production of exotoxins, in both broth and thin-film cultures. Rabbits treated with chitosan malate in implanted Wiffle balls were protected from prior challenge with TSS-inducing S. aureus compared to animals not receiving chitosan malate (P < 0.001) and group A streptococci (P < 0.005). Chitosan malate protected rabbits from the development of streptococcal TSS with necrotizing fasciitis (P < 0.01). The data suggest that use of this growth- and toxin-inhibitory compound may be able to reduce the severity of S. aureus and group A streptococcal mucous membrane and trauma-associated skin infections.
TI  - [A tenacious lameness in a 2-year-old child].
AB  - Spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc Spondylodiscitis, a septic infection of the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebrae, is an unusual infection, mainly affecting children and elderly people. It is classically associated with tuberculosis, but other germs such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or mitis, and some even more unususal ones (e.g. Kingella kingae), are often encountered in our countries. Non tuberculous spondylodiscitis is found in approximately 2% of pediatric bone infections. Medullar compression and bone destruction can occur, especially when diagnosis is delayed, hence the value of early diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of a non tuberculous spondylodiscitis occurring in a 22 month-old baby
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. METHODS: Aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). The number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each). The predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), Peptostreptococcus spp (11), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
TI  - Synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. The systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. To overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. Many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. Among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleoside kinases activate nucleoside antibiotics in severely pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Common bacterial pathogens are becoming progressively more resistant to traditional antibiotics, representing a major public-health crisis. Therefore, there is a need for a variety of antibiotics with alternative modes of action. In our study, several nucleoside analogs were tested against pathogenic staphylococci and streptococci. We show that pyrimidine-based nucleoside analogs, like 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',2'-difluoro-2'deoxycytidine (gemcitabine), are specifically activated by the endogenous bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases, leading to cell death. Deoxyribonucleoside kinase-deficient Escherichia coli strains become highly susceptible to nucleoside analogs when they express recombinant kinases from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. We further demonstrate that recombinant S. aureus deoxyadenosine kinase efficiently phosphorylates the anticancer drug gemcitabine in vitro and is therefore the key enzyme in the activation pathway. When adult mice were infected intraperitoneally with a fatal dose of S. pyogenes strain AP1 and afterwards received gemcitabine, they failed to develop a systemic infection. Nucleoside analogs may therefore represent a promising alternative for combating pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: manifestations, microbiology and connection with black tar heroin.
AB  - A 10-year review of records of the King County Medical Examiner's Office found 87 deaths due to necrotizing fasciitis and related necrotizing soft tissue infections. In 64 of these cases there were sufficient details to provide an analysis of the manifestations, microbiology, and source of infection. One half (32) of the cases were due to injection of black tar heroin, the nearly exclusive form of heroin in the Northwest United States. Of those due to black tar injection, 24 were clostridial infections with various species represented, eight of which were Clostridium sordellii. Of the 32 cases not associated with drug injection, streptococcal species predominated, with Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in 14 cases. Only three of 32 cases not associated with injection drug use were clostridial infections. These differences were statistically significant. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 14 cases; two were methicillin-resistant strains. Overall, 28 of the 64 cases were polymicrobial infections, 15 due to black tar injection and 13 not associated with drug injection. This study supports the conclusion that necrotizing fasciitis due to black tar heroin injection is predominantly a clostridial disease, and in this way differs significantly from necrotizing fasciitis due to other causes.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - Thrombospondin-1 promotes cellular adherence of gram-positive pathogens via recognition of peptidoglycan.
AB  - Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular glycoprotein that has key roles in interactions between human cells and components of the extracellular matrix. Here we report a novel role for the lectin TSP1 in pathogen-host interactions. Binding assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrate that Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens including S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes interact specifically with human TSP1. We also show for the first time that host cell-bound TSP1 promotes adherence of gram-positive pathogens to human epithelial and endothelial cell lines. Pretreatment of bacteria with sodium periodate but not Pronase E substantially reduced TSP1-mediated bacterial adherence to host cells, suggesting that a glycoconjugate on the bacterial cell surface functions as the receptor for TSP1. Lipoteichoic acids did not affect TSP1-mediated adherence of S. pneumoniae to host cells. In contrast, attachment of S. pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens to host cells via TSP1 was blocked by soluble peptidoglycan, indicating recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by TSP1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that recognition of gram-positive pathogens by TSP1 promotes bacterial colonization of host tissue cells. In this scenario, peptidoglycan functions as adhesin and TSP1 acts as a molecular bridge linking gram-positive bacteria with receptors on the host cell.
TI  - Bullous impetigo: a rare presentation in fulminant streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Since the mid-1980s, an increase in incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococci has been noted among adults and children. The characteristic clinical and laboratory features of the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome include deep-seated infection associated with shock, skin manifestation, and multiorgan failure. However, bullous impetigo is invariably considered to be a staphylococcal disease. Staphylococcus aureus produces an epidermolytic toxin, assumed to be the cause of bullous formation in the skin. Here, we present a case of bullous impetigo in an infant with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. This is a rare presentation of bullous impetigo caused by group A streptococcus.
TI  - Finding conserved and non-conserved reactions using a metabolic pathway alignment algorithm.
AB  - Using a metabolic pathway alignment method we developed, we studied highly conserved reactions in different groups of organisms and found out that biological functions vital for each of the groups are effectively expressed in the set of conserved reactions. We also studied the metabolic alignment of different strains of three bacteria and found out several non-conserved reactions. We suggest that these reactions could be either misannotations or reactions with a relevant but yet to be specified biological role, and should therefore be further investigated.
TI  - The role of superantigens of group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in Kawasaki disease.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Since the first suggestion of a superantigen hypothesis for Kawasaki disease over a decade ago, debate on the aetiology remains inconclusive. This article reviews recent publications that address the role of superantigens of group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past few years, new superantigens produced by group A Streptococcus and S. aureus have been increasingly identified, bringing the total known number to more than 30. Several studies on T-cell Vbeta repertoires and seroloepidemiology have demonstrated evidence for the involvement of single or multiple superantigens produced by the two pathogens. The associated superantigens differed in those studies, including streptococcal pyrogenic toxins A and C, staphylococcal enterotoxins A-C, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1. These disparate findings suggest that the inflammation of Kawasaki disease does not result from a single agent but rather a final common inflammatory pathway in genetically susceptible individuals after numerous infectious agents. SUMMARY: Certain staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens are suggested to be responsible for the development of Kawasaki disease. A better understanding of the precise role of the causative agents will lead to accurate diagnosis, more targeted therapy and an improvement of coronary outcomes.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects of macrolides antibiotics against clinical isolates, and examination of shape alteration by scanning electron microscope].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (MLs), erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. Bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 20 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide resistance genes, ermB and mefE, in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible MSSA of EM and CAM, were more potent than those of RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than EM, CAM and AZM. Against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. Twelve, 1 and 2 strains of MSSA, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to EM, CAM and AZM, whereas RKM was active to almost, but not quite, of them. Among 120 strains of S. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to EM (MIC; > or = 0.5 microg/mL), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (MIC; > 128 microg/mL) to EM, CAM and AZM, respectively. By contrast, for RKM, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. PCR analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of S. pyogenes and 2 of S. agalactiae carried mefE and ermB, respectively. In the case of S. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermB, mefE and both ermB and mefe. We also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of MLs using macrolide-susceptible, and ermB- and mefE-carrying S. pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. It was demonstrated that RKM had superior bactericidal activities and PAE than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. The numbers of test strains were 550 for Gram-positive aerobes, 700 for Gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. Cefcapene (CFPN), cefditoren (CDTR), and cefteram (CFTM) showed the most potent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (MFLX) and tosufloxacin among the new quinolones. Although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, 70% or more of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. Cephems showed good activities against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria except for Proteus spp. Specifically, CFPN, CDTR, and CFTM showed the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. The new quinolones showed potent activities against Gram-negative bacteria, especially H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not against Proteus mirabilis and Providencia spp. When compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired pediatric neck abscesses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the microbiology, particularly the prevalence of MRSA, in pediatric patients with community-acquired bacterial lymphadenitis. Long considered a nosocomial organism, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently emerged as a cause of community-acquired infections. Resistance to other classes of antibiotics, including clindamycin, is prevalent amongst S. aureus, as well. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records and culture results of patients under the age of 18 who underwent trans-cervical surgical drainage of abscessed lymph nodes between the years 2000 and 2006. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were identified for whom microbiology data were available. Six infections were classified as parapharyngeal on imaging; the remainder involved cervical chain lymph nodes. Forty-nine patients grew microorganisms on culture while 13 collections had no growth. The most common organism was S. aureus (63% of positive cultures); followed by beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus (22%). Of S. aureus isolates, 27% were oxacillin-resistant (MRSA). All MRSA isolates were sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and 25% sensitive to erythromycin. Of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates, 100, 86, and 82% were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. All MRSA isolates were identified during the latter half of the study period (2003-2006); none grew prior to 2003. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA is a common pathogen in community-acquired lymphadenitis, and its incidence is rising. Resistance to clindamycin, a drug commonly used to treat MRSA, is prevalent amongst methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. This has important implications regarding the empiric treatment of lymphadenitis in children.
TI  - Targeted drug-carrying bacteriophages as antibacterial nanomedicines.
AB  - While the resistance of bacteria to traditional antibiotics is a major public health concern, the use of extremely potent antibacterial agents is limited by their lack of selectivity. As in cancer therapy, antibacterial targeted therapy could provide an opportunity to reintroduce toxic substances to the antibacterial arsenal. A desirable targeted antibacterial agent should combine binding specificity, a large drug payload per binding event, and a programmed drug release mechanism. Recently, we presented a novel application of filamentous bacteriophages as targeted drug carriers that could partially inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This partial success was due to limitations of drug-loading capacity that resulted from the hydrophobicity of the drug. Here we present a novel drug conjugation chemistry which is based on connecting hydrophobic drugs to the phage via aminoglycoside antibiotics that serve as solubility-enhancing branched linkers. This new formulation allowed a significantly larger drug-carrying capacity of the phages, resulting in a drastic improvement in their performance as targeted drug-carrying nanoparticles. As an example for a potential systemic use for potent agents that are limited for topical use, we present antibody-targeted phage nanoparticles that carry a large payload of the hemolytic antibiotic chloramphenicol connected through the aminoglycoside neomycin. We demonstrate complete growth inhibition toward the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli with an improvement in potency by a factor of approximately 20,000 compared to the free drug.
TI  - Reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  - Intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and NNC 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. The results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. Combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - Usefulness of immunohistochemical diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens compared with culture and gram stain techniques.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of pneumonia and meningitis.  Because S pneumoniae can colonize the upper respiratory tract and antibiotic treatment may inhibit growth, culture-based diagnosis can be problematic. An immunohistochemical assay using a polyclonal antibody against pneumococci was used to test formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 46 patients for whom bacterial culture results were available. Samples from 26 patients demonstrated pneumococcal antigens in areas of pneumonia, meningitis, or osteomyelitis or within circulating inflammatory cells. Various specimens from 18 patients grew S pneumoniae, whereas 8 had cultures that grew mixed bacteria or had no growth but were polymerase chain reaction-positive for the S pneumoniae Ity A gene. Pneumococcal antigens were not present in 20 cases (7 grew Streptococcus pyogenes; 9, Staphylococcus aureus; and 4, Haemophilus influenzae). Compared with culture, the immunohistochemical assay showed 100% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Immunohistochemical analysis has the diagnostic advantage of correlating host inflammatory reaction with presence of pneumococci.
TI  - Increased blood levels of IgG reactive with secreted Streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.
AB  - A pathogenic role for Streptococcus (S) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. We separated cellular and supernatant proteins from S. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma IgGs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. We have shown that a substantial proportion of IgG-reactive proteins from cultured S. pyogenes are secreted. The total secreted protein fraction, including diverse IgG-binding elements, was subsequently used in an ELISA to measure blood titers of reactive IgG. This ELISA showed that blood samples from patients with chronic plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive IgG than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (P=0.0009). In contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin O titers nor ELISAs measuring titers of IgG reactive with protein fractions from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. These findings justify the hypothesis that S. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease.
TI  - [In-vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 18,639 clinical isolates obtained from 77 centers in 2004].
AB  - A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - In vitro activities of oral cephem and telithromycin against clinical isolates of major respiratory pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of oral cephem antibiotics and ketolide telithromycin against major respiratory pathogens possessing beta-lactam-resistant mutations (within the pbp gene) and/or macrolide-resistant genes (erm and mef) were examined in clinical isolates collected at 66 institutes in all over the Japan between 2002 and 2003. Telithromycin showed the strongest antibacterial activity against methicillinsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains with and without macrolide-resistant genes, such as ermA or ermC gene. All the cephem antibiotics showed potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.015 mg/L or lower. Cefdinir had a much higher MIC90 against genotypic penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (gPRSP) than cefditoren and cefcapene (8 mg/L cefdinir vs. 1 mg/L cefditoren and cefcapene). The majority of gPRSP harbored either ermB or mefA, and the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against these strains was decreased however some susceptibility was still sustained. Cefditoren exerted the strongest antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 0.5 mg/L. These results underline the importance of checking the susceptibility and selecting an appropriate antibiotic against target pathogens.
TI  - Oral beta-lactams applied to uncomplicated infections of skin and skin structures.
AB  - Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) include impetigo, erysipelas, folliculitis, simple abscesses, and cellulitis. Their common bacterial causative agents include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Current guidelines predate the widespread occurrences of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as a community-acquired pathogen and include dicloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, all orally, or mupirocin ointment applied topically, for impetigo. For other uSSSI, recommendations are based on the probability of the infection being caused by MRSA. If methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) are known or suspected, the oral agents recommended include clindamycin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). For MRSA, recommended oral agents are linezolid, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and SXT. Because community-acquired MRSA infections now predominate in patients with abscesses in the United States, agents recommended for MRSA should be used for this indication. Local susceptibility patterns should guide empiric therapy. However, no placebo-controlled trials of uSSSI are available, and the evidence used to generate these recommendations is based on comparative noninferiority studies, often with wide noninferiority margins and confidence intervals. The evidence used in developing current guidelines therefore has significant limitations. Further studies, such as superiority outcome studies, placebo-controlled studies, measurement of time to resolution, or other novel approaches, are needed to resolve these treatment dilemmas. Until such studies are performed, the best surrogate available for predicting clinical outcome is application of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles; these describe in vivo drug behavior and allow determination of susceptibility breakpoints for predicting in vivo antimicrobial efficacy via attainment of antimicrobial targets.
TI  - Frequency of recovery of pathogens from the nasopharynx of children with acute maxillary sinusitis before and after the introduction of vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportion of recovery of pathogens in the nasopharynx  of children with acute maxillary sinusitis in the 5 years period before to the 5 years period following the introduction of vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). METHODS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from 428 children with acute maxillary sinusitis, 208 between 1996 and 2000, and 220 between 2001 and 2005. The PCV7 was administered to 174 (79%) of the 220 children seen between 2001 and 2005. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty eight potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 208 children between 1996 and 2000. Organisms were isolated in 114 patients (55%). The predominant organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (59 or 43% of all isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (46 or 33%), Moraxella catarrhalis (18 or 13%), Streptococcus pyogenes (9 or 7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6 or 4%). One hundred and sixty five potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 220 patients between 2001 and 2005. Organisms were isolated in 121 patients (55%). The predominant organisms were H. influenzae non-type b (68 or 41% of all isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (41 or 25%), M. catarrhalis (23 or 14%), Streptococcus pyogenes (20 or 12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (13 or 8%). Significant statistical differences were noted in the rates of recovery of Streptococcus pneumoniae (p<0.05). A decrease occurred in the recovery of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin from 44% between 1997 and 2000 to 27% between 2000 and 2005. An increase was noted in the isolation of beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae from 37% between 1997 and 2000 to 44%. However, neither of these changes was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This data illustrates that a significant shift occurred in the causative pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in children in the 5 years after the introduction of vaccination of children with the PCV7 as compared to the previous 5 years. While the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae declined by 18%, the proportion of H. influenzae increased by 8%.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of PD 0305970 and PD 0326448, new bacterial gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors with potent antibacterial activities versus multidrug-resistant gram-positive and fastidious organism groups.
AB  - PD 0305970 and PD 0326448 are new bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase inhibitors (quinazoline-2,4-diones) that possess outstanding in vitro and in vivo activities against a wide spectrum of bacterial species including quinolone- and multidrug-resistant gram-positive and fastidious organism groups. The respective MICs (microg/ml) for PD 0305970 capable of inhibiting>or=90% of bacterial strains tested ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 versus staphylococci, 0.03 to 0.06 versus streptococci, 0.25 to 2 versus enterococci, and 0.25 to 0.5 versus Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, and Neisseria spp. PD 0326448 MIC90s were generally twofold higher versus these same organism groups. Comparative quinolone MIC90 values were 4- to 512-fold higher than those of PD 0305970. In testing for frequency of resistance, PD 0305970 and levofloxacin showed low levels of development of spontaneous resistant mutants versus both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unlike quinolones, which target primarily gyrA and parC, analysis of resistant mutants in S. pneumoniae indicates that the likely targets of PD 0305970 are gyrB and parE. PD 0305970 demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity by in vitro time-kill testing versus streptococci. This bactericidal activity carried over to in vivo testing, where PD 0305970 and PD 0326448 displayed outstanding Streptococcus pyogenes 50% protective doses (PD50s) (oral dosing) of 0.7 and 3.6 mg/kg, respectively (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin PD50s were>100 and 17.7 mg/kg, respectively). PD 0305970 was also potent in a pneumococcal pneumonia mouse infection model (PD50=3.2 mg/kg) and was 22-fold more potent than levofloxacin.
TI  - [In vitro study to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (Angocin Anti-Infekt N) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba; N) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix; H). This preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (URTI) and urinary tract infections (UTI). The active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. Previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either N or H to possess antibacterial activity. METHODS: In order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. Native preparations of N and H were applied to the lids of Columbia agar plates (ratio N:H = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile H20. Thirteen different bacterial species including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA) were tested (20 isolates each). The test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. The plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees C. Following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (CFU) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (MIC90) was determined for each bacterial species. RESULTS: Relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against H. influenzae (MIC90 50 mg N / 20 mg H), M. catarrhalis (100 mg N / 40 mg H), E. coli (400 mg N / 160 mg H), P aeruginosa (400 mg N / 160 mg H), MSSA (400 mg N 1 160 mg H), MRSA (400 mg N / 160 mg H), and S. pyogenes (400 mg N / 160 mg H). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial testing of a combination of N and H revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of N and H leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved Pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to the previous reported activities of the single compounds. Thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of URTI and UTI with a combination of N and H.
TI  - Horner's syndrome as a complication of acute otitis media.
AB  - A seventeen-year-old girl presented with acute otitis media, unilateral miosis and ptosis (partial Horner's syndrome) and tenderness of the ipsilateral jugular vein. A culture of the otorrhoea showed Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A CT scan revealed an infiltrate near the ipsilateral carotid artery and jugular vein. The patient was hospitalised and treated with antibiotics. Clinical signs disappeared within 6 days. This report discusses the first case with a partial Horner's syndrome as an unusual complication of acute otitis media (AOM). Imaging studies suggest extracranial lymphatic spread of the infection along the adjacent jugular vein causing pressure on the postsynaptic sympathetic fibres. Recognition of the Horner's syndrome is of importance because it may be an early sign of an extracranial complication of AOM.
TI  - Does the presence of crystal arthritis rule out septic arthritis?
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of septic arthritis in the presence of joint crystals. A retrospective study was conducted at a university tertiary care referral center. The study population included all patients with synovial fluid crystals in the joint aspirate sent to the laboratory during the 7-year study period. Septic arthritis was defined as a positive synovial culture. Of the 265 joint aspirates containing crystals, 183 (69.0%) contained gout crystals, 81 (30.6%) contained pseudogout crystals, and 1 (0.4%) contained both. Four (1.5%) of the aspirates had positive cultures. The mean synovial WBC of the 4 samples with concomitant crystals and septic arthritis was 113,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 72,700-153,200), which was significantly higher than the entire population at 23,200 (95% CI 19,400-27,000; p < 0.01). Of note, all 4 patients with concomitant disease had significant co-morbidities and synovial WBC counts greater than 50,000. Septic arthritis and acute crystal-induced arthritis can occur simultaneously; there were 4 cases (1.5%) of concomitant disease in our study population. The presence of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and resistance development profiling of dalbavancin.
AB  - Dalbavancin, a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide being developed for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs), has a half-life of 5 to 7 days in humans and offers promise for a convenient weekly dosing regimen. We studied the in vitro bactericidal activity of dalbavancin against target organisms, using the concentrations that are maintained in human blood with the proposed dosage regimen. Dalbavancin minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were<or=0.5 microg/ml for eight staphylococcal isolates; and for six of these strains, including one vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) isolate, the MBCs were equal to or within 1 doubling dilution of the MIC. Dalbavancin MICs for all three Streptococcus pyogenes strains were 0.008 microg/ml, as were the MBCs for two of the isolates. In time-kill studies conducted with a different set of seven strains (two methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, three methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates, one VISA isolate, and one S. pyogenes isolate), all strains exhibited a>or=3-log10 decrease in their viable counts when they were exposed to>or=1 microg/ml of dalbavancin for 24 h. Resistance development studies by both direct selection (resistance frequency, <10(-10)) and serial passage failed to produce stable mutants with decreased susceptibility to dalbavancin. These observations suggest that dalbavancin will be an effective choice for the management of patients with SSSIs.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis caused by group a streptococcus.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is a rare disease that is most often caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and anaerobic bacteria. We present an unusual case of purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococcus (GAS), and we provide a review of the literature.
TI  - Efficacy of N-acetyl-cysteine in combination with thiamphenicol in sequential (intramuscular/aerosol) therapy of upper respiratory tract infections even when sustained by bacterial biofilms.
AB  - A total of 102 patients with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections underwent microbiological exploration with appropriate sampling and direct biopsies of the infected sites. Therapy was then started and on day 1 each patient received two intramuscular injections of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA). From day 2 to 10 sequential therapy with the same drug was continued employing TGA administered by aerosol. All putative etiologic agents recovered were susceptible to thiamphenicol and only 24 demonstrated the ability to produce in vitro biofilms. The organisms comprised 10 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 3 Haemophilus influenzae. Of the 24 subjects in whom biofilms were demonstrated to be present in vivo by Scanning Electron Microscopy, clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 21 cases (87.5%) following sequential therapy with TGA. Failures were considered to be persistent signs and symptoms at day 15 after initiation of treatment and lack of eradication of 3 S. aureus strains, despite their in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol. Very few adverse events attributable to TGA were reported in this cohort of patients. In no case was discontinuation of treatment deemed necessary by the attending physician.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - Primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. Although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. This article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, hair follicle-associated infections (ie, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles) erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, and tenosynovitis.

TI  - Topical ethyl chloride fine spray. Does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (Cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. The plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. RESULTS: The model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. The estimate of the percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. There was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). CONCLUSION: The use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. The authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. This coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.
TI  - Topical retapamulin ointment (1%, wt/wt) twice daily for 5 days versus oral cephalexin twice daily for 10 days in the treatment of secondarily infected dermatitis: results of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New antibacterial agents with activity against pathogenic strains resistant to established antibiotics are needed to treat patients with secondarily infected dermatitis (SID). OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of SID. METHODS: Patients with SID were randomly assigned to retapamulin ointment 1% (twice daily [bid]) for 5 days, or oral cephalexin (500 mg bid) for 10 days. The primary efficacy end point was clinical response at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included microbiologic response at follow-up, safety, and compliance. RESULTS: Retapamulin was as effective as cephalexin (clinical success rates at follow-up: 85.9% and 89.7%, respectively). Microbiologic success rates at follow-up were 87.2% for retapamulin and 91.8% for cephalexin. Retapamulin was well tolerated and the topical formulation was preferred over the oral drug. LIMITATIONS: An imbalance existed in the number of patients with the clinical outcome "unable to determine" (15 retapamulin, 2 cephalexin), mainly because of their failure to attend the study visit. If those who failed to attend visits (who did not withdraw as a result of drug-related events) are removed from the analysis, the clinical success rates are 89.9% for retapamulin and 89.7% for cephalexin. CONCLUSIONS: Retapamulin ointment 1% (bid) for 5 days was as effective as oral cephalexin (bid) for 10 days in treatment of patients with SID, and was well tolerated.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Use of the surgical wound infection model to determine the efficacious dosing regimen of retapamulin, a novel topical antibiotic.
AB  - The effect of topically applied retapamulin ointment was evaluated using various  dosing regimens in the Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes wound infection model. Retapamulin (1%, wt/wt) was efficacious using twice-daily (b.i.d.) applications for 4 or 5 days. These data underpinned the decision to evaluate 1% retapamulin b.i.d. in clinical trials.
TI  - Selection of retapamulin, a novel pleuromutilin for topical use.
AB  - The in vitro activity of retapamulin was determined and compared to that of topical and community antibiotics. The MIC(90)s of retapamulin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.12 microg/ml and 0.016 microg/ml, respectively. Retapamulin has a low propensity to select resistance and produces an in vitro postantibiotic effect.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - Nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. One important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of S. aureus among hospital personnel. There are only a few studies investigating the carriage of S. aureus in a community of medical students. Oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. Oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of S. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. Methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of EMLA and lidocaine in wound tissue biopsies for culturing.
AB  - If a tissue biopsy from a chronic wound is sampled for culture, the antibacterial properties of local anesthetics may pose a problem in producing false-negative results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of EMLA (AstraZeneca) and lidocaine on common wound pathogenic bacteria. An in vitro study of a total of 25 clinical isolates and ATCC reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes was conducted. The isolates were exposed to the local anesthetic drugs (and some of their contents separately) at 35 degrees C over a 24-hour period and time-kill curves were recorded. No culture media were used and saline was used for controls. EMLA was found to have a rapid acting and powerful antibacterial effect and should not be used before culturing tissue samples. Lidocaine 1% was found not to inhibit the bacterial strains when exposure time was held below 2 hours. We conclude that culturing tissue from a wound biopsy is safe within 2 hours when a pure, preservative-free lidocaine 1% solution is used.
TI  - Competition of bacteriophage polypeptides with native replicase proteins for binding to the DNA sliding clamp reveals a novel mechanism for DNA replication arrest in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacteriophages have evolved specific mechanisms that redirect bacterial metabolic pathways to the bacteriophage reproduction cycle. In this study, we characterized the bactericidal mechanism of two polypeptides from bacteriophages Twort and G1 that target the DNA sliding clamp of Staphylococcus aureus. The DNA sliding clamp, which tethers DNA polymerase to its template and thereby confers processivity upon the enzyme, was found to be essential for the viability of S. aureus. Expression of polypeptides TwortORF168 and G1ORF240 in S. aureus selectively inhibited DNA replication which in turn resulted in cell death. Both polypeptides specifically inhibited the S. aureus DNA replicase that was reconstituted in vitro but not the corresponding replicase of Streptococcus pyogenes. We demonstrated that inhibition of DNA synthesis is multifaceted and occurs via binding the DNA sliding clamp: TwortORF168 and G1ORF240 bound tightly to the DNA sliding clamp and prevented both its loading onto DNA and its interaction with DNA polymerase C. These results elucidate the impact of bacteriophage polypeptide expression upon DNA replication in the growing cell.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract.
AB  - The rapidly developing resistance of many infectious pathogenic organisms to modern drugs has spurred scientists to search for new sources of antibacterial compounds. One potential candidate, bDLE (dialysis at 10 to 12 kDa cut-off) and its fractions ("S" and "L" by 3.5 kDa cut-off and I, II, III, and IV by molecular exclusion chromatography), was evaluated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Lysteria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi) using standard antimicrobial assays. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bDLE and its fractions was determined by agar and broth dilutions methods. Only bDLE and its "S" fraction had an effect upon all bacteria evaluated (MIC ranging from 0.29 to 0.62 U/ml), and the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects (evaluated by MTT assay) were bacterial species-dependent. These results showed a remarkable in vitro antibacterial property of bDLE against several pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Infective pyomyositis and myositis in children in the era of community-acquired,  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cases of pyomyositis and myositis have been increasing in frequency at Texas Children's Hospital (Houston) since 2000. The increase appears to correlate with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: The medical records of patients with pyomyositis and myositis hospitalized at Texas Children's Hospital during the period from January 2000 through December 2005 were reviewed. Available S. aureus isolates were obtained for susceptibility testing, to determine the presence of pvl (lukS-PV and lukF-PV), and for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. RESULTS: Forty-five previously healthy children with bacterial pyomyositis or myositis were analyzed. The causes were S. aureus (in 57.8% of children) and Streptococcus pyogenes (in 2.2%); 40.0% of children had negative culture results. The number of cases increased between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of an increase in the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. The mean patient age was 5.5 years (range, 0.06-15 years). The thigh (40.0% of children) and pelvis (28.9%) were the most commonly affected sites. The mean abscess diameter was 3.5 cm. Eighteen children required at least 1 muscle drainage procedure. Of the 24 available S. aureus isolates (15 community-acquired MRSA isolates and 9 community-acquired, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] isolates), 16 were found to be USA300 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and 17 carried pvl. Patients with community-acquired MRSA, USA300, and/or pvl-positive strains required more drainage procedures than did those with community-acquired MSSA, non-USA300, and/or pvl-negative strains (81% vs. 40% [P=.05], 82% vs. 29% [P=.02], and 81% vs. 38% [P=.07], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired MRSA is an increasing cause of pyomyositis and myositis in children. Community-acquired MRSA, USA300, pvl-positive S. aureus isolates caused more severe disease than did community-acquired MSSA, non-USA300, and pvl-negative isolates, respectively.
TI  - Sigma X induces competence gene expression in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Although not thought to become competent for DNA uptake, the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes appears to encode within its genome the DNA uptake and recombination machinery required for competence. The promoters of these genes contain a conserved sequence, CIN-box, which is recognized by the S. pyogenes alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor X. Using microarray technology, we found that sigma X induced the expression of competence genes in S. pyogenes. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm that the expression of these transcripts was induced 2-265-fold by sigma X. Of the eight CIN-box loci induced, femB, the ortholog a virulence factor in Staphylococcus aureus, was shown to be transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase containing sigma X, indicating that sigma X directly activates expression of this CIN-box gene. Sigma X-dependent induction of genes encoding competence machinery in S. pyogenes raises the possibility that some strains of this human pathogen can develop competence for genetic transformation.
TI  - Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days vs oral cephalexin twice daily for 10 days for empiric treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions of the skin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Retapamulin is a novel, topical antibacterial of the pleuromutilin  class in development for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions of the skin. METHODS: The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical retapamulin ointment, 1% for 5 days twice daily was evaluated in 2 identical, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter studies vs oral cephalexin, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, in 1904 patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions. RESULTS: Clinical success rates were 89.5% in protocol-adherent patients receiving retapamulin compared with 91.9% for cephalexin (treatment difference, -2.5% [95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 0.5%]). In patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes at baseline, clinical success was 89.2% (365/409) for retapamulin and 92.6% (63/68) for cephalexin. Safety and tolerability were similar between treatments. Noncompliance (defined as using or taking <80% of doses) was recorded in 8.0% (51/636) of patients taking cephalexin compared with 0.39% (5/1268) of patients receiving retapamulin. CONCLUSIONS: Retapamulin offers a novel, effective, and convenient topical treatment for secondarily infected traumatic lesions.
TI  - Visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) substrates is induced primarily by UV light irradiation. Recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. Their antibacterial activity, however, remains to be quantified. In this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli compared to pure TiO(2) and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates. We also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. In the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates than by pure TiO(2) substrates. These findings suggest that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.
TI  - Autophagy in innate immunity against intracellular bacteria.
AB  - Many pathogenic bacteria can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and colonize them intracellularly, then become disseminated to other cells. The endocytic degradation pathway is thought to be the only prevention against such intracellular pathogens. Autophagy, a fundamental cellular homeostasis pathway that operates with the intracellular degradation/recycling system, causes the turnover of cellular components by delivering portions of the cytoplasm and organelles to lysosomes. Recently, we reported that autophagic degradation is a previously unrecognized effector of host innate immunity. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS) successfully enters human epithelial cells via endocytosis. GAS immediately escapes from the endosomes to the cytoplasm and gains a replicative niche, after which GAS in the cytoplasm is trapped in autophagosome-like compartments and degraded upon fusion with lysosomes. This process indicates that autophagy plays a protective role in infectious diseases. We also found that autophagic degradation was induced against Staphylococcus aureus, while methicillin-resistant S. aureus were resistant to autophagic degradation. The present review focuses on the protective function of autophagy against bacterial invasion of cells.
TI  - As a bacterial culture medium, citrated sheep blood agar is a practical alternative to citrated human blood agar in laboratories of developing countries.
AB  - Human blood agar (HuBA) is widely used in developing countries for the isolation  of bacteria from clinical specimens. This study compared citrated sheep blood agar (CSBA) and HuBA with defibrinated horse blood agar and defibrinated sheep blood agar (DSBA) for the isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing of reference and clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reference and clinical strains of all organisms were diluted in brain heart infusion and a clinical specimen of cerebrospinal fluid and cultured on all agars. Viable counts, colony morphology, and colony size were recorded. Susceptibility testing for S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes was performed on defibrinated sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar, citrated sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar (CSB MHA), and human blood Mueller-Hinton agar plates. For all organisms, the colony numbers were similar on all agars. Substantially smaller colony sizes and absent or minimal hemolysis were noted on HuBA for all organisms. Antibiotic susceptibility results for S. pneumoniae were similar for the two sheep blood agars; however, larger zone sizes were displayed on HuBA, and quality control for the reference strain failed on HuBA. For S. pyogenes, larger zone sizes were demonstrated on HuBA and CSBA than on DSBA. Poor hemolysis made interpretation of the zone sizes difficult on HuBA. CSBA is an acceptable alternative for the isolation of these organisms. The characteristic morphology is not evident, and hemolysis is poor on HuBA; and so HuBA is not recommended for use for the isolation or the susceptibility testing of any of these organisms. CSB MHA may be suitable for use for the susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Immunohistochemical evidence of Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, and group  A Streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  - Severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (IHC) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft tissue infections in Scotland and Ireland in 2000. The IHC assays used antibodies against Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Bacillus anthracis. Intact bacilli and granular Clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. A variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 IHC-positive cases. Staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where S aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. Group A streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which Streptococcus pyogenes and S aureus were isolated. By using IHC, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. Immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as Clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.
TI  - [Prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in nasopharynx of healthy children attending a day care center in Havana City].
AB  - During the first six-month period of 2001, a descriptive cross-sectional study of carriage in healthy children attending a day-care center in Havana City was performed. The objective was to find out the prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and its association with possible risk factors. The design took into account the international and domestic regulatory bioethical requirements. Swabs of posterior nasopharynx of 160 children were directly cultured in brain heart agar plus sheep blood and in brain heart agar plus NAD, hemine and bacitracin and incubated for 18-24 h. Resulting isolates were identified using conventional techniques and the API NH system. Male children aged 3-4 years were predominant. A high percentage of nasopharyngeal carriage was detected; Haemophilus was isolated in 92.50% of cases, being Haemophilus influenzae present in 54.72% of children. Other pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolythic Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis. A statistically significant difference was observed when comparing S. pneumoniae carriage and non-carriage in less than 2 years-old children. The colonizing patterns of potentially pathogenic bacteria were disclosed in children attending a day care center in Havana City.
TI  - How do microbes evade neutrophil killing?
AB  - Many microbial pathogens evolved to circumvent the attack of neutrophils, which are essential effector cells of the innate immune system. Here we review six major strategies that pathogenic bacteria and fungi use to evade neutrophil defences: (i) turning on survival and stress responses, (ii) avoiding contact, (iii) preventing phagocytosis, (iv) surviving intracellularly, (v) inducing cell death and (vi) evading killing by neutrophil extracellular traps. For each category we give examples and further focus on one particular pathogenic microbe in more detail. Pathogens include Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Yersinia ssp., Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Optimal management of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections of the lower extremity.
AB  - Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections of the lower extremity are almost always curable when properly diagnosed and promptly treated with antibiotics, but they can cause serious complications if not treated appropriately. These infections are caused often by Staphylococcus aureus and less commonly by Streptococcus pyogenes. Initial treatment is usually empiric. Although the most suitable oral treatment is likely cephalosporin, other options include beta-lactamase inhibitor-penicillin combinations and penicillinase-resistant penicillins. In some cases, incision and drainage or debridement may be required.
TI  - How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.
TI  - Development of a broad-range 16S rDNA real-time PCR for the diagnosis of septic arthritis in children.
AB  - The broad-range PCR has been successfully developed to search for fastidious, slow-growing or uncultured bacteria, and is mostly used when an empirical antibiotic treatment has already been initiated. The technique generally involves standard PCR targeting the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, and includes a post-PCR visualisation step on agarose gel which is a potential source of cross-over contamination. In addition, interpretation of the presence of amplified products on gels can be difficult. We then developed a new SYBR Green-based, universal real-time PCR assay targeting the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, coupled with sequencing of amplified products. The real-time PCR assay was evaluated on 94 articular fluid samples collected from children hospitalised for suspicion of septic arthritis, as compared to the results obtained with bacterial cultures and conventional broad-range PCR. DNA extraction was performed with the automated MagNa Pure system. We could detect DNA from various bacterial pathogens including fastidious bacteria (Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus aureus) from 23% of cases of septic arthritis giving negative culture results. The real-time technique was easier to interpret and allowed to detect four more cases than conventional PCR. PCR based molecular techniques appear to be essential to perform in case of suspicion of septic arthritis, provided the increase of the diagnosed bacterial etiologies. Real-time PCR technique is a sensitive and reliable technique, which can replace conventional PCR for clinical specimens with negative bacterial culture.
TI  - Severe acute middle ear infections: microbiology and treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The database at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital describing the specific local flora of acute otitis media (AOM) and acute mastoiditis (AM) in Aarhus County has become the key element in securing a rational and specific antibiotic treatment. We present our data concerning AOM, mastoidismus and AM. Our purpose is to determine (I) clinical presentation, (II) causative pathogens, (III) resistance patterns, (IV) type of antibiotic treatment, and (V) accuracy of the antibiotic treatment. METHODS: Patients under the age of 18 years, treated for AOM with extensive affected well-being and AM, at the ENT-Department, Aarhus University Hospital during 3 years from January 2001 to December 2003. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were identified. Sixty-seven patients with AOM and 39 patients with AM. The overall bacterial flora found is dominated by S. pneumococci all 100% susceptible to penicillin. However, Staphylococcus aureus is the primary bacterial pathogens cultured from patients treated with preadmission antibiotics. CONCLUSION: If a specimen from an AOM patient is obtained after the initiation of antibiotic treatment one should consider the possibility of the culture found being a result of the initial led treatment and not the causative AOM pathogen. Our data suggest that a restricted use of antibiotics in children with AOM may be associated with a higher incidence of acute mastoiditis. Significant higher leucocytes count and CRP are found in the acute mastoiditis group compared to the AOM group.
TI  - Lytic rib lesion in a 1-year-old child: group A beta streptococcal osteomyelitis  mimicking tumor.
AB  - Pediatric osteomyelitis commonly occurs in the long bones and has rarely been reported in small bones such as the vertebrae and ribs. Rib osteomyelitis occurs in approximately 1% or less of all cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis, and is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We present a case of acute osteomyelitis in the rib of an otherwise healthy and afebrile 1-year-old infant that appeared as a lytic bone lesion on imaging studies and was mistaken for a tumor. Biopsy was needed to rule out malignancy and establish the diagnosis of osteomyelitis caused by group A Streptococcus. This is one of the few reported cases of pediatric rib osteomyelitis caused by this organism.
TI  - [Etiology and rational therapy of severe otitis media purulenta acuta in children].
AB  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogens of otitis media purulenta acuta in children was studied within 2000-2005. A total of 161 children at the age of 1 to 14 years were examined. The middle ear discharge collected during paracentosis (79.5%) or spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (20.5%) was used in the bacteriological tests. The microflora growth in the culture was detected in 80% of the cases. The leading pathogen was Streptococcus pyogenes (47.5%), the part of Streptococcus pneumoniae amounted to 36.6% of all the etiologically significant microflora, the part of Staphylococcus aureus amounted to 6.9% and that of Haemophilus influenzae amounted to 4.0%. The part of the associations of 2 microorganisms equaled 5.0%. The species composion of the pathogens differed from that described in the literature. The isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were characterized by low resistance to macrolides (4.0-6.3%). As for the S. pneumoniae isolates, 97.3% of them was susceptible to penicillin. The results of the etiology study and the pathogen antibiotic susceptibility showed that the drugs of choice for the empirical antibacterial therapy of otitis media purulenta acuta in children should be amoxicillin and 1st generation cepholosporins. When the antibacterial therapy within the first 3 days fails, it is advisable to use protected aminopenicillins or 2nd generation cephalosporins. In case of the drug intolerance, macrolide antibiotics should be used.
TI  - Community-acquired bloodstream infections in children > one month old in southern Israel (1992-2001): epidemiological, clinical and microbiological aspects.
AB  - We studied the epidemiology, microbiology, clinical picture and outcome of community-acquired bloodstream infections (CABI) in children in southern Israel during 1992-2001. Information was collected prospectively by daily surveillance. CABI was diagnosed when a positive blood culture was reported in a patient discharged from the emergency room or during <48 h since admission if hospitalized. There were 1439 CABI episodes in 1396 children aged 1 month to 14 y. CABI incidence was 100/100,000 children with no increase during the study period. Risk of CABI was 3.8 times higher in a Bedouin than in a Jewish child. 1561 bacteria (793, 50%, gram-positive and 768, 49% gram-negative organisms, respectively) and 13 fungi were recovered. Most frequent gram-positive organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (509 isolates, 32% of all isolates, 64% of all gram-positive), Staphylococcus aureus (137, 9%, 17%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (46, 3%, 6%). Enterobacteriaceae spp. were the most frequent gram-negative pathogens (279, 18%, 36%), followed by Brucella (205, 13%, 27%). S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in children <12 months and 1-5 y age; Brucella was the most frequent pathogen in children >5 y of age. Coverage of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine for CABI was 38.5%. 38 (2.7%) patients died; 16 cases were caused by S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Increased recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae in association with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in healthy children and those with pharyngo-tonsillitis.
AB  - The inflamed tonsils harbour numerous types of bacteria, alone or in combination  with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). The cohabitation of the tonsils by GABHS and certain other bacterial species may contribute to the inflammatory process and the failure of penicillin therapy. This study evaluated the recovery of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in association with GABHS in healthy children and those with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis (APT). Pharyngo-tonsillar cultures were obtained from 548 children with APT and 866 healthy children. GABHS was recovered from 112 (20.4%) children with APT. Of the 114 H. influenzae isolates, 32 were recovered in association with GABHS (29% of all patients who had GABHS) and 82 were isolated without GABHS (19%) (P=0.0267). Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 25 were recovered in association with GABHS (22% of all patients who had GABHS) and 44 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.0012). In contrast, there was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of Staph. aureus or Strep. pneumoniae. GABHS was recovered from 104 (12%) healthy children. Of the 69 M. catarrhalis isolates, 24 were recovered in association with GABHS (23% of all patients who had GABHS) and 80 were isolated without GABHS (10%) (P=0.006). There was no association between the isolation of GABHS and the recovery of H. influenzae, Staph. aureus or Strep. pneumoniae. This study demonstrates an association between the recovery of GABHS and H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of patients with APT and M. catarrhalis from pharyngo-tonsillar cultures of healthy children.
TI  - Evaluation of phytoconstituents of Terminalia arjuna for wound healing activity in rats.
AB  - The effect of topical application of phytoconstituents (fraction I, II and III) fractionated from a hydroalcohol extract of the bark of the plant, Terminalia arjuna, was assessed on the healing of rat dermal wounds using in vivo models. The results indicated a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength of the incision wounds and the percent epithelialization of excision wounds compared with control (p < 0.05). However, topical treatment with fraction I, consisting mainly of tannins, was found to demonstrate a maximum increase in the tensile strength of incision wounds. Even with respect to excision wounds, the fastest rate of epithelialization was seen with fraction I. Hexosamine estimation of granulation tissue obtained from excision wounds revealed an increase in the hexosamine content with fraction I compared with the control. In addition, fraction I from the hydroalcohol extract of Arjuna bark possessed antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes but not Candida albicans. These results strongly document the beneficial effects of fraction I, consisting mainly of tannins, of Terminalia arjuna in the acceleration of the healing process. Thus, the present study validates the claim made with respect to the plant as well as corroborating the astringent effect of tannins by drawing the tissues closer together.
TI  - Coenzyme Q10 production in recombinant Escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  - In the present work, Escherichia coli DH5alpha was metabolically engineered for CoQ(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Grown in 2YTG medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial pH of 7, the recombinant E. coli was capable of CoQ(10) production up to 470 microg/gDCW (dry cell weight). This value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gDCW simply by increasing the initial culture pH from 7 to 9. Supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. However, engineering of a lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the CoQ(10) production. Lower mevalonate semi-pathways of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Among these, the pathway of Streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding CoQ(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gDCW when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mM. In order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. In a recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as DdsA enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-CoA to IPP, resulting in CoQ(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gDCW, without mevalonate supplementation. In contrast, a whole mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. However, it provided CoQ(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gDCW, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsA alone.
TI  - Activity of retapamulin (SB-275833), a novel pleuromutilin, against selected resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Retapamulin (SB-275833), the first pleuromutilin to be developed for human topical use, was tested against a selected population of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci. The MIC90 results for retapamulin were 0.12 microg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and < or = 0.03 microg/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes; no cross-resistance was observed for organism subsets resistant to oxacillin, erythromycin, or mupirocin.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.
TI  - Lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  - Seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group A Streptococcus, group B Streptococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). All surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds. The average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). No clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. Since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. The use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising fasciitis was easy and effective. Local or systemic infection was negligible.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding proteins of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Cell wall-attached fibronectin-binding proteins are important multifunctional virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This review describes recent advances in the understanding of the function of these proteins on a molecular level and of their role in infections.
TI  - Therapeutic experience with cefdinir in the treatment of uSSSIs.
AB  - Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (uSSSIs) are common community-acquired infections which are often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, although other pathogens are often involved. A recent treatment algorithm has recommended the use of cephalosporins as an appropriate antibiotic therapy for uSSSIs and, in particular, highlighted cefdinir as an extended-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin with good antimicrobial activity and favourable tolerability. This case report briefly reviews the rationale for the use of cefdinir in the treatment of uSSSIs and presents two case studies to highlight the clinical use of this agent.
TI  - Frequency of recovery of pathogens causing acute maxillary sinusitis in adults before and after introduction of vaccination of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the proportions of the recovery of pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 4-year period prior to the 5-year period that followed the introduction of vaccination of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7). Cultures were obtained through endoscopy from 385 adults with acute maxillary sinusitis, 156 between 1997 and 2000, and 229 between 2001 and 2005. One hundred and seventeen potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 1997 and 2000. The predominant organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (54 or 46 % of all isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (42 or 36 %), Moraxella catarrhalis (7 or 6 %), Streptococcus pyogenes (8 or 7 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 or 5 %). One hundred and sixty-seven potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from the cultures obtained between 2001 and 2005. The most predominant organisms were H. influenzae non-type b (71 or 43 % of all isolates), Strep. pneumoniae (58 or 35 %), M. catarrhalis (13 or 8 %), Strep. pyogenes (12 or 7 %) and Staph. aureus (13 or 8 %). Significant statistical differences were noted in the rates of recovery of H. influenzae non-type b (P < 0.05) and Strep. pneumoniae (P < 0.05). A decrease occurred in the recovery of Strep. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin from 41 to 29 %, and an increase was noted in the isolation of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae from 33 to 39 %; however, neither change was statistically significant. These data illustrate that a significant shift occurred in the causative pathogens of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in the 5 years after the introduction of vaccination of children with the PCV7 compared to the previous 4 years.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. This study examine two samples of clove obtained from Sri Lanka and Zanzibar and two samples of thyme from Iran and Oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. METHOD: The active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium species, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: All oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested. Their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against S. aureus. The lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using Candida albicans. There was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from Sri Lanka or Zanzibar or thyme obtained from Iran or Oman. CONCLUSION: Our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. However, further work is necessary to ascertain why Candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.
TI  - In vitro activities of DX-619 and comparison quinolones against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel quinolone DX-619 was compared to those of currently available quinolones against U.S. clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. DX-619 was the most potent quinolone overall, indicating possible utility as an anti-gram-positive quinolone.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "Dentavax".
AB  - The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis.
AB  - Mastoiditis (M) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. The incidence of M has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. In the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute M in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute M. Several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. However, because P. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic M. Anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. Management of uncomplicated M requires the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. If no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. The procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. Radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.
TI  - [Present situation of antibiotic resistances in tonsillar infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain the main responsible organisms, its sensitivity and resistances to antibiotics in tonsillitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied the post-surgical tonsils, carrying out a microbiologic study, its culture and sensitivity. RESULTS: The most frequent isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (29.3%), followed by Streptococcus pyogenes (23.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (12.1%). The highest resistances were for the S. aureus (penicillin 91%, erythromycin 18% and 5% to the rest of the beta-lactams), followed by H. influenzae (50% clarithromycin, 30% amoxyciIlin and 2% cephalosporins) and S. pyogenes (28% erytromycin, 10% clindamycin and 3% penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: We noticed the minimal resistance found to cephalosporins, and for this reason they appear to be the safest option, except in children under five years old, in which amoxicillin is still the first line treatment, because the causative agent is S. pyogenes, sensitive to that antibiotic.
TI  - [Aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  - The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Study of upper respiratory tract bacterial flora: first report. Variations in upper respiratory tract bacterial flora in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infection and healthy subjects and variations by subject age.
AB  - With the appearance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, there has been increasing debate concerning antimicrobial treatments for acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and acute otitis media in children. This study compares the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with AURTI (AURTI group; 710 subjects) and healthy subjects (HS group; 380 subjects). The comparisons were made between subjects aged 6 years or younger (0-6 subgroup: 330 subjects), between 7 and 74 years (7-74 subgroup: 668 subjects), and 75 years and older (92 subjects), because the subjects were subgrouped as described above dependent on the maturity of the protective immunity. In the HS group 7-74 subgroup, viridans group streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium sp. with a detection rate of 10% or more were classified as normal nasal flora (NNF), and Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were classified as drum cavity pathogens (DCP). In the 0-6 subgroup, although the detection rate for DCP bacteria in the AURTI group tended to be high, it did not reach a significant difference, whereas the detection rate for NNF bacteria was significantly lower. This trend was also observed to some degree in the other age subgroup. In the 0-6 subgroup, leukocyte infiltration observed with a microscope indicated the closest relationship between S. pneumoniae detection rate and detection quantity. These results suggest that in the 0-6 subgroup the tendency for patients with AURTI to have NNF bacteria as well as DCP bacteria should be taken into consideration.
TI  - [Characterization of soy peptone for the culture of microorganisms].
AB  - A soy peptone obtained with enzyme papain as a hydrolyzing agent was characterized. The physicochemical evaluation of the nutritive base attained at pilot and industrial scale showed the following characteristics: loss due to desiccation, 1.93%; aminic nitrogen, 1.71%; total nitrogen, 8.63%; chlorides (as NaCl), 5.45%; and pH, 6.94. For the functional evaluation of the pilot and industrial batches (3), developed soy peptone and another one taken as a reference from the Biotecnica Internacional firm (Mexico), was incorporated to a mixture of bases. There were no significant differences (p < 0.05) in the absorbance values at 640 nm obtained in the promotion of the growth between the developed product and that of reference for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. For Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, it was observed a mild superiority (significant difference for p < 0.05) starting from the 5th hour of incubation in favor of the industrial batches compared with the reference soy peptone. It was proved that the promotion of the growth in the soy triptone agar and broth media and in malt extract agar for the evaluated microorganisms was similar or higher (significant differences for p < 0.05) in those prepared with the experimental soy peptone, in comparison with the formulated with the reference base.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial epoxide isolated from larval Galleria mellonella infected by the nematode symbiont, Photorhabdus luminescens (Enterobacteriaceae).
AB  - A novel antimicrobial epoxide, 2-isopropyl-5-(3-phenyl-oxiranyl)-benzene-1,3-diol (1), was identified from larval Galleria mellonella infected by a symbiotically associated bacterium-nematode complex (Photorhabdus luminescens C9-Heterorhabditis megidis 90). Its structure was determined with spectroscopic analysis and confirmed by chemical synthesis starting from a known antibiotic, 2-isopropyl-5-(2-phenylethenyl)-benzene-1,3-diol (2). Epoxide 1 was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and a drug-resistant, clinical strain of Staphylococcus aureus (RN4220) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 6.25-12.5 microg/ml. Epoxide 1 was cytotoxic against human cancer cell lines, MCF-7 wt, H460, and Jurkat, with GI(50) of 2.14, 0.63, and 0.42 microM, respectively, but was less toxic on normal, mouse splenic lymphocytes with a GI(50) of 45.00 microM.
TI  - Activity of retapamulin against Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus  evaluated by agar dilution, microdilution, E-test, and disk diffusion methodologies.
AB  - The in vitro activity of retapamulin against 106 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 109 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was evaluated by the agar dilution, broth microdilution, E-test, and disk diffusion methodologies. Where possible, the tests were performed by using the CLSI methodology. The results of agar dilution, broth microdilution, and E-test (all with incubation in ambient air) for S. aureus yielded similar MICs, in the range of 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml. These values corresponded to zone diameters between 25 and 33 mm by the use of a 2-microg retapamulin disk. Overall, 99% of the agar dilution results and 95% of E-test results for S. aureus were within +/-1 dilution of the microdilution results. For S. pyogenes, the MICs obtained by the agar and broth microdilution methods (both after incubation in ambient air) were in the range of 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml, and E-test MICs (with incubation in ambient air) were 0.016 to 0.06 microg/ml. For S. pyogenes, 100% of the agar dilution MIC results were within +/-1 dilution of the broth microdilution results. E-test MICs (after incubation in ambient air) were within +/-1 and +/-2 dilutions of the broth microdilution results for 76% and 99% of the isolates, respectively. E-test MICs for S. pyogenes strains in CO(2) were up to 4 dilutions higher than those in ambient air. Therefore, it is recommended that when retapamulin MICs are determined by E-test, incubation be done in ambient air and not in CO(2), due to the adverse effect of CO(2) on the activity of this compound. Diffusion zones (with incubation in CO(2)) for S. pyogenes were 18 to 24 mm. Retapamulin MICs for all strains by all methods (with incubation in ambient air) were < or =0.25 microg/ml. These results demonstrate that S. pyogenes (including macrolide-resistant strains) and S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-nonsusceptible strains) are inhibited by very low concentrations of retapamulin and that all four testing methods are satisfactory for use for susceptibility testing.
TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of telithromycin and azithromycin on nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin compared with azithromycin in eradicating S pneumoniae from the nasopharynx of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis. The growing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and macrolides brought about the development of a new class of antibiotics-the ketolides-that are effective against resistant pneumococci. SETTING: Otolaryngology clinic. PATIENTS: One-hundred five patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. INTERVENTIONS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained before therapy and 10 to 12 days after initiation of treatment. Fifty-nine patients were treated with 500 mg of azithromycin daily for 3 days and 46 were treated with 800 mg of telithromycin daily for 5 days. RESULTS: Sixty-seven potential pathogens were recovered prior to initiation of therapy in 57 patients, 32 treated with telithromycin and 25 treated with azithromycin: S pneumoniae (31 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (non-type b) (13), Staphylococcus aureus (8), Streptococcus pyogenes (8), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7). The distribution of the pathogens was similar in both groups. The number of S pneumoniae isolates in the azithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 14 to 8 (43% reduction), and 5 of these 8 isolates were resistant to azithromycin. In contrast, the number of S pneumoniae isolates in the telithromycin group was reduced following treatment from 17 to 1 (94% reduction) (P < .01). This isolate was susceptible to azithromycin and telithromycin. No differences were noted in the eradication rate of all of the other potential pathogens, which were all susceptible to both azithromycin and telithromycin. Development of resistance to the antimicrobial agents used (defined as increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration by at least 2 tubes) was found only in 5 isolates (4 S pneumoniae and 1 H influenzae) recovered only from patients who received azithromycin (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the superiority of telithromycin to azithromycin in the eradication of S pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Protease-stable polycationic photosensitizer conjugates between polyethyleneimine and chlorin(e6) for broad-spectrum antimicrobial photoinactivation.
AB  - We previously showed that covalent conjugates between poly-L-lysine and chlorin(e6) were efficient photosensitizers (PS) of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The polycationic molecular constructs increased binding and penetration of the PS into impermeable gram-negative cells. We have now prepared a novel set of second-generation polycationic conjugates between chlorin(e6) and three molecular forms of polyethyleneimine (PEI): a small linear, a small cross-linked, and a large cross-linked molecule. The conjugates were characterized by high-pressure liquid chromatography and tested for their ability to kill a panel of pathogenic microorganisms, the gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, the gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast Candida albicans, after exposure to low levels of red light. The large cross-linked molecule efficiently killed all organisms, while the linear conjugate killed gram-positive bacteria and C. albicans. The small cross-linked conjugate was the least efficient antimicrobial PS and its remarkably low activity could not be explained by reduced photochemical quantum yield or reduced cellular uptake. In contrast to polylysine conjugates, the PEI conjugates were resistant to degradation by proteases such as trypsin that hydrolyze lysine-lysine peptide bonds, The advantage of protease stability combined with the ready availability of PEI suggests these molecules may be superior to polylysine-PS conjugates for photodynamic therapy of localized infections.
TI  - Changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children 3 months-3 years old. OBJECTIVE: To describe the changing incidence and etiology of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. METHODS: Retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between September 1998 and August 2003 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. RESULTS: Implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. The rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. During the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. By 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. In our population of children routinely immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). CONCLUSION: In the United States, routine vaccinations with Haemophilus influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. As the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. The use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated. New guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.
TI  - [Lethal end of a group C streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis in a healthy female].
AB  - The necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life threatening, quickly progressive soft-tissue infection characterized by necrosis of the superficial fascia. It is very rare in the head and neck region. Usually this infection attacks weak patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or cancer. In adults the most common organisms implicated in craniocervical NF are Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans and Peptostreptococci. The typical infectious entrance is a deep wound, after surgery or a peritonsillar abscess. We describe a very unusual case of a craniocervical NF with a deadly outcome in a sixty year old female. The patient had no chronic diseases and went to an ENT doctor with an acute tonsillitis for 3 days. Within the next three hours the general condition became dangerous to life. Therefore she was brought to us for immediate therapy. But despite fast and aggressive surgery of the neck, throat and thorax the patient died of a toxic schock syndrome on the intensive care unit within a few hours. The microbiology showed just group C Streptococcus. The postmortem examination confirmed the NF with starting point in the left tonsil after acute tonsillitis. Such a foudroyant course of a craniocervical NF with group C streptococci in a healthy patient is not published yet.
TI  - [Parapneumonic pleural effusion: an 11-year review].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last few years, the incidence of parapneumonic effusions in  children with community-acquired pneumonia seems to have increased. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and incidence of parapneumonic effusions throughout an 11-year period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged < 15 years old with parapneumonic effusions from 1993 to 2003. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 children < 15 years old from Health Area 5 of Madrid and per 100 children hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department of our hospital. The linear association test was used to compare the incidence rates over the previous 11 years. RESULTS: There were 130 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusions. The mean age was 4.7 years. Forty-one percent received antibiotics before diagnosis. The causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (32.3%). The most effective diagnostic method was pleural-fluid culture (18/58, 31%). The most common organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Haemophilus influenzae (3) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2). Thirty-two percent of the patients required pleural drainage and 16% underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Of 12 S. pneumoniae antibiograms available, 91.7% showed full susceptibility to penicillin and 75% were susceptible to erythromycin. The annual incidence of parapneumonic effusions rose from 18.1 in 1993 to 42.9 in 2003 (p < 0.001) per 100,000 children and from 0.76 in 1993 to 3.3 in 2003 (p < 0.001) per 100 children hospitalized in our unit. CONCLUSION: The incidence of parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia showed a statistically significant increase between 1993 and 2003. The most common causal organism was S. pneumoniae, with a low rate of penicillin resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial evaluation of 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives.
AB  - We investigated the antibacterial activity of some new 2-aryl-3,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone derivatives, previously prepared from 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, to find effective antibacterial agents. The antibacterial activity was first tested in vitro by the disk diffusion assay against two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria, and then the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of active compounds was determined. The results showed that some 2-aryl-3,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone derivatives inhibit growth of both gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes), microorganisms that cause food poisoning and rheumatic fever. This study points out the antibacterial activity of some 2-aryl-3,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone derivatives.
TI  - Epithelial cells are sensitive detectors of bacterial pore-forming toxins.
AB  - Epithelial cells act as an interface between human mucosal surfaces and the surrounding environment. As a result, they are responsible for the initiation of local immune responses, which may be crucial for prevention of invasive infection. Here we show that epithelial cells detect the presence of bacterial pore-forming toxins (including pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, and anthrolysin O from Bacillus anthracis) at nanomolar concentrations, far below those required to cause cytolysis. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK appears to be a conserved response of epithelial cells to subcytolytic concentrations of bacterial poreforming toxins, and this activity is inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight osmolytes to the extracellular medium. By sensing osmotic stress caused by the insertion of a sublethal number of pores into their membranes, epithelial cells may act as an early warning system to commence an immune response, while the local density of toxin-producing bacteria remains low. Osmosensing may thus represent a novel innate immune response to a common bacterial virulence strategy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel C12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  - A novel series of C12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. The C12 modification involves replacing the natural C12 methyl group in the erythromycin core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. From the C12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of C12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. Several compounds were found to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. The C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of C12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. These pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Peptidoglycan and peptidoglycan-specific Th1 cells in psoriatic skin lesions.
AB  - We have previously demonstrated, in psoriatic skin lesions, the presence of a subset of dermal CD4+ T cells that produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to a mixture of cell wall proteins extracted from group A streptococci. However, the identity of the antigen(s) involved is unknown. To investigate the hypothesis that peptidoglycan (PG), the major constituent of the streptococcal cell wall, acts as a T cell activator in psoriasis, we performed in situ analysis to detect antigen-presenting cells containing PG in lesional versus non-lesional skin, and determined proliferation and IFN-gamma responses of lesional skin T cells. Increased numbers of PG-containing cells were detected in the dermal papillae and cellular infiltrates of guttate and chronic plaque skin lesions compared with normal and non-lesional psoriatic skin. A varying proportion of these were CD68+ macrophages, but the remaining cells did not double stain for either Langerhans' or dendritic cell markers. Psoriatic dermal streptococcal-specific CD4+ T cell lines proliferated and produced IFN-gamma in a self HLA-DR allele-restricted manner in response to streptococcal PG, excluding mitogenic or superantigenic stimulation, but were unresponsive to staphylococcal PG. Similarly, psoriatic staphylococcus-specific T cell lines recognized staphylococcal, but not streptococcal, PG by IFN-gamma production. The presence of PG-containing macrophages in close association with PG-specific CD4+ T cells in lesional skin suggests that PG may be responsible, at least in part, for T cell activation in psoriasis.
TI  - Development of serum IgM antibodies against superantigens of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in Kawasaki disease.
AB  - To serologically determine the association of microbial superantigens and the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD), we conducted a case-control study. Serum IgG and IgM antibodies against staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), SEB, SEC, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 293 serum samples from 65 KD patients on clinical days 1-28 and 120 control samples. The administration of immunoglobulin products, which contain high concentrations of IgG antibodies against all the superantigens, directly elevated antitoxin IgG antibodies in KD patients. In contrast, antitoxin IgM antibodies were not detected in immunoglobulin products. Actually, we found a significant elevation of IgM antibodies against SEA in KD patients in the first (median titre: 0.020, P < 0.01 versus control), second (0.024, P < 0.001), third (0.030, P < 0.001) and fourth (0.038, P < 0.001) weeks, compared to the controls (0.015). Significant differences of IgM antibodies were also true for SEB, TSST-1, and SPEA throughout the first to fourth weeks, and for SEC throughout the second to fourth weeks. The prevalence of KD patients having high IgM titres (> mean + 2SD of control values) to the 5 superantigens was increased with the clinical weeks, and reached 29-43% of KD subjects at the fourth week. This is the first study that describes kinetics of IgM antibodies against superantigens and clarifies the serological significance throughout the clinical course of KD. Our results suggest that multiple superantigens involve in the pathogenesis of KD.
TI  - [Paravertebral streptococcal myositis complicated by an epidural abscess in a 5-year-old girl].
AB  - CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old girl was hospitalised for fever, abdominal and lumbar pain, associated with general impairment state and a whitlow. One of the blood cultures and CSF grew A beta haemolytic Streptococcus, muscular echography and MRI showed paravertebral myositis, which was complicated by an epidural abscess. The outcome was good with medical treatment alone. DISCUSSION: Streptococcal myositis is a rare and severe skeletal muscle infection caused by A beta haemolytic Streptococcus. It is characterized by a muscle necrosis, without abscess formation. It has to be distinguished from pyomyositis, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, where a muscle abscess occurs, which must be treated by surgical drainage and antibiotics. Prognosis of this infection is poorer than other muscle infections such as pyomyositis, with a high mortality rate. The diagnosis is difficult and often delayed. Practitioners should keep in mind this diagnosis, even if symptoms are non specific, in front of an undetermined infectious syndrome associated with pain, and make an echography or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract on pathogenic bacteria  isolated from specimens of patients with respiratory tract disorders.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Eucalyptus globulus leaf extract was determined for 56 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 25 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 12 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and seven isolates of Haemophilus influenzae obtained from 200 clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract disorders. MIC50s for these species were 64, 32, 16 and 16 mg/L, respectively; MIC90s were 128, 64, 32 and 32 mg/L, respectively; and MBCs were 512, 128, 64 and 64 mg/L, respectively. These results suggest that further studies to clarify the possible therapeutic role of E. globulus leaf extract in the treatment of respiratory tract infection are warranted.
TI  - Integrin-linked kinase is an essential link between integrins and uptake of bacterial pathogens by epithelial cells.
AB  - Entry of Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus (GAS) into host cells is mediated by fibronectin bound to surface proteins, M1 or PrtF1, forming a bridge to alpha5beta1 integrins. This interaction leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and uptake of streptococci. We postulated that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which directly associates with integrins, is the universal link between integrins and several bacterial pathogens. We showed that inhibition of ILK expression by siRNA silencing, or ILK kinase activity by chemical inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative form of ILK reduced M1-mediated invasion of epithelial cells up to 80%. To evaluate the ILK requirement for PrtF1-mediated GAS invasion, a M1-PrtF1+ recombinant strain within the M1 background was constructed. Inhibition of ILK kinase activity also significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by this recombinant and wild-type strain JRS4 that expresses PrtF1. In addition, impaired ILK kinase activity results in significant reduction of integrin-dependent invasion mediated by invasins of two other important pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia spp. This study suggests that bacterial pathogens evolved different molecules and strategies to exploit the host integrin signalling pathway for their survival.
TI  - Single- and multistep resistance selection studies on the activity of retapamulin compared to other agents against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Retapamulin had the lowest rate of spontaneous mutations by single-step passaging and the lowest parent and selected mutant MICs by multistep passaging among all drugs tested for all Staphylococcus aureus strains and three Streptococcus pyogenes strains which yielded resistant clones. Retapamulin has a low potential for resistance selection in S. pyogenes, with a slow and gradual propensity for resistance development in S. aureus.
TI  - Intranasal exposure to bacterial superantigens induces airway inflammation in HLA class II transgenic mice.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is widely prevalent in the nasopharynges of healthy individuals (carriers) but can also cause serious infections. S. aureus can elaborate a variety of superantigen exotoxins in "carrier" or "pathogenic" states. Streptococcus pyogenes can also colonize the nasopharynx and elaborate superantigens. Unlike the acute effects of superantigen exotoxins absorbed through the gut or vaginal mucosa, little is known regarding the pathogenesis of superantigens entering through the intranasal route. In the current study, we evaluated the local and systemic effects of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) delivered through the intranasal route. Superantigens were administered intranasally on multiple occasions, and experimental animals were sacrificed on day 8 for experimental analyses. SEB-induced airway inflammation was more pronounced for HLA-DR3 transgenic mice than for BALB/c mice, consistent with bacterial superantigens binding more efficiently to human than murine major histocompatibility complex class II. The nature of the airway inflammation in HLA-DR3 mice was determined by the concentration of SEB applied intranasally. Low concentrations (20 ng) induced eosinophilic airway inflammation as well as eosinophil degranulation, whereas intranasal exposure to higher concentrations (2,000 ng) resulted in neutrophilic airway inflammation, permanent airway destruction, toxic shock, and mortality. SEB-induced eosinophilic inflammatory response was enhanced in signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-4-deficient HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice with defective interleukin-12 signaling. Intranasal administration of SPEA induced airway inflammation and systemic immune activation in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice. In conclusion, repeated chronic intranasal exposure to bacterial superantigens causes airway inflammation and systemic immune activation.
TI  - Changes in pharyngeal aerobic microflora in oral breathers after palatal rapid expansion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate in oral breathing children the qualitative and quantitative effects on aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oropharyngeal microflora of respiratory function improved by rapid palatal expansion (RPE). METHODS: In an open clinical trial, we studied 50 oral breathers, aged 8 to 14 years and suffering from both maxillary constriction and posterior cross-bite. At baseline, patients were examined by a single otorhinolaryngologist (ENT), confirming nasal obstruction in all subjects by posterior rhino-manometric test. Patients were evaluated three times by oropharyngeal swabs:1) at baseline (T = 0); 2) after palatal spreading out (T = 1); and 3) at the end of RPE treatment (T = 2). With regard to the microbiological aspect, the most common and potentially pathogenic oral microrganisms (i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus spp, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans) were specifically detected in proper culture plates, isolated colonies were identified by means of biochemical tests and counted by calibrated loop. The data were analyzed by means of the following tests: Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS: After the use of RME there was a statistically significant decrease of Staphylococcus aureus stock at CFU/mLat T1(P = 0.0005; Z = -3,455 by Wilcoxon Rank test) and T2 (P < 0.0001; Z = -4,512 by Wilcoxon Rank test) vs T0. No significant changes were found for the other examined microrganisms. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RPE therapy in oral breathers may strongly reduce the pathogenic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microflora in the oral pharynx after a normalization of the upper airways function, and may reduce the risk of respiratory infections.
TI  - [Community-acquired acute maxillary sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in adults in France: current management].
AB  - Sinus infections, often viral, are a common reason for physician visits. The multiplicity of clinical presentations makes its diagnosis difficult. The problem is to recognize bacterial infection without additional testing, except in cases of treatment failures, complications or relapse. Patients with signs suggestive of rhinosinusitis fall into one of four basic clinical situations: common colds, 'doubtful' rhinosinusitis, apparent acute maxillary bacterial rhinosinusitis, and complications. Anterior rhinoscopy may help confirm diagnosis. Current bacterial epidemiology is based on the results of clinical studies, microbial ecology, and samples taken in cases of treatment failure. The two bacteria isolated most frequently are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, both of which pose resistance problems. Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are isolated less often. The dominant issue in management of acute rhinosinusitis is whether to use antibiotic or symptomatic treatment. For viral infections, antibiotic therapy is useless and highly inadvisable. For 'doubtful' infections, symptomatic treatment is likely to lead to recovery. The use of non-recommended antibiotics also increases the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. When bacterial rhinosinusitis is strongly suspected, recourse to antibiotic treatment is recommended in view of the benefits in this situation (AFSSAPS 2005). This treatment is probabilistic, should be decided at the end of the consultation, and follows the AFSSAPS guidelines.
TI  - Novel 4-N-substituted aryl pent-2-ene-1,4-dione derivatives of piperazinyloxazolidinones as antibacterials.
AB  - A few substituted piperazinylphenyloxazolidinone compounds 6-13 having substitution on the distant nitrogen atom of piperazine ring scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. A few compounds showed superior in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes than linezolid and eperezolid.
TI  - Purification and characterization of LPXTGase from Staphylococcus aureus: the amino acid composition mirrors that found in the peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacterial surface proteins are important molecules in the infectivity and survival of pathogens. Surface proteins on gram-positive bacteria have been shown to attach via a transpeptidase, termed sortase, that cleaves an LPXTG sequence found close to the C termini of nearly all surface proteins on these bacteria. We previously identified a unique enzyme (LPXTGase) from Streptococcus pyogenes that also cleaves the LPXTG motif with a catalytic activity higher than that of sortase, suggesting that it plays an important role in the attachment process. We have now purified and characterized an LPXTGase from Staphylococcus aureus and found that it has both similar and unique features compared to the S. pyogenes enzyme. The S. aureus enzyme is glycosylated and contains unusual amino acids, like its streptococcal counterpart. Like the streptococcal enzyme, staphylococcal LPXTGase has an overrepresentation of amino acids found in the peptidoglycan, i.e., glutamine/glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and lysine, and furthermore, we find that these amino acids are present in the enzyme at precisely the same ratio at which they are found in the peptidoglycan for the respective organism. This suggests that enzymes responsible for wall assembly may also play a role in the construction of LPXTGase.
TI  - Flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  - Propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. Since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the Croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. Antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12204, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and one yeast-like fungus Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were compared. Results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. Total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most products had the flavonoids content below 9%. All products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four Gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against P. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus C. albicans. Total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. Our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.
TI  - Causative microorganisms in surgically treated pediatric hand infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The causative organisms in many pediatric musculoskeletal infections are distinct from their adult counterparts. We investigated the organisms found in surgically treated hand infections in the pediatric population. METHODS: We reviewed the hospital charts and computer records of all patients who had surgical intervention for infections of the forearm, wrist, and hand from 1996 through 2002 at The Children's Hospital of Boston. RESULTS: Thirty-eight surgical procedures were performed on 31 children for 32 different upper-extremity infections. One patient was treated for 2 separate infections. In the 32 primary procedures 7 cultures grew mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms, 19 grew aerobic organisms only, 6 grew no organisms, and 2 patients had no cultures. One culture from a secondary surgery was positive for Candida parapsilosis. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 15 of the primary cases and was the primary organism in 12. Five of 7 mixed infections were associated with paronychia; 2 of the paronychial infections were complicated by flexor tenosynovitis. Chronic nail biting caused 2 infections and 1 was associated with thumb sucking. CONCLUSIONS: In the adult population S aureus is the primary organism cultured in 50% to 80% of cases and anaerobic or mixed infection may occur in upward of 29% of patients. In this series S aureus was the primary organism in only 37%. Group A Streptococcus pyogenes was present in 20% of cases. The percentage of children with a mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection was similar to that found in adults; however, the presumed route of introduction was digital sucking/biting. Based on the number of anaerobic/mixed infections without predisposing factors we recommend a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including anaerobic coverage as the initial antibiotic in the setting of pediatric hand infections.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - The antimicrobial potential of honey from United Arab Emirates on some microbial  isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study investigated activity of honey towards pathogens when grown in media contained honey, or when honey was added to cultures after inoculation. MATERIAL/METHODS: 1--Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), E.coli and Candida albicans (C. albicans) were cultured into broth containing 10-100% (wt/v) honey concentrations. 2--Honey was added to broth inoculated with isolates after inoculation. 3--Optimum growth of isolates, therapeutic period of honey, and time after addition of honey that showed optimum effect was measured. RESULTS: The optimum growth of E. Coli and C. Albicans was 10 hrs and S. aureus was 12 hrs. Honey (30-70%) prevents growth of all isolates. Honey (80%) inhibited growth of small (1 microl) and large size of inoculum (10 microl) of E. Coli and S. Aureus when added to their cultures during 24 hrs after inoculation. Honey inhibited growth of C. Albicans when added during 2 to 6 hrs after inoculation. Honey delayed the appearance of microbial growth on the plates. Reculturing of specimens collected from media that showed no growth after addition of honey yielded recovery growth for E.coli and C. Albicans, and therapeutic period of honey for E.coli and S. Aureus was 2-24 hrs and for C. Albicans was 2-6 hrs. CONCLUSIONS: Honey prevents growth of the isolates and inhibits their growth when honey was added to growing culture. The therapeutic period of honey and recovery growth of inhibited isolates necessitates adjustment of honey doses according to type of isolate and grade of growth.
TI  - Bullous erysipelas: clinical presentation, staphylococcal involvement and methicillin resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis, mostly of streptococcal origin. Bullous erysipelas represents a severe form of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics and treatment of bullous erysipelas. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of bullous erysipelas who were treated at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between the years 1996 and 2001 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (11 women, 3 men) with bullous erysipelas were evaluated. The lesions were located on the legs and face in 9 and 4 patients, respectively. The median duration of disease before hospital admission was 4 days. Eight patients had fever at presentation. Local trauma and various lesions were common causes for pathogen entry. The initial empirical antibiotic treatment included intravenous beta-lactams and was modified according to the sensitivities of the isolated strains. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 (50%), while S. warneri, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli grew from the lesions of 3 other patients. Six out of 7 S. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (MRSA) but susceptible to several other non-beta-lactam antibiotics such as quinolones, vancomycin, rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that S. aureus is frequently involved in and probably contributes in synergy with beta-hemolytic streptococci to the complicated course of bullous erysipelas. The frequency of MRSA isolation suggests that beta-lactam antibiotics may not be sufficient for the treatment of bullous erysipelas anymore, at least in areas with a high incidence of MRSA strains. The role of other classes of antibiotics providing adequate coverage for MRSA has to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - Community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus: an emerging problem in the athletic population.
AB  - Participants of contact sports are at risk for outbreaks of skin and soft tissue  infection. Causes of reported outbreaks include Staphylococcus aureus, herpes simplex virus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and several fungi. Although once thought of solely as a nosocomial pathogen, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been identified as an emerging problem in the community, particularly in the athletic population. Despite a recent increase in reported outbreaks of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus soft tissue infection in athletic teams, many sports medicine physicians are unfamiliar with the epidemiology of this pathogen. It is spread via person-to-person contact and is harbored within the anterior nares and on the skin of carriers. Outbreaks of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus soft tissue infection are not treated by traditional beta-lactam antibiotics, and they can be difficult to eradicate. Such infections have been associated with significant morbidity, with up to 70% of involved team members requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. A thorough understanding of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is essential for the sports medicine physician to properly identify, treat, and control infectious outbreaks.
TI  - Treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin infections in the pediatric and adolescent patient populations.
AB  - Before 1980, superficial pyodermas in the US were caused primarily by streptococci. Studies conducted in Miami show that during the early 1980s, the predominant pathogen associated with impetigo in pediatric patients shifted from Streptococcus pyogenes to Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequent reports revealed a trend of increasing resistance of S. aureus to penicillins. By regular monitoring of local sensitivity patterns physicians are more likely to select the appropriate antibiotic. The current recommendation for the treatment of pediatric skin disease is cephalosporins due to their low likelihood of resistance by S. aureus.
TI  - Update on treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Dermatologists treat a variety of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) such as folliculitis, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, furuncles, carbuncles, and non-perirectal abscesses. Most uSSSIs are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The new extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime) offer efficacy against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Despite recently published guidelines, many physicians do not prescribe cephalosporins for uSSSIs out of concern that these agents will produce a hypersensitivity reaction in patients allergic to penicillin. Although the rate of cephalosporin reaction in penicillin-allergic patients is often quoted as up to 10%, this rate does not take into account the 1% to 3% risk for allergy to cephalosporin alone and the nonspecific increased risk of penicillin-allergic patients to develop hypersensitivity to other drugs. When these additional risks are considered, the likelihood of a reaction in known penicillin-allergic patients, especially to most third-generation and extended spectrum cephalosporins, becomes less than 1%. Cephalosporins with side chains unlike those of penicillin or ampicillin side chains are less likely to result in an allergic reaction in penicillin or ampicillin-allergic patients than cephalosporins with similar side chains. Although both cefdinir and cefpodoxime are considered to carry a very low risk of cross reactivity with penicillin or ampicillin, the former demonstrates better activity against S. aureus. Among the late-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir is the most potent oral agent when tested against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, 4- to 16-fold more active than cefprozil and cephalexin, respectively.
TI  - Vitellogenin is a novel player in defense reactions.
AB  - The significance of the presence of vitellogenin (Vg), a female-specific protein, in male and juvenile fish is uncertain. Here we show that the Vg purified from the rosy barb Puntius conchonius possesses both antibacterial and hemagglutinating activities in vitro, and the male fish challenged with Escherichia coli synthesize Vg. These suggest that in addition to being involved in yolk protein formation, Vg is also involved in defense reactions, a novel function assigned to Vg.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (Catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. DESIGN: Lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. The agar dilution method of the NCCLS was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of 20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. Slight growth was defined as marked growth reduction (MGR). The E-test was used to determine the MICs of tetracycline and penicillin-G for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-MIC of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). RESULTS: Eighteen strains (55%) were sensitive to the extracts (MICs 5-20 mg/ml). Most of these were periodontal pathogens with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (MIC 5-10mg/ml). Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. Except for Lactobacillus acidophilus that showed MGR at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. The extracts were active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 10-20 mg/ml) but not against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of the khat extracts at a sub-MIC resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. There is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. Further investigation is needed to identify the active components and assess their clinical relevance.
TI  - Compositions and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils of two Hypericum  species from Turkey.
AB  - The chemical compositions of essential oils obtained from Hypericum hyssopifolium var. microcalycinum and Hypericum lysimachioides var. lysimachioides were analysed by using GC and GC-MS. Caryophyllene oxide was found to be the major component. The essential oils of both Hypericum species showed antimicrobial activity against nine microorganism at a concentration of 60 to 80 microg/ml.
TI  - The impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  - The imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. We explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. This model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. Historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the Index of Association I(A). We show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. It is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of I(A). We therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. We also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.
TI  - Infectious complications of traditional Samoan tattooing.
AB  
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp.HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC(50) of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was approximately 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin-inflammation and acne.
TI  - Eradication of pathogens from the nasopharynx after therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis with low- or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - The growing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin can be overcome  by increasing the dose of the penicillin administered. This generated the recommendation that the adult dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) be increased from 1.5 g/day to 4.0 g/day. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the higher dose of amoxicillin is more effective than the previously recommended dose in eradicating S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx of patients who present with AMS. Nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 58 patients with AMS were studied: 30 received amoxicillin 1.5 g/day given in divided doses three times a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 4:1 formulation) and 28 were treated with amoxicillin 4.0 g/day given in divided doses twice a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 16:1 formulation). Seventy-one potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated: S. pneumoniae (27 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (25), Moraxella catarrhalis (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (9). The number of S. pneumoniae isolates in the 1.5 g/day group was reduced from 14 to 9 (2 intermediately resistant and 3 highly resistant). In contrast, the number of S. pneumoniae isolates in the 4.0 g/day group was reduced from 13 to 2 (1 highly resistant) (P<0.05). No differences were noted in the eradication rate of other groups of isolates, which were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These data illustrate the superiority of 4.0 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared with 1.5 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the eradication of S. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.
TI  - Current options for the treatment of impetigo in children.
AB  - Impetigo contagiosa is a common, superficial, bacterial infection of the skin characterised by an inflamed and infected epidermis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or both. The less common bullous impetigo is characterised by fragile fluid-filled vesicles and flaccid blisters, and is invariably caused by pathogenic strains of S. aureus. In bullous impetigo, exfoliative toxins are produced, although these are restricted to the area of infection and bacteria can be cultured from the blister contents. In the rare variant, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, the exfoliative toxins are spread haematogenously from a localised source causing widespread epidermal damage at distant sites.
TI  - [Resistance of mastitis pathogens in northern Germany].
AB  - The data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from April 2003 through March 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the Institute for Food Quality and Safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. Two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. One third of these were identified as Streptococcus (S.) uberis, one fourth as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. All isolates (100%) of S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, S. agalactiae and Arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Concering S. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to Oxacillin, Cephalothin, Cefacetril, Cefquinom and Neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to Penicillin, Ampicillin and Cefoperazon. The gram-negative rods (Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. More than 93% of all examined isolates including Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to Colistin. The sensitivity of E. coli and Klebsiella spp.to Marbofloxacin, Enrofloxacin and Cefquinom exceeded 96%. Thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. Because the highly effective Colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Mode of action and biochemical characterization of REP8839, a novel inhibitor of  methionyl-tRNA synthetase.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have attracted interest as essential and novel targets involved in bacterial protein synthesis. REP8839 is a potent inhibitor of MetS, the methionyl-tRNA synthetase in Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and in Streptococcus pyogenes. The biochemical activity of REP8839 was shown by specific inhibition of purified S. aureus MetS (50% inhibitory concentration, <1.9 nM). Target specificity was confirmed by overexpression of the metS gene in S. aureus, resulting in an eightfold increase in the MIC for REP8839. Macromolecular synthesis assays in the presence of REP8839 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis in S. pneumoniae R6, but only protein synthesis was affected in an isogenic rel mutant deficient in the stringent response. Strains with reduced susceptibility to REP8839 were generated by selection of strains with spontaneous mutations and through serial passages. Point mutations within the metS gene were mapped, leading to a total of 23 different amino acid substitutions within MetS that were located around the modeled active site. The most frequent MetS mutations were I57N, leading to a shift in the MIC from 0.06 microg/ml to 4 microg/ml, and G54S, resulting in a MIC of 32 microg/ml that was associated with a reduced growth rate. The mutation prevention concentration was 32 microg/ml in four S. aureus strains (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA), which is well below the drug concentration of 2% (20,000 microg/ml) in a topical formulation. In conclusion, we demonstrate by biochemical, physiologic, and genetic mode-of-action studies that REP8839 exerts its antibacterial activity through specific inhibition of MetS, a novel target.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of REP8839, a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  - REP8839 is a novel methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetS) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. All isolates of S. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. REP8839 was also active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (MIC, < or =0.25 microg/ml). All S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that MetS2, a second enzyme previously identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present in this organism. REP8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by pH, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak acidic medium. Like mupirocin, REP8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against key pathogens. The emergence of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus highlights the need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Keratinocyte production of cathelicidin provides direct activity against bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  - Immune defense at an interface with the external environment reflects the functions of physical and chemical barriers provided by epithelial and immune cells. Resident epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes, produce numerous peptides with direct antimicrobial activity but also provide a physical barrier against invading pathogens and signal the recruitment of circulating immune cells, such as neutrophils. Antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin are produced constitutively by neutrophils and are inducible in keratinocytes in response to infection. The multiplicity of antimicrobial peptides and their cellular sources has resulted in an incomplete understanding of the role of cathelicidin production by epithelial cells in cutaneous immune defense. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate keratinocyte antimicrobial activity and the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to host protection against two leading human skin pathogens. Wild-type mice and those with a targeted deletion of the cathelicidin gene, Cnlp, were rendered neutropenic prior to cutaneous infection. Interestingly, Cnlp-deficient mice remained more susceptible to group A streptococcus infection than mice with Cnlp intact, suggesting the involvement of epithelial cell-derived cathelicidin in host immune defense. Keratinocytes were then isolated in culture and found to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, an effect that was partially dependent on their ability to synthesize and activate cathelicidin. Further, lentivirus-mediated delivery of activated human cathelicidin enhanced keratinocyte antimicrobial activity. Combined, these data illustrate the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to the innate immune defense of skin against bacterial pathogens and highlight the need to consider epithelial antimicrobial function in the diagnosis and therapy of skin infection.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Cloning, characterization and expression of escapin, a broadly antimicrobial FAD-containing L-amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare Aplysia californica.
AB  - A 60 kDa monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare Aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced, and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in E. coli. Sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. This protein, which we call ;escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. Escapin was verified by NMR, mass spectroscopy and HPLC to have FAD as its flavin cofactor. Escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. Native escapin inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (Vibrio harveyii and Staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. Escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. Escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 micromol l(-1), but was bactericidal in media enriched with Tryptone Peptone. Escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l(-1) and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l(-1) l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l(-1). Escapin had high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. Hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. Together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's LAAO activity, but bactericidal effects resulting from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. Recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of larval secretions of the blowfly, Lucilia sericata.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of secretions aseptically collected from larvae of the greenbottle fly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were examined. These investigations revealed the presence of small (<1 kDa) antibacterial factor(s) within the larval secretions, active against a range of bacteria. These include the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and to a lesser extent the Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These secretions were shown to be highly stable as a freeze-dried preparation and, considering the activity against organisms typically associated with clinical infection, may be a source of novel antibiotic-like compounds that may be used for infection control and in the fight against MRSA.
TI  - Standardization of a rapid immunochromatographic test with the recombinant antigens K39 and K26 for the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis.
AB  - The serological diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) remains problematic because there areno reliable commercially available tests. Most laboratories use domestically prepared tests such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). We evaluated rapid immunochromatographic (RICH) test kits for the diagnosis of CVL. The tests were assembled with either Leishmania chagasi recombinant antigens K39 or K26 and with either gold-labelled Staphylococcus aureus protein A or Streptococcus pyogenes protein G. Fifty sera from dogs with CVL, 14 sera from dogs with Chagas disease, and 50 sera from normal healthy dogs were tested. The results show that the RICH test using recombinant antigen K39 has a sensitivity of 96% and 100% specificity for the diagnosis of CVL. No significant differences were observed in the tests assembled with either protein A or protein G. The RICH tests using recombinant antigen K26 were equally specific but less sensitive than those using K39. However, the 2 antigens complemented each other and increased the overall sensitivity of the test. Because of its simplicity and performance the RICH test is a quick and reliable alternative for the diagnosis of CVL either in conventional laboratories or for remote areas where laboratories are not readily accessible for conventional assays.
TI  - Effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on herd life in two New York State  dairy herds.
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (CM) (both with and without specific pathogen identification) occurring in different stages of lactation on length of herd life in two New York State dairy farms. The 2,697 cows in the study were followed for one lactation (the first-occurring one on or after 1 October 1999), until it ended because of a new lactation, culling, or end of study (31 March 2001 in one farm; 31 July 2001 in the other). A Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates, in SAS((R)), was used to measure, within a lactation, the effect of the first occurrence of CM (without specific pathogen identification) occurring 1--7, 8--66, 67--100, 101--225, or >or=226 days in milk (DIM), on how long cows remained in the herd. For the first occurrence of CM due to Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and 'no pathogen isolated', the intervals were before and after the median DIM of first occurrence of each pathogen. There were too few cases due to Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and 'other pathogens grouped together' to split into intervals, so they were modeled as binary variables, i.e. as they occurred. CM was modeled using time-dependent covariates, to account for its differing effects throughout lactation on culling. Other variables controlled for were herd, parity, calving season, and other significant diseases. In the dataset, the lactational incidence risk of the first occurrence of CM was 18.2%; 20.0% of the cows did not survive the lactation that was studied. The overall annual culling percentage for both herds during the study period (including all cows, whether eligible for the study or not) was 35.6%. For cows with CM without pathogen identification, their highest hazard ratio (HR) of culling occurred from 67 to 100 DIM. All of the pathogens modeled markedly reduced herd life. On average over the entire lactation, cows with Staphylococcus spp. CM had the highest HRs for culling, although there were no significant differences among pathogens (at p=0.0018 (reflecting 28 pairwise comparisons)). For early-occurring (before median DIM of first occurrence) S. aureus CM, the daily rate of change of the HR of culling increased over time. The HRs for culling were particularly high for late-occurring (after median DIM of first occurrence) E. coli and Klebsiella spp. CM early in the interval, but the daily rate of change of the hazard of culling for these two pathogens decreased sharply over time. Treating CM as time-dependent therefore allowed us to measure in greater detail, its varying effects (of when it occurred) on herd life.
TI  - Growth and survival of bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome on cot mattress materials.
AB  - AIMS: To compare growth and survival of selected bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) on cot mattress polyurethane (PU) inner-foams and on different types of cot mattress cover materials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes were inoculated onto swatches of new-unused cot mattress PU inner-foam and onto three types of cot mattress covers (polyvinyl chloride, cotton and polyester). The influence of inoculation cell density, relative humidity (RH) and temperature of incubation on survival was assessed by recovery of cells in 0.85% NaCl, with viable cell enumeration by plate counting on selective and differential media. Utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources within cot mattress PU was assessed by following growth on aqueous leachate from PU, and by colorimetric determination of aromatic amines. Good survival capability (>206 d) was shown by all three test species on PU inner-foam and on polyester mattress cover at high RH (75%), but only by Staph. aureus on PU at low RH (25%). Aqueous soluble material from PU foam supports bacterial growth; removal of aromatic amines from aqueous leachate from PU accompanies growth of Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus has good survival capability on cot mattress PU foam, even at low RH. Soluble material within PU can serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for bacterial growth. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Prolonged survival of Staph. aureus on PU at low RH could explain, in the context of the common bacterial toxins hypothesis, an increased risk of SIDS associated with used infant mattresses.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children.
AB  - AIM: To study the bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children and to analyse the efficiency of culture methods. METHODS: Bacteriological data of 407 cases of clinically suspected osteoarticular infections affecting 406 children hospitalized in an orthopaedic surgery department between 1999 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Bacterial cultures from clinical specimens were positive in 74 cases (18%): 38 cases of septic arthritis and 36 cases of bone infections (osteitis, osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis). The use of liquid medium bottles to grow bacteria from articular fluids increased the rate of positive cultures compared to the use of standard solid media (p = 0.0001). The most commonly recovered pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (44%) followed by Kingella kingae (14%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%). K. kingae was most frequently isolated among children under 36 mo of age (p = 0.0003), whereas S. aureus was most frequently isolated among children over 36 mo (p = 0.0015). CONCLUSION: By improving our culture method, we observed a recrudescence of isolation of K. kingae, but S. aureus remains the main pathogen isolated from osteoarticular infections in children. This finding is useful for the adaptation of a probabilistic antibiotic treatment of these infections.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pulmonary pathogens.
AB  - Among infectious diseases, pneumonia is still the ;;captain of the men of death.'' Etiologic diagnosis is often unreliable; consequently, clinicians must know epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy. In recent years, all major pulmonary pathogens have become more and more resistant to conventional antibiotics. Penicillin-resistant and even multiresistant pneumococci have spread worldwide, but primarily in the United States, some European countries, South Africa, and the Far East. A similar trend is evidenced by ampicillin-resistant Hemophilus influenzae, whereas Moraxella catarrhalis almost invariably produces beta-lactamases. The widening of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from hospitals to the community may be the new reality of the 1990s. Increasing erythromycin resistance of Streptococcus pyogenes requires beta-lactam therapy. The spread of both cromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases makes treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enterobacilli more difficult. Bacterial resistance creates a challenge for clinicians from the viewpoint of correct and successful management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Bulgaria--a synopsis from BulSTAR 2003.
AB  - We introduce Bulgarian Surveillance Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (BulSTAR) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. This longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. Twenty eight public, 45 hospital and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the Republic of Bulgaria participated in BulSTAR 2003. The total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. Seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in BulSTAR 2003: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus-Providencia-Morganella group, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Generally the resistance of clinically significant Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in Bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. A unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. This is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. The forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase the sensitivity and the significance of BulSTAR surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Establishment of a superficial skin infection model in mice by using Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A new animal model for the purpose of studying superficial infections is presented. In this model an infection is established by disruption of the skin barrier by partial removal of the epidermal layer by tape stripping and subsequent application of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection and the infection route are purely topical, in contrast to those used in previously described animal models in mice, such as the skin suture-wound model, where the infection is introduced into the deeper layers of the skin. Thus, the present model is considered more biologically relevant for the study of superficial skin infections in mice and humans. Established topical antibiotic treatments are shown to be effective. The procedures involved in the model are simple, a feature that increases throughput and reproducibility. This new model should be applicable to the evaluation of novel antimicrobial treatments of superficial infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Bacterial skin infections among patients with hemoglobinopathies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hemoglobinopathies are a common problem in our locality, yet there were no previous studies concerning skin lesions among those patients. We sought to find out the most common skin lesions among patients with hemoglobinopathies and the frequency of occurrence of bacterial skin infections in those patients. METHODS: A total of 168 patients with bacterial skin infections were included in this study. The specimens were collected from outpatients dermatology departments of 5 main hospitals in different areas in Basrah governorate, Iraq (hospital-based study) from March 2002 to October 2002. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of hemoglobin on electrophoresis. The first group included 35 patients with bacterial skin infections and hemoglobinopathies while the second one included 133 patients with normal hemoglobin. RESULTS: Recurrent bacterial skin infections was reported in 30 out of 35 patients with hemoglobinopathies (85.7%) and 45 out of 133 in those with normal hemoglobin (33.8%). In addition, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were isolated from patients with hemoglobinopathies (74.3%) and gram negative bacteria (42.9%). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that patients with hemoglobinopathies were more susceptible to recurrent bacterial skin infections than those with normal hemoglobin. In addition, S. aureus and gram negative bacteria were isolated more commonly from patients with hemoglobinopathies.
TI  - [Hospitalizations for varicella in the Hospital Infantil La Fe, Valencia,Spain, 2001-2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Varicella is a common, highly contagious disease. It is usually benign but has potentially serious complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To assess the clinical characteristics and the associated cost of varicella hospitalization, we reviewed the medical records of children hospitalized for varicella between 2001 and 2004. Children with coincidental varicella hospitalized for a different reason were excluded. RESULTS: Of 1177 children with varicella attended at the emergency room, 101 (8.6 %) were hospitalized. The median age was 3.2 years (21 days to 18.9 years). Twenty-eight children had underlying disease. Thirty-seven children had no complications and the reason for admission was: a) risk of severe varicella (21 immunocompromised children, three neonates), and b) high fever or observation (13 cases). The 64 remaining children were admitted for 66 complications of varicella. The most common complications were skin/soft tissue infections (33 patients) and the leading cause was Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10) isolated in blood or the site of infection. Other complications were pneumonia (13 children), neurological (febrile seizures in nine, meningoencephalitis in two, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in one, cerebellitis in one), hematological (neutropenia in one, Henoch-Schonlein purpura in one and thrombopenic purpura in three) and osteoarticular (synovitis in one and septic arthritis in one). One patient died of multiorgan failure. During the study period, the rate of emergency room visits due to varicella doubled and the number of admissions for complications tripled. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.8 days (range: 1-28 days) and the total associated cost was 397,314.14 Euro, excluding symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The high morbidity associated with varicella and its complications, as well as the high social costs of this disease, support the implementation of routine varicella vaccination. This could reduce the total number of cases, their severity, direct costs, generated by medical care, and indirect costs, generated by the disease and hospitalization.
TI  - A toll-like receptor 2-responsive lipid effector pathway protects mammals against skin infections with gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - flake (flk), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced recessive germ line mutation of C57BL/6 mice, impairs the clearance of skin infections by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, gram-positive pathogens that elicit innate immune responses by activating Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Positional cloning and sequencing revealed that flk is a novel allele of the stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 gene (Scd1). flake homozygotes show reduced sebum production and are unable to synthesize the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) palmitoleate (C(16:1)) and oleate (C(18:1)), both of which are bactericidal against gram-positive (but not gram-negative) organisms in vitro. However, intradermal MUFA administration to S. aureus-infected mice partially rescues the flake phenotype, which indicates that an additional component of the sebum may be required to improve bacterial clearance. In normal mice, transcription of Scd1-a gene with numerous NF-kappaB elements in its promoter--is strongly and specifically induced by TLR2 signaling. Similarly, the SCD1 gene is induced by TLR2 signaling in a human sebocyte cell line. These observations reveal the existence of a regulated, lipid-based antimicrobial effector pathway in mammals and suggest new approaches to the treatment or prevention of infections with gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers: novel sequence-selective, DNA-interactive, cross-linking agents with activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand DNA minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. We investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, SJG-136, DRG-16 and ELB-21, which differ in the structure of the PBD monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical PBD monomers. METHODS: MICs were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 12 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of Streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of Listeria monocytogenes and 24 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Binding to double-stranded DNA was assessed by determination of the DNA melting temperature (T(m)). RESULTS: MIC(90) values for SJG-136 were 0.5 mg/L against MRSA, VRE and L. monocytogenes, 0.06 mg/L against S. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/L against S. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. MIC(90)s for DRG-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/L, respectively. The most potent compound was ELB-21, with corresponding MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/L. There was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. All Gram-negative species (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. PBD dimers showed bactericidal activity against MRSA and VRE and there was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). Incubation of EMRSA-16 genomic DNA (50 microM) with 20 microM ELB-21 resulted in a large increase in T(m) suggesting that PBD dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two DNA strands. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein D expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.
AB  - Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. In vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. The aim of the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine SP-D (pSP-D) in the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. Furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among pSP-D, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. Lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by Staph. aureus or Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. By comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse pSP-D immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of pSP-D was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. Co-localization of pSP-D, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and pSP-D showed a patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. SP-D immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. The dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. Increased expression of pSP-D in the surfactant coincided with presence of pSP-D-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), indicating a possible transport of pSP-D through the specialized M cells overlying (BALT). In conclusion, we have shown that pSP-D expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and with dendritic cells in microbial-induced BALT. The function of the interaction between pSP-D and dendritic cells in BALT remain unclear, but pSP-D could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in BALT.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus golden pigment impairs neutrophil killing and promotes virulence through its antioxidant activity.
AB  - Golden color imparted by carotenoid pigments is the eponymous feature of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Here we demonstrate a role of this hallmark phenotype in virulence. Compared with the wild-type (WT) bacterium, a S. aureus mutant with disrupted carotenoid biosynthesis is more susceptible to oxidant killing, has impaired neutrophil survival, and is less pathogenic in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. The survival advantage of WT S. aureus over the carotenoid-deficient mutant is lost upon inhibition of neutrophil oxidative burst or in human or murine nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-deficient hosts. Conversely, heterologous expression of the S. aureus carotenoid in the nonpigmented Streptococcus pyogenes confers enhanced oxidant and neutrophil resistance and increased animal virulence. Blocking S. aureus carotenogenesis increases oxidant sensitivity and decreases whole-blood survival, suggesting a novel target for antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Surgical therapy for hand infections Part 2].
AB  - Due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. Most of these infections are post-traumatic. Isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly Staphylococcus aureus and ss-haemolytic group A streptococci. But differential diagnosis also includes pyoderma gangrenosum, tumors of the hand, rheumatoid arthritis, and articular gout, as they may mimic hand infections. Infections of the hand can lead to massive tissue damage that needs to be reconstructed. The selection of methods depends on the localization and size of defects and includes primary closure, split- and full-thickness skin grafts, and more complex operations such as local, regional, and distant flaps.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro activity of telithromycin against community acquired respiratory pathogens].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial, that can be useful for the treatment of respiratory infections. AIM: To compare in vitro activity of telithromycin against respiratory pathogens, isolated in outpatient clinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty strains isolated from patients with respiratory infections, were studied. The strains studied were S pneumoniae, penicillin sensitive (SPNS:57); intermediate (SPNI:35), resistant (SPNR:25); S pyogenes (SP:57); H influenzae (HIN 51); M catarrhalis (MC:25) and S aureus meticillin sensitive (SAUS:30). Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by broth microdilution was studied for telitrhomycin and levofloxacin in all strains. Other antimicrobials studied, but not in all strains were erythromycin, clindamycin, trimetoprim sulphamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime. RESULTS: All strains were sensible to telithromycin at a concentration -4 microg/ml. MIC 90 and its range for SPNS was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-0.12), for SPNI was 0.03 microg/ml (-0.004-025), for SPNR was 0.06 microg/ml (-0.004-0.25), for HIN was 2 microg/ml (0.12-4), for SP was 0.5 microg/ml (-0.004-2), for MC was 0.5 microg/ml (0.06-2) and for SAU was 0.25 microg/ml (0.06-0.25). CONCLUSIONS: All studied pathogens were sensible to telithromycin in vitro. This antimicrobial is an alternative for the treatment of community acquired respiratory infections.
TI  - Dissemination of the superantigen encoding genes seeL, seeM, szeL and szeM in Streptococcus equi subsp. equi and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens are one of the major virulence factors produced by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two novel superantigen encoding genes seeM and seeL were described for S. equi subsp. equi which is known as the causative agent of strangles in equids. In the present study previously characterized S. equi subsp. equi strains and strains of various other animal pathogenic streptococcal species and subspecies were investigated for the presence of the superantigen encoding genes seeM and seeL by polymerase chain reaction. According to these studies seeL and seeM appeared to be a constant characteristic of all investigated S. equi subsp. equi strains. Surprisingly, one S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain (S.z. 122) was also positive for both genes. The species identity of this S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain could additionally be confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region. The superantigen encoding genes could not be found among additionally investigated S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains or among strains of seven other streptococcal species. The seeL and seeM genes of the S. equi subsp. equi strain S.e. CF32 and the genes szeL and szeM of the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain S.z. 122 were cloned and sequenced. A sequence comparison revealed a high degree of sequence homology between seeL, szeL, speL and seeM, szeM and speM, respectively. The superantigenic toxins L and M seemed to be widely distributed virulence factors of S. equi subsp. equi, rare among S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus but did not occur among a number of other animal pathogenic streptococcal species.
TI  - Recognizing the pseudogenes in bacterial genomes.
AB  - Pseudogenes are now known to be a regular feature of bacterial genomes and are found in particularly high numbers within the genomes of recently emerged bacterial pathogens. As most pseudogenes are recognized by sequence alignments, we use newly available genomic sequences to identify the pseudogenes in 11 genomes from 4 bacterial genera, each of which contains at least 1 human pathogen. The numbers of pseudogenes range from 27 in Staphylococcus aureus MW2 to 337 in Yersinia pestis CO92 (e.g. 1-8% of the annotated genes in the genome). Most pseudogenes are formed by small frameshifting indels, but because stop codons are A + T-rich, the two low-G + C Gram-positive taxa (Streptococcus and Staphylococcus) have relatively high fractions of pseudogenes generated by nonsense mutations when compared with more G + C-rich genomes. Over half of the pseudogenes are produced from genes whose original functions were annotated as 'hypothetical' or 'unknown'; however, several broadly distributed genes involved in nucleotide processing, repair or replication have become pseudogenes in one of the sequenced Vibrio vulnificus genomes. Although many of our comparisons involved closely related strains with broadly overlapping gene inventories, each genome contains a largely unique set of pseudogenes, suggesting that pseudogenes are formed and eliminated relatively rapidly from most bacterial genomes.
TI  - Mastoid subperiosteal abscess: a review of 51 cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present a large study on subperiosteal abscess (SA) that represents the most frequent complication of acute mastoiditis. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted on 49 patients who underwent mastoidectomy for SA. RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 8 months to 21 years. Two patients were re operated on the same side due to recurrent abscess. Forty-five percent of the patients were treated using antibiotics at home and 58.8% of patients had no history of middle ear infection prior to admission. CT underestimated abscess in two patients who were operated on based on their clinical signs. Perisinus abscess was drained during mastoidectomy in one child. Purulent discharge was obtained from the abscess in 41 cases. The most common isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Cholesteatoma was found during mastoidectomy in six patients (11.3%). Twenty-four patients (49%) developed postoperative sequela including various middle ear infections, mastoiditis, recurrent SA and impaired hearing. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral mainly children's disease that can recur. Cholesteatoma can associate the abscess and could be found in older children and recurrent abscess. High morbidity rate requires long-term follow-up for these patients.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - [Pleural empyema in children: Montpellier's experience].
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND METHOD: To assess the management of pleural empyema in pediatric from a medical and surgical experience and a review of the literature. STUDY: Fifty-eight cases were reviewed from January 98 to December 2003. 62.6% have already received antibiotherapy. Forty-three percent of cases were less than three years old. Initial cultures identified Streptococcus pneumoniae in 39%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 5.6%, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in only one case and were negative in 47%. A primitive or second-line thoracoscopy were used for drainage in two-third of the cases and mainly 6.95 days after admission. Located pleural empyema and major collected volume were the main indications for thoracoscopy. Three cases have been converted into open thoracotomy. One death occurred in an immunocompromised child. All patients were well at last follow-up. DISCUSSION: The frequency of parapneumonic empyema has increased since ten years. Progress of echography and endoscopy changed their management. Antibiotics have to be effective against pneumococcal infection. Chest tube drainage is necessary to assure the lung reexpansion in case of fibropurulent collection. The difficulty is to optimise the time of video-assisted thoracoscopy (VAT) using predictive criteria as loculations and pneumatoceles. VAT allowed the aspiration of pleural fluid and removing of fibrinous loculations. Moreover VAT achieved optimal adhesiolysis and the irrigation or decortication of the pleural cavity. VAT minimized duration of stay, of chest tube drainage and the indications of thoracotomy.
TI  - Silkworm pathogenic bacteria infection model for identification of novel virulence genes.
AB  - Silkworms are killed by injection of pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus  aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, into the haemolymph. Gene disruption mutants of S. aureus whose open reading frames were previously uncharacterized and that are conserved among bacteria were examined for their virulence in silkworms. Of these 100 genes, three genes named cvfA, cvfB, and cvfC were required for full virulence of S. aureus in silkworms. Haemolysin production was decreased in these mutants. The cvfA and cvfC mutants also had attenuated virulence in mice. S. pyogenes cvfA-disrupted mutants produced less exotoxin and had attenuated virulence in both silkworms and mice. These results indicate that the silkworm-infection model is useful for identifying bacterial virulence genes.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - Antimicrobial and healing activity of kefir and kefiran extract.
AB  - Kefir and its insoluble polysaccharide, kefiran, were both tested for antimicrobial and cicatrizing activities against several bacterial species and Candida albicans using an agar diffusion method. Comparator antimicrobials were also tested. Cicatrizing experiments were carried out on Wistar rats with induced skin lesions and Staphylococcus aureus inoculation, using a topical application of a 70% kefir gel. Both kefir and kefiran showed some activity against all organisms tested; the highest activity was against Streptococcus pyogenes. Cicatrizing experiments using 70% kefir gel had a protective effect on skin connective tissue and 7 days treatment enhanced wound healing compared with 5 mg/kg of neomycin-clostebol emulsion.
TI  - Human defensins.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. The eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. Mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal Paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (HBD-4) have been discovered. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity towards the Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Malassezia furfur. In addition, HBD-3 kills Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant S. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. In contrast to HBD-1 and HBD-2, significant expression of HBD-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. HBD-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. Its bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. Here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.
TI  - Generation of transposon insertion mutant libraries for Gram-positive bacteria by electroporation of phage Mu DNA transposition complexes.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis is a powerful technique for generating collections of insertion mutants for genetic studies. This paper describes how phage Mu DNA transposition complexes, transpososomes, can be exploited for gene delivery to efficiently introduce selectable markers to genomes of Gram-positive bacteria. Mu transpososomes were assembled in vitro with custom-designed mini-Mu transposons, concentrated, and electroporated into cells of three Gram-positive bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus suis. Within cells, the complexes reproduced an authentic DNA transposition reaction and integrated the delivered transposons into the bacterial genomes, yielding single-copy insertions. The integration efficiency among different species and strains of Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 1x10(1) to 2x10(4) c.f.u. (mug introduced transposon DNA)(-1). The strategy should be applicable to a variety of other Gram-positive species after initial optimization of certain key factors affecting transposon delivery, such as the preparation method of competent cells and physical parameters of electroporation. This study extends the scope of the Mu transpososome delivery-based genomic DNA integration strategy to Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, a straightforward generation of sizeable mutant banks is feasible for these bacteria, potentiating several types of genomic-level approaches for studies of a variety of important bacterial processes, such as pathogenicity.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of potential bacterial pathogens in adults with acute respiratory tract infections Prospective Epidemiological Network Investigating Community-acquired Infection SurveiLLance In Nagasaki (PENICILLIN) Study.
AB  - The prevalence and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens in acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) is not clear. We conducted a prospective community-based multicenter study in 45 centers across Nagasaki, Japan, between December 2001 and April 2002. We examined the nasopharyngeal or throat isolates in 930 adult outpatients with AURTIs. Potential bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes (from 6.8% patients), S. pneumoniae (5.3%), S. milleri group (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (26.0%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (17.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.2%), were isolated from 51.8% of the patients. Penicillin nonsusceptible phenotype accounted for 44.9% of S. pneumoniae isolates. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 9.1% were methicillin-resistant. In H. influenzae isolates, 6.7% produced beta-lactamase and 23.2% were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant. The results indicated that the potential bacterial pathogens were detected in the remarkable population of the adults with AURTIs and the current antimicrobial susceptibilities of such pathogens.
TI  - Cefdinir: an oral alternative to parenteral cephems.
AB  - Cost savings are possible if oral cephems of equivalent efficacy can be substituted for parenteral cephems. An in vitro study was performed to compare the activity of cefdinir, cefoxitin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against 243 clinical isolates of human pathogens. Activities were determined by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards microbroth dilution methodology using an inoculum of approximately 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL. Cefdinir was the single or equally most potent agent against Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that produced a variety of beta-lactamase types. Cefdinir was less potent than ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Haemophilus influenzae, but was 2- to 8-fold more potent than cefoxitin and 8- to 32-fold more potent than cefazolin. Cefdinir was slightly less potent than ceftazidime, against beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella catarrhalis. These data support clinical consideration of cefdinir as an alternative to parenteral cephems in infections where adequate tissue levels can be safely assured.
TI  - [Bacterially conditioned thromboembolism in dairy cows--a retrospective study of  31 necropsy cases with special consideration of the causative complex].
AB  - A study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern Bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. The most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). The most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was Arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (2), Mannheimia haemolytica (2) and Streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. In 27 of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome in children: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, toxin-mediated illness, like endotoxic shock, and is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension, multiorgan involvement, and desquamation. TSS reflects the most severe form of the disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A case definition for staphylococcal TSS was well established in the early 1980s and helped in defining the epidemiology. Since the late 1980s, a resurgence of highly invasive streptococcal infections, including a toxic shock-like syndrome, was noted worldwide and a consensus case definition for streptococcal TSS was subsequently proposed in 1993. Both TSS and the toxic shock-like syndrome occur at a lower incidence in children than in adults. Changes in the manufacturing and use of tampons led to a decline in staphylococcal TSS over the past decade, while the incidence of nonmenstrual staphylococcal TSS increased. Nonmenstrual TSS and menstrual TSS are now reported with almost equal frequency. The incidence of streptococcal TSS remains constant after its resurgence, but varies with geographic location. Streptococcal TSS occurs most commonly following varicella or during the use of NSAIDs. Sites of infection in streptococcal TSS are much deeper than in staphylococcal TSS, such as infection caused by blunt trauma, and necrotizing fasciitis. Bacteremia is more common in streptococcal TSS than in staphylococcal TSS. Mortality associated with streptococcal TSS is 5-10% in children, much lower than in adults (30-80%), and is 3-5% for staphylococcal TSS in children.TSS is thought to be a superantigen-mediated disease. Toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci act as superantigens that can activate the immune system by bypassing the usual antigen-mediated immune-response sequence. The host-pathogen interaction, virulence factors, and the absence or presence of host immunity determines the epidemiology, clinical syndrome, and outcome. Early recognition of this disease is important, because the clinical course is fulminant and the outcome depends on the prompt institution of therapy. Management of a child with TSS includes hemodynamic stabilization and appropriate antimicrobial therapy to eradicate the bacteria. Supportive therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors remain the main elements. An adjuvant therapeutic strategy may include agents that can block superantigens, such as intravenous immunoglobulin that contains superantigen neutralizing antibodies.
TI  - Intrinsic reduced susceptibility of serotype 6 Streptococcus pyogenes to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone resistance is common in Staphylococcus aureus, is increasing in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and is reported in Streptococcus pyogenes. METHODS: We surveyed 384 clinical isolates of S. pyogenes, isolated during 2002-2003, for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. We performed nucleotide sequencing of the parC and gyrA genes and determined the M/emm type for selected isolates. Additionally, we analyzed M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes isolated during 1918-2003 from diverse locations. RESULTS: Of the survey isolates, 10.9% had reduced zones of inhibition to ciprofloxacin in the disk-diffusion test and had elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations to other fluoroquinolones, compared with those of fully susceptible isolates. Of the resistant isolates, 90.5% were M/emm type 6, and all sequenced M/emm type 6 isolates contained a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 79 in parC. Strikingly, the same findings were also present in macrolide-resistant isolates from a recent outbreak of S. pyogenes infection in Pittsburgh and in the Lancefield reference strain of M type 6, which was isolated in 1918, decades before the development of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. CONCLUSION: M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes has intrinsic reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, as a result of a polymorphism in parC. This finding was also demonstrated in erythromycin-resistant M/emm type 6 S. pyogenes, which raises concern for the emergence of multidrug-resistant S. pyogenes.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - Augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. Among these, human cathelicidin CAP18/LL-37 (L1-S37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (K15-V32) of LL-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of modified peptides. METHODS: Antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microM corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarBlue assay using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. Furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using E. coli ML-35p as a target. RESULTS: By substituting E16 and K25 with two L residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer LL) was increased, and by further substituting Q22, D26 and N30 with three K residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer LLKKK) was enhanced. Among peptide derivatives, 18-mer LLKKK exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against S. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against E. coli ML-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer LLKKK vs. 18-mer LL, 18-mer K15-V32 and LL-37). CONCLUSIONS: Bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human CAP18/LL-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity, and 18-mer LLKKK is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Microbiology and management of infected neck cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review and describe the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of infected neck cysts. METHOD: Review the current medical literature and current textbooks. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the predominant aerobic isolates, while pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp., all part of the oral flora, are the predominant anaerobes. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage and resection may be necessary in case of suppuration. Prevention of suppuration can be achieved by surgical removal of cysts before acquisition of infection, or removal of those recurrently infected. CONCLUSION: Recognition of the importance of the skin or the oral flora in infected neck cysts can assist in the proper selection of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Borrelia burgdorferi binds fibronectin through a tandem beta-zipper, a common mechanism of fibronectin binding in staphylococci, streptococci, and spirochetes.
AB  - BBK32 is a fibronectin-binding protein from the Lyme disease-causing spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. In this study, we show that BBK32 shares sequence similarity with fibronectin module-binding motifs previously identified in proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry are used to confirm the binding sites of BBK32 peptides within the N-terminal domain of fibronectin and to measure the affinities of the interactions. Comparison of chemical shift perturbations in fibronectin F1 modules on binding of peptides from BBK32, FnBPA from S. aureus, and SfbI from S. pyogenes provides further evidence for a shared mechanism of binding. Despite the different locations of the bacterial attachment sites in BBK32 compared with SfbI from S. pyogenes and FnBPA from S. aureus, an antiparallel orientation is observed for binding of the N-terminal domain of fibronectin to each of the pathogens. Thus, these phylogenetically and morphologically distinct bacterial pathogens have similar mechanisms for binding to human fibronectin.
TI  - Colonisation rates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in the oropharynx of a young adult population.
AB  - There are very few reports on the rates of oropharyngeal colonisation by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in young adults. The present study found colonisation rates of 9.6% and 26.2%, respectively. These rates are two-fold higher than historical rates, indicating that these organisms may be more prevalent than thought previously. This finding may have important clinical consequences in certain populations, and requires further investigation.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Conserved interactions in the Staphylococcus aureus DNA PolC chromosome replication machine.
AB  - The PolC holoenzyme replicase of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus pathogen has been reconstituted from pure subunits. We compared individual S. aureus replicase subunits with subunits from the Gram-negative Escherichia coli polymerase III holoenzyme for activity and interchangeability. The central organizing subunit, tau, is smaller than its Gram-negative homolog, yet retains the ability to bind single-stranded DNA and contains DNA-stimulated ATPase activity comparable with E. coli tau. S. aureus tau also stimulates PolC, although they do not form as stabile a complex as E. coli polymerase III.tau. We demonstrate that the extreme C-terminal residues of PolC bind to and function with beta clamps from different bacteria. Hence, this polymerase-clamp interaction is highly conserved. Additionally, the S. aureus delta wrench of the clamp loader binds to E. coli beta. The S. aureus clamp loader is even capable of loading E. coli and Streptococcus pyogenes beta clamps onto DNA. Interestingly, S. aureus PolC lacks functionality with heterologous beta clamps when they are loaded onto DNA by the S. aureus clamp loader, suggesting that the S. aureus clamp loader may have difficulty ejecting from heterologous clamps. Nevertheless, these overall findings underscore the conservation in structure and function of Gram-positive and Gram-negative replicases despite >1 billion years of evolutionary distance between them.
TI  - [Diabetic foot infection. Bacteriologic analysis of 141 patients].
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a progressive disease with chronic complications. Feet  problems represent one of the most important complications. In a prospective study, we analyzed 298 species of bacteria isolated from 141 patients with community-acquired diabetic foot ulcers. The study was undertaken at a diabetic center and at the Federal University of Ceara, Brazil, from March/2000 to November/2001. The majority of patients had mild to moderate infections and was classified as Wagner's grades I and II. The samples were cultured using selective media. The identification and the susceptibility tests were done by conventional and automated methods. The most frequently occurring pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae (83.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (43.3%) and anaerobic bacteria (17%). Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 7.8% of the patients. ESBL producing strains were detected in 6% and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were recovered from 11.6% of the patients. Resistance among bacteria has increased largely, and became common even in community-acquired infections. Improvements in the routine etiologic diagnostics and antibiotic use strategies are required to avoid inadequate treatment and its well known dramatic consequences.
TI  - Group A streptococcal subdural empyema as a complication of varicella.
AB  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the 2 most common pathogens implicated in secondary invasive bacterial disease after varicella. We describe a 3-month-old male infant from British Columbia, Canada, who presented on day 5 of varicella skin rash with fever, seizures, lethargy, and evidence of intracranial hypertension. A prominent subdural empyema was documented, and Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from the subdural fluid. Central nervous system bacterial complications should be part of the differential diagnosis for infants and children with chickenpox who present with fever, lethargy, focal seizures, or similar neurologic findings. This case illustrates the importance of universal varicella vaccination to prevent associated bacterial complications of chickenpox.
TI  - Clinical challenges and unmet needs in the management of complicated skin and skin structure, and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin and soft tissue infections remain among the most frequently encountered infections in surgery, and their severity ranges from mild cellulitis to severe, necrotizing infections with high incidences of morbidity and mortality. Most commonly, these disorders result from skin lesions in a susceptible host, but sometimes develop following hematogenous spread from a previously unknown focus. METHODS: The current literature was reviewed to provide an up-to-date summary of the microbiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. Special conditions are also described, such as cellulitis, bite wounds and diabetic foot infections. The potential roles of several new drugs that have become available recently, or are currently in phase III clinical trials, are discussed. RESULTS: The causative pathogens are mostly gram-positive cocci from a patient's endogenous skin flora, but complicated infections often involve gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria related to the site and source of infection. Classifications are numerous and often confusing, occasionally leading to a prolonged diagnostic workup. Therapy should be initiated immediately following clinical diagnosis, including empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgical debridement, if necessary. Hospitalization is mandatory for those patients with constitutional symptoms of sepsis, failed outpatient therapy, or deeper infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis. The number and variety of resistant organisms in the community continues to increase steadily, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) currently the most common. Several new drugs that are active against MRSA are becoming available, and include those active broadly against gram-positive cocci, such as quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin. Tigecycline, a new antibiotic of the glycylcycline class, has extended broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including anaerobes and multi-resistant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: New, promising agents, with activity against multi-drug resistant gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, are aimed at filling the gap in the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
TI  - [Orbital cellulitis in children: a retrospective study of 33].
AB  - Orbital cellulitis is rare. However the high risk of severe ocular and neurological complications make early diagnosis and adequate therapy essential. The purpose of this retrospective study is to describe 33 cases observed in the pediatric infectious disease department of the Casablanca Children's Hospital in Morocco from 1994 to 2000. Orbital cellulitis was preseptal in 24 patients and retroseptal in 9. Infection occurred in relation with sinusitis in 10 cases, polydermitis in 8, wound infection in 6, ocular infection in 2, and dental abscess in 2. Ages ranged from 40 days to 15 years with a mean age of 5 years. Infants accounted for 25% of cases and always presented preseptal cellulitis. Fever and local edema were noted in all patients. Exophthalmia occurred in six patients and seizures in 2. The 9 cases of retroseptal cellulitis were complicated by empyema in 2 cases, meningitis in 1 case and thrombophlebitis of cavernous sinus with cerebromalacia in 1 case. Bacteriological testing identified micro-organisms in 10 cases, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Streptococcus B in 1, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Enterobacter Cloacae in land Acinitobacter jejuni in 1 case. Therapy was based on broad-spectrum antibiotics in association with surgery in the patient presenting in intracranial abscess. Ophthalmoplegia-like sequels including blindness, aphasia, and motor deficit occurred in 2 patients. Orbital cellulitis in children are usually preseptal and have a favorable prognosis. However prompt and adequate antibiotherapy is essential due to the risk of retroseptal involvement with inflammatory palpberal edema and possible cerebral extension.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute otitis media and otitis media recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who presented with acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy. Nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 72 patients, 40 with AOM and 32 with recurrent otitis media (ROM), were analysed. Thirty-six potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 34 (85 %) of the children from the AOM group, and 42 were isolated from 29 (91 %) of the children from the ROM group. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (n = 22), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 13), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 8) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9). Resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used was found in 37 instances in the AOM group as compared to 99 instances in the ROM group (P < 0.005). The difference between AOM and ROM was significant with Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.005), to amoxicillin/clavulanate (P < 0.005), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.01), to cefixime (P < 0.01) and to azithromycin (P < 0.01), and for H. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.025). These data illustrate the higher recovery rate of antimicrobial-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy than those with AOM.
TI  - Hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of extracts from Trichilia emetica Vahl. (Meliaceae).
AB  - Trichilia emetica Vahl. (Meliaceae) is a tree widely distributed in Tropical Africa. It has been used in Mali folk medicine for the treatment of various illnesses. The aim of this work was to study the hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of a crude aqueous extract from Trichilia emetica root. An ethyl ether fraction from the aqueous extract was also prepared and studied. We have examined the hepatoprotective activity of the extracts on CCl4-induced damage in rat hepatocytes, their toxicity using the brine shrimp bioassay and their antibacterial activity against clinical isolated bacterial strains, which are commonly responsible for respiratory infections. A preliminary phytochemical analysis showed a high polyphenolic content in the aqueous extract and the presence of limonoids in the ethyl ether fraction. These latter compounds may be considered responsible for the good activity against the bacterial strains tested. Trichilia emetica extracts exerted also a significant (P<0.05) hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 1000 microg/ml both on plasma membrane and mitochondrial function as compared to silymarin used as a positive control. These activities may be a result of the presence of either polyphenols or limonoids. Finally, both the aqueous extract and its ethyl ether fraction did not show toxicity (LC50>1000 microg/ml) in the brine shrimp bioassay.
TI  - Microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. Predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group A streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae . Anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while S. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. More than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. Management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. However, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. Untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. Death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.
TI  - Effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin and cefprozil on bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in the adenoids.
AB  - To compare the effects on the bacterial flora of the adenoids of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin or cefprozil, we enrolled in a prospective randomized study 60 children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy because of recurrent otitis media. They were randomized before surgery into 3 groups of 20 patients each: a no-therapy group, and groups with 10 days of either amoxicillin or cefprozil therapy. Core adenoid materials were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and facultative bacteria. The in vitro ability of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (AHS) to inhibit the growth of non-type B Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined. The number of organisms in adenoids obtained from patients treated with either antibiotic was reduced as compared to that in adenoids from controls. However, in patients treated with amoxicillin, a significant decline in the number of AHS, and an increase (in Staphylococcus aureus) or no change in the number of other beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) was noted. In contrast, in those treated with cefprozil, no change was noted in the frequency of recovery of AHS, and the number of BLPB decreased. Interfering AHS were more often recovered in patients treated with cefprozil. We conclude that the adenoids contain more interfering AHS after therapy with a second-generation oral cephalosporin (cefprozil) than after amoxicillin therapy. This study suggests a potential beneficial effect of using an antimicrobial that selectively spares interfering AHS while inhibiting BLPB.
TI  - Bone infection.
AB  - Osteomyelitis, or bone infection, affects all age groups and develops from various sources including haematogenously from distant infection foci, from external sources such as post-operative or post-traumatic wound infections and from adjoining soft tissue infections. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common pathogens of haematogenous osteomyelitis. Aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria have emerged as significant pathogens in some types of osteomyelitis while anaerobic bacteria are increasingly recognized as potential pathogens in non-haematogenous osteomyelitis. The emergence of antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern, although improvements in radiologic imaging, antibiotic treatment and heightened awareness have led to earlier detection such that long-term sequelae and morbidity are now primarily due to delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - A randomized crossover study investigating the influence of ranitidine or omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of cephalexin monohydrate.
AB  - Limited data characterize pharmacokinetic interactions between cephalexin and ranitidine, and no data exist for an interaction with proton pump inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ranitidine or omeprazole administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cephalexin. A randomized single- and multiple-dose crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects ingesting cephalexin before and after steady-state administration of ranitidine or omeprazole. Time-concentration profiles were determined and pharmacokinetic parameters were characterized using noncompartmental methods. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in accordance with the two 1-sided test for bioequivalence. The percentage of time that serum concentrations remain above the MIC(90) during the dosing interval (T > MIC(90)) for Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus associated with the pharmacokinetic profiles was calculated. The coadministration of cephalexin with ranitidine or omeprazole resulted in relatively minor changes in C(max), AUC(infinity), t(1/2), or CL/F. t(max) was significantly prolonged when cephalexin was administered with ranitidine or omeprazole. Suboptimal T > MIC(90) was observed for cephalexin irrespective of acid suppression. Delay in absorption of cephalexin resulted in a decrease in the percentage of T > MIC(90) for certain acid-suppressive regimens and pathogen combinations. With the exception of an increase in t(max), there were no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between cephalexin and ranitidine or omeprazole. Delayed t(max) associated with acid suppression may result in a diminished T > MIC(90).
TI  - Studies on antibacterial, antioxidant and fibroblast growth stimulation of wound  healing remedies from South Africa.
AB  - Aqueous and methanol extracts of Urtica urens, Capparis tomentosa, Dicoma anomala, Leonotis leonorus, Xysmalobium undulatum, Helichrysum foetidum, Pterocarpus angolensis, Terminalia sericea and Gunnera perpensa, plants documented as being used for topical wound healing in the literature, were tested for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methanol and water extracts of two of these plants, Terminalia sericea and Gunnera perpensa, were more active compared to the other extracts against Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects of the latter plants on fibroblast growth as well as oxidant production by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine were also studied. The water and methanol extracts of Terminalia sericea and Gunnera perpensa significantly decreased luciginin enhanced chemiluminescence at concentrations of 100 microg/ml and higher. However, the extracts had no effect on the growth of primary human fibroblasts.
TI  - Daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant Gram-positive infections. These infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. At present, daptomycin is approved for use in the US for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. The most common causative organisms in these types of infections are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Group C and G streptococci. Traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. Of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme reported that approximately 30% of S. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were MRSA. The standard treatment for MRSA infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. There is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with Gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in infancy: the Soroka experience: 1990-2000.
AB  - Acute mastoiditis (AM) is an uncommon but serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM). In the pre-antibiotic era, AM was seen more frequently than it is today, but it was rare in infants. However, in the last two decades an increase in the incidence of AM in infancy has been reported in the literature. During the years 1990-2002, we treated 113 patients with 128 episodes of AM; of them, 24 were infants (median age 6 months; 18 males) who suffered from 26 episodes of AM. Twenty developed AM as a complication of their first episode of AOM. One of the four infants with a prior history of AOM suffered from common variable immunodeficiency. A significant increase in the incidence of AM in infants was recorded during the study period (P = 0.01). The most common presenting clinical signs were post-auricular swelling and fever >38 degrees C (77% and 77%, respectively, of all patients). Seventeen episodes of AM were not treated with prior antibiotics. Tympanocentesis was performed in all episodes of AM. Middle ear fluid culture was positive in 17 (65%) of the 26 AM episodes. The most common pathogens cultured were Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 infants, 58% of all pathogens, 3/10 intermediately susceptible to penicillin) followed by Streptococcus pyogenes (4, 23%), non-typable H. influenzae (2, 12%) and S. aureus (1, 6%). Temporal bone CT showed bone destruction in 14 patients; 3 infants had subperiosteal abscesses and 3 lateral sinus thrombosis. Ten infants underwent mastoid surgery due to non-resolution of symptoms and signs with antibiotic therapy. Eight underwent cortical mastoidectomy with two patients undergoing ventilation tube introduction only. The remainder of the infants healed with conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) A significant increase in the incidence of AM in infants was recorded over the last decade, though a specific reason for this trend remains uncertain; (2) Most of the cases of AM followed the infant's initial AOM episode, and most of the infants had not received prior antibiotic therapy; (3) The clinical signs and symptoms of AM were more severe in infants than in older patients; (4) While S. pneumonia was the most common pathogen isolated in middle ear fluid cultures, the involvement of S. pyogenes in AM was higher than that reported in AOM.
TI  - Responses of fish chromatophore-based cytosensor to a broad range of biological agents.
AB  - A cytosensor based on living chromatophores from Betta splendens Siamese fighting fish was used to test several classes of biologically active agents. Tested agents include neurotransmitters, adenyl cyclase activators, cytoskeleton effectors, cell membrane effectors and protein synthesis inhibitors. Characteristic cell responses were analyzed, and potential cytosensor applications were considered. Streptococcus pyogenes toxins streptolysin S and streptolysin O, Clostridium tetani tetanolysin, Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin and Vibrio parahemolyticus hemolysin, all bacterial toxins that act on cell membranes, elicited a strong response from chromatophores. A comparison of purified toxin to actual bacterial culture from Vibrio parahemolyticus demonstrated a nearly identical chromatophore cell response pattern. This suggests that the cytosensor response is reflective of bacterial toxin production.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against selected respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of ertapenem was evaluated in comparison to 21  selected agents against a large collection of recently isolated respiratory tract pathogens including: 180 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 70 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 100 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additional in vitro tests (time-kill curves with ertapenem alone and in combination with four other agents) for S. pneumoniae were carried out. METHODS: MIC determinations and time-kill curves were carried out following the procedures suggested by the NCCLS. RESULTS: According to NCCLS susceptibility breakpoints, ertapenem was comparable to the most potent compounds tested for all pathogens studied. Ertapenem was 100% active against penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate S. pneumoniae and against 60% of penicillin-resistant strains. Time-kill tests at 4x MIC confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of ertapenem against these organisms. Interactions of ertapenem with several other agents against pneumococci resulted in clear synergic interactions (98.4%). Indifference was extremely rare and antagonism was not observed. All S. pyogenes strains tested were inhibited by ertapenem, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotypes. Ertapenem was also fully active against H. influenzae (100% susceptible) and M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-0.03 mg/L) even when capable of synthesizing beta-lactamases. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, were 100% susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ertapenem has a suitable spectrum of activity against organisms encountered in community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Anti-allergic action effect of Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract and its efficacy on atopic dermatitis].
AB  - Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract was examined in vitro for antibacterial effects, anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibitory effects on histamine release. Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract was also examined for efficacy on dermatitis in atopic dermatitis model mice (NC mice) and effects on keratinous moisture level and transepidermal water loss in miniature pigs. Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract had antibacterial effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus pyogenes; however this antibacterial effect varied with the temperature at which and conditions under which Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. was extracted. Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract at the final concentration of 2 mg/mL significantly inhibited the hyaluronidase activity; and at 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 mg/mL, it also significantly inhibited the histamine release. In the mice in which atopic dermatitis had been induced, 28-day administration of Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract at 4 and 400 mg/mL significantly inhibited aggravation of dermatitis without having effects on body weight. In the dorsal skin of miniature pigs, Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract at 4 and 400 mg/mL significantly increased keratinous moisture level with the increase in the number of dosing days, and caused no changes in transepidermal water loss. From the above results, it is clear that Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract inhibits both proliferation of bacteria and inflammation caused by antigens. Furthermore, it is suggested that Pseudolarix amabilis Rehd. extract will serve as a medicinal drug which effectively moistens the skin and prevents and heals dermatitis.
TI  - Identification of SpyA, a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, the aetiological agent of both respiratory and skin infections, produces numerous exotoxins to establish infection. This report identifies a new exotoxin produced by this organism, termed SpyA, for S. pyogenesADP-ribosylating toxin. SpyA, MW 24.9, has amino acid identity with the ADP-riboslytransferases (ADPRTs) Staphylococcus aureus EDIN and Clostridium botulinum C3. Recombinant SpyA was able to hydrolyse beta-NAD(+), and this activity was dependent on a glutamate at position 187. SpyA has a putative biglutamate active site, and similar to most biglutamate ADPRTs, was able to ADP-ribosylate poly-l-arginine. SpyA modified numerous proteins in both CHO and HeLa cell lysates. Two-dimesional gel analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of modified proteins indicated that vimentin, tropomyosin and actin, all cytoskeletal proteins, are targets. Expression of spyA in HeLa cells resulted in loss of actin microfilaments. We hypothesize that SpyA is produced by S. pyogenes to disrupt cytoskeletal structures and promote colonization of the host.
TI  - [Necrotising fasciitis in hyper-IgE syndrome].
AB  - Hyper-IgE syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, chronic eczematoid dermatitis, pneumonia, pneumatoceles, and extreme elevation of serum IgE. The most common pathogens are S. aureus, and C. albicans. Abnormalities of dentition, bone manifestations, and connective tissue disorders are also common features of the disease. The authors report here a 19-year-old female with hyper-IgE syndrome who developed necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. pyogenes cultured from the skin lesions. Association of hyper-IgE syndrome with necrotising fasciitis is a rarity in the medical literature. In addition to the case report, the authors describe here the major immunologic and clinical manifestations of hyper-IgE syndrome.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Influence of thiamphenicol on the primary functions of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes against Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Current antibiotic therapy encourages the use of antibiotics that may potentiate  the host's immune defences. We therefore investigated the effect of thiamphenicol (TAP), the active principle of thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteinate (TGA), on human granulocyte functions, mainly phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Streptococcus pyogenes. Our findings support the use of thiamphenicol in the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pyogenes as it acts directly against the pathogen as well as in cooperation with PMNs by eliciting their intracellular killing.
TI  - Effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on milk yield in dairy cows.
AB  - Our objective was to estimate the effects of the first occurrence of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM) on milk yield in 3071 dairy cows in 2 New York State farms. The pathogens studied were Streptococcus spp.,Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, other pathogens grouped together, and "no pathogen isolated." Data were collected from October 1999 to July 2001. Milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of CM and were sent to the Quality Milk Production Services laboratory at Cornell University for microbiological culture. The SAS statistical procedure PROC MIXED, with an autoregressive covariance structure, was used to quantify the effect of CM and several other control variables (herd, calving season, parity, month of lactation, J-5 vaccination status, and other diseases) on weekly milk yield. Separate models were fitted for primipara and multipara, because of the different shapes of their lactation curves. To observe effects of mastitis, milk weights were divided into several periods both pre- and postdiagnosis, according to when they were measured in relation to disease occurrence. Another category contained cows without the type of CM being modeled. Because all pathogens were modeled simultaneously, a control cow was one without CM. Among primipara, Staph. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and "no pathogen isolated" caused the greatest losses. Milk yield generally began to drop 1 or 2 wk before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. Mastitic cows often never recovered their potential yield. Among older cows, Streptococcus spp., Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. caused the most significant losses. Many multipara that developed CM were actually higher producers before diagnosis than their nonmastitic herd-mates. As in primipara, milk yield in multipara often began to decline shortly before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. Milk loss persisted until at least 70 d after diagnosis for Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and A. pyogenes. The tendency for higher producing cows to contract CM may mask its impact on cow health and production. These findings provide dairy producers with more information on which pathogen-specific CM cases should receive treatment and how to manage these cows, thereby reducing CM impact on cow well being and profitability.
TI  - Use of an oligonucleotide array for laboratory diagnosis of bacteria responsible  for acute upper respiratory infections.
AB  - We developed a diagnostic array of oligonucleotide probes targeting species-specific variable regions of the genes encoding topoisomerases GyrB and ParE of respiratory bacterial pathogens. Suitable broad-range primer sequences were designed based on alignment of gyrB/parE sequences from nine different bacterial species. These species included Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Specific probe sequences were selected by comparative analysis against the European Bioinformatics Database, as well as gyrB/parE sequences generated for this study. To verify specificity, at least six initial oligonucleotide probe sequences per bacterial species were tested by hybridization on a solid glass support using culture collection strains as templates. Finally, three oligonucleotide probes per bacterial species were utilized to examine 65 middle ear fluid and 29 throat swab samples. The sensitivities of the developed assay compared to classic culture from middle ear fluid samples for H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae were 96 (93 for culture), 73 (93 for culture), and 100% (78% for culture), respectively. No cross-reactivity with bacterial species belonging to the normal oral flora was observed when the 29 throat swab samples were studied. The sensitivity of the assay to detect S. pyogenes from these samples was 93% (80% for culture). These results provide a proof of concept for the diagnostic use of microarray technology based on broad-range topoisomerase gene amplification, followed by hybridization and specific detection of bacterial species.
TI  - Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  - Comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. This process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial DNA. Many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. Two situations can be distinguished: Vibrio cholerae, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. These prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. Prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile DNA elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. Prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. In many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific DNA sequences. In addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. The current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.
TI  - Survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  - The survival and surface adherence ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin C) were investigated The bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% Tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). The Gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their Gram-positive counterparts. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did not support the growth of the other bacteria. The effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated The properties were not altered significantly except for pH shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by E. coli and S. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin C. Adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. Populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). Rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new 7 beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins.
AB  - Selected 7beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins (1a-e) were synthesised and tested for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. All compounds synthesised (1a-e) showed an in vitro antimicrobial activity similar to that of ceftriaxone and cefpirome against the Gram-positive bacteria, and superior to that of penicillin and cefaclor against pen-R Staphylococcus aureus species. Like all beta-lactam agents, compounds 1a-e were in an inactive Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC > 32 microg/ml) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus species. Furthermore, as expected, no cross-resistance was observed against the erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus pyogenes strain. Finally, it is worth underlining that compounds 1a and 1e showed a similar activity to that of ceftriaxone and superior to cefaclor against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, a key respiratory tract infection (RTI) causing pathogen difficult to treat with currently marketed antibiotics.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Detection of circulating superantigens in an intensive care unit population.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Plasma concentrations of superantigens were measured in an intensive care unit (ICU) population and the relationship of superantigen positive rates with the presence of sepsis was investigated. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected at least twice a week from 78 patients whose primary diagnoses were abdominal disorders (n = 27), respiratory disorders (n = 11), trauma (n = 10), burns (n = 10), cardiovascular disorders (n = 4), neurological disorders (n = 2), and others (n = 14). Five different species of superantigens, i.e., staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, and C (SEA, SEB, and SEC), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Significant levels of plasma superantigens were detected in 16 patients. SEA was found in seven patients, SEB in four patients, SEC in two patients, TSST-1 in six patients, and SPEA in five patients. Superantigen detection rates were 6% (1/17) in patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 0% (0/21) in SIRS patients without infection, 31% (5/16) in septic patients without shock, and 42% (10/24) in septic shock patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of superantigens was confirmed in part of the ICU population. The role of superantigens in the pathogenesis of sepsis remains to be determined.
TI  - Cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's head region of cot mattress materials. Significantly higher bacterial population densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. The following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of S. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). Prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of Escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. These findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for SIDS associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. Clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and Streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.
TI  - Emerging gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - Over the last several decades, a number of previously known or newly described species of gram-positive bacteria have emerged as important human pathogens, particularly in industrialized countries. These microbes have demonstrated an impressive ability to produce an array of striking infectious diseases never before seen or only infrequently encountered in the past. Despite aggressive therapeutic intervention, many of these conditions portend significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera have figured prominently in this regard, with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci being regarded as the most important species. This review focuses on the clinical and microbiologic aspects of key emerging infections caused by this group of microorganisms.
TI  - Early recognition and treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock.
AB  
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Managing toxic shock syndrome with antibiotics.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious disorder with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 3/100,000 persons. TSS is mainly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, beta-lactam and lincosamides, such as clindamycin, are the first-line drugs. Yet, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high; highlighting the role of bacterial toxin-mediated activation of the inflammatory cascade in TSS pathogenesis. Further strategies should be targeted towards interfering with the interaction between bacterial toxins and host T cells. This paper aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathomechanisms, and clinical presentation of TSS, and criteria for selecting drugs among available antibiotics.
TI  - Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome--at last the etiology is clear?
AB  - A decade after the superantigen hypothesis for KD was first suggested, it has still not been either proven or refuted conclusively. Although initial optimism for the hypothesis was quashed by a series of published papers apparently refuting the idea, in the last few years there have been a number of good studies providing evidence in support of the superantigen hypothesis. Whether this renewed enthusiasm is justified will hopefully become clear in the near future. Ultimately, accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatment, and preventative strategies depend on the unraveling of the immunopathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Retrospective assessment of subacute or chronic osteomyelitis in children and young adults.
AB  - To identify factors associated with and to describe treatment outcomes of pediatric subacute or chronic osteomyelitis (S/CO), we retrospectively identified 52 patients with S/CO from January 1994 to November 1999 seen at a large pediatric hospital infectious disease clinic. S/CO was defined by the following: >10 days of clinical symptoms; radiographic, surgical, or pathologic changes consistent with S/CO; or relapse of prior osteomyelitis. Of these patients 63% were male, median age 9 years. Bones involved included vertebra (19% of subjects), femur (17%), finger (12%), humerus (10%), and tibia (8%). Sixty-five percent had at least 1 risk factor (most commonly hardware, neurologic disease or preceding trauma, sepsis, or surgery). Blood, bone, or wound aspirate cultures were positive in 67%, most commonly for Staphylococcus aureus. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 88% of 41 patients at the time of diagnosis. Intravenous antibiotics were given for a median of 6 weeks and oral antibiotics for a median of 4.5 months. One child had a complication. In conclusion, consideration of S/CO should be high when predisposing factors are present. ESR may be useful for determining effectiveness and duration of therapy. With prolonged antibiotic therapy nearly all patients demonstrated resolution of disease.
TI  - Crystallographic and mutational data show that the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin J can use a common binding surface for T-cell receptor binding and dimerization.
AB  - The protein toxins known as superantigens (SAgs), which are expressed primarily by the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, are highly potent immunotoxins with the ability to cause serious human disease. These SAgs share a conserved fold but quite varied activities. In addition to their common role of cross-linking T-cell receptors (TCRs) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules, some SAgs can cross-link MHC-II, using diverse mechanisms. The crystal structure of the streptococcal superantigen streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin J (SPE-J) has been solved at 1.75 A resolution (R = 0.209, R(free) = 0.240), both with and without bound Zn(2+). The structure displays the canonical two-domain SAg fold and a zinc-binding site that is shared by a subset of other SAgs. Most importantly, in concentrated solution and in the crystal, SPE-J forms dimers. These dimers, which are present in two different crystal environments, form via the same face that is used for TCR binding in other SAgs. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that this face is also used for TCR binding SPE-J. We infer that SPE-J cross-links TCR and MHC-II as a monomer but that dimers may form on the antigen-presenting cell surface, cross-linking MHC-II and eliciting intracellular signaling.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - New antimicrobial peptide active against Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Human and animal cystatins have been shown to inhibit the replication of certain viruses and bacteria, though it is not directly demonstrated that the effects are due to protease inhibitory capacity of the cystatins. We report antibacterial properties of a novel antimicrobial peptidyl derivative, (2S)-2-(N(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-leucylamido)-1-[(E)-cinnamoylamido]-3- methylbutane, structurally based upon the aminoterminal segment of the inhibitory centre of the human cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. METHODS: Clinical isolates of group A, B, C and G streptococci were collected. The antibacterial activity of Cystapep 1 derivative was tested by agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Cystapep 1, displayed antibacterial activity against several clinically important Gram-positive bacteria. It displayed minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 16 microg/ml for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In radial agar diffusion assays, groups A, B, C and G streptococci as well as staphylococci were generally susceptible to the action of Cystapep 1, whereas pneumococci and enterococci were less susceptible. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cystapep 1 also showed high activity against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) and multi-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), suggesting its mechanism of action to be different from most currently used antibiotics.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Identification and characterization of bacterial-binding property in the type III repeat domain of fibronectin.
AB  - To characterize fibronectin binding with Granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. Thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by Western blot. The epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the cell-binding domain, and not in the N-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. While these two species could bind to both the N-terminal and central portion, Escherichia coli and G. adiacens bind only to the latter. Excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the N-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Twinned or not twinned, that is the question: crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the 2F1(3)F1 module pair of human fibronectin.
AB  - Human fibronectin (Fn) is a large multidomain protein found in the extracellular  matrix and plasma. It is involved in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration during embryogenesis and wound healing. The ability to bind Fn is a characteristic that has been demonstrated for a number of pathogens. For Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in particular, Fn-binding bacterial proteins (FnBPs) have been shown to mediate not only bacterial adhesion to host cells but also the uptake of bacteria by the cells. FnBPs interact with the amino-terminal region of Fn, where five type I ((1-5)F1) Fn modules are located. Although the structures of two F1 module pairs have been determined by NMR, no X-ray structures have been reported. To explore the conformational interactions between modules and the binding properties of FnBPs, the (2)F1(3)F1 module pair was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method at 298 K. 12 X-ray diffraction data sets have been collected: six on an in-house rotating anode (three native, one Pt derivative and two peptide-bound) and six at synchrotron-radiation sources (two native and four derivative). Following analysis of these data, some of which have very high multiplicity (up to 50), probable space-group assignments were made (P42(1)2, P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2) and the possibly twinned nature of the crystals was investigated using six different tests. The results presented here suggest that the crystals are not twinned.
TI  - Peptide antagonists of superantigen toxins.
AB  - Superantigens produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are among the most lethal of toxins. Toxins in this large family trigger an excessive cellular immune response leading to toxic shock. Superantigens are secreted by the bacteria as diverse natural mixtures, a complexity that demands development of broad-spectrum countermeasures. We used a rational approach to design short peptides with homology to various domains in a typical superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxin B) and screened each peptide for its ability to antagonize, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, superantigen-mediated induction of the genes encoding T helper 1 cytokines that mediate shock: interleukin-2, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor. A dodecamer peptide proved a potent antagonist against widely different superantigens. This peptide protected mice from killing by superantigens and it was able to rescue mice undergoing toxic shock. The antagonist peptide shows homology to a beta-strand-hinge-alpha-helix domain that is structurally conserved among superantigens, yet currently of unknown function and remote from the binding sites for the known ligands essential for T cell activation, the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule and T cell receptor. The antagonist activity of this peptide thus identifies a novel domain in superantigens that is critical for their toxic action. The antagonist peptide provides a new tool for understanding the mechanism of excessive human immune response activation by superantigens that occurs during toxic shock and for identification of a novel target ligand that may interact with this superantigen domain.
TI  - Regulation of IDO-mediated bacteriostasis in macrophages: role of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents.
AB  - Induction of IDO is also under strict control by the immune system and we have previously shown that there are a number of cytokines involved in the down-regulation of IDO induction. In clinical practice anti-inflammatory substances and antibiotics are commonly used and may influence the outcome of bacterial infection. We analysed the IFNgamma-dependant IDO induction and bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus and Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDM) from cord blood and peripheral blood of healthy adult donors with attention to the effect of down-regulatory cytokines and of two commonly used anti-inflammatory agents, hydrocortisone and indomethacin, on both IDO activity and bacterial growth. In addition to this we were interested in the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic ampicillin on this IDO-mediated effect, the premise being that for a substantial period of antibiotic therapy the infection site is exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. We found that after stimulation with IFNgamma, MDM inhibited streptococcal growth. This was due to IFNgamma-induced IDO activity as demonstrated by reconstitution of growth by supplemental tryptophan. This IDO-mediated bacteriostasis was inhibited by the cytokines IL-10, IL-4 and TGFbeta. Furthermore, addition of indomethacin to IFNgamma stimulated MDM also resulted in the abrogation of the IDO-induced bacteriostasis, a result of the inhibition of IDO induction. Surprisingly, co-stimulation with hydrocortisone and IFNgamma apparently increased the IDO activity in cord blood MDM, but had no effect on the IDO-activity of adult peripheral blood MDM. Bacteriostasis in cord blood MDM, on the other hand, was not affected by co-stimulation with hydrocortisone. Ampicillin, in sub-inhibitory concentrations had no effect on the IDO activity itself but did have a synergistic effect on the IDO-induced bacteriostasis in MDM cultures. We conclude that therapy with indomethacin may increase the risk of clinically important bacterial infection due to the inhibition of the IDO-induced bacteriostasis. In addition sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin may play a role in the area of infection where IFNgamma stimulated macrophages are to be found in abundance.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Traditional medicine in north Cote-d'Ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in North Cote-d'Ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on Gram positive bacteria. Of these, 10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin M, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin B. The most active was Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae) followed by Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Desv.) J.H. Kirkbr. & Wiersema (Caesalpinaceae), Waltheria lanceolata R. Br. ex Mast. (Sterculiaceae), Uapaca togoensis Pax. (Euphorbiaceae), Ximenia americana L. (Olacaceae), Khaya senegalensis (Ders.) A. Juss. (Meliaceae), Lannea acida A. Rich. (Anacardiaceae), Cissus populnea Guill. & Perr. (Vitaceae), Keetia hispida (Benth.) Bridson (Rubiaceae) and Ficus thonningii (Miq.) A. Rich. (Moraceae). This is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. The results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.
TI  - Overview of cefdinir: pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in the treatment of  uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections commonly are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefdinir, an extended spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin is a safe and effective means of treating skin infections caused by these organisms, as well as many gram-negative pathogens. This article summarizes the pharmacokinetics, dosing schedule, adverse event profile, and efficacy data for cefdinir in adult and pediatric, populations in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Common pathogens and differential diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - The major organisms responsible for skin infections are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. To produce a disease state, both organisms must overcome the body's natural defenses, adhere to the skin, invade the tissue, and proliferate. Often, endogenous skin microflora can lead to systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The differential diagnosis of skin infections is key to successful therapy and requires a thorough knowledge of the patient's clinical history and immune status. Laboratory analysis often can assist in the pathogenic differentiation. Examples of common skin infections are illustrated herein.
TI  - Epidemiology and prevention of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes remain the 2 major organisms responsible for most common skin and soft tissue infections. While methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) typically is considered a hospital-acquired organism, outbreaks of community-acquired MRSA are being reported. Simple interventions can reduce the spread of this infection. Erysipelas is a streptococcal syndrome with high morbidity. The epidemiology has changed, with an increasing number of cases involving the lower extremities. Risk factors for erysipelas can be identified, which allow clinicians to target patients at high risk for recurrent disease. Although staphylococci and streptococci are the predominant cutaneous pathogens, enterococci and gram-negative organisms account for a significant proportion of skin infections.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(7-aminomethyl-5-azaspiro [2,4] hept-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxyl ic acid and its analogues].
AB  - AIM: To find new antibacterial agents of quinolone with high activity and low toxicity. METHODS: To design and synthesize 7-(7-aminomethyl-5-azaspiro [2,4] hept-5-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxyl ic acid and its analogues, and to study their antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Twenty new compounds (2 - 11, 17 - 26) were obtained including five targeted compounds (22 - 26). The structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1HNMR, MS and HRMS. Compounds 22 - 26 showed broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Especially for compound 24, the relevant MIC values for 13 strains of Gram-positive organisms were < 0.001 - 0.03 mg(-1), including 4 strains of S. pneumoniae, 2 strains of S. pyogenes, 3 strains of S. aureus and 2 strains of Enterococci which exhibited more potent activity than contrast agents (clinafloxacin and gatifloxacin). The MIC values of 24 for 6 strains Gram-positive organisms were 0.01 - 1 mg x L(-1), which exhibited equal or lower activity than contrast agents. They were more effective than ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin against intraperitoneal infections caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus in mice. CONCLUSION: Compounds (23, 24 and 26) showed excellent antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo and should be worth further investigation.
TI  - Serious bacterial infections in newborn infants in developing countries.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The overwhelming majority of the world's annual 4 million neonatal deaths occur in developing countries. This review therefore briefly addresses the burden, aetiology, prevention and management of serious neonatal bacterial infections in low-income settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Bacterial infection is the biggest cause of neonatal admissions to hospitals, and probably the biggest cause of morbidity in the community, but its burden is unclear. The commonest serious infections involve bacteraemia, meningitis and respiratory infection, and case fatality rates may be as high as 45%. Key pathogens are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The incidence of neonatal infections with group B streptococcus is highly variable, as is the spectrum of antimicrobial resistance. SUMMARY: Current areas of research include the rectification of micronutrient deficiencies, neonatal skin care, appropriate breastfeeding recommendations, cleansing of the birth canal, and simplified methods of diagnosis of infection. Operational activities include the control of neonatal tetanus, the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, integrated strategies for improving pregnancy, childbirth and neonatal survival, community-based management of acute respiratory infections, and community-based management of neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of a novel class of 4'-substituted 16-membered ring macrolides derived from tylosin.
AB  - Novel 4'-substituted 16-membered ring macrolides were synthesized by the cleavage of the mycarose sugar of tylosin and subsequent modification of 4'-hydroxyl group. This new class of macrolide antibiotics exhibited potent activity against some key erythromycin-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Superantigens: structure-function relationships.
AB  - Superantigens are a class of highly potent immuno-stimulatory molecules produced  by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These toxins possess the unique ability to interact simultaneously with MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors, forming a trimolecular complex that induces profound T-cell proliferation. The resultant massive cytokine release causes epithelial damage and leads to capillary leak and hypotension. The staphylococcal superantigens are designated staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C (and antigenic variants), D, E, and the recently discovered enterotoxins G to Q, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. The streptococcal superantigens include the pyrogenic exotoxins A (and antigenic variants), C, G-J, SMEZ, and SSA. Superantigens are implicated in several diseases including toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever and food poisoning; and their function appears primarily to debilitate the host sufficiently to permit the causation of disease. Structural studies over the last 10 years have provided a great deal of information regarding the complex interactions of these molecules with their receptors. This, combined with the wealth of new information from genomics initiatives, have shown that, despite their common molecular architecture, superantigens are able to crosslink MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors by a variety of subtly different ways through the use of various structural regions within each toxin.
TI  - Skin infections of the limbs of Polynesian children.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to obtain information regarding the incidence of cellulitis or cutaneous abscess in children of Polynesian ethnicity (including New Zealand Maori), and to calculate the relative risk increase versus other ethnicities. METHODS: We reviewed all patients aged between 1 to 14 years who were admitted at our tertiary care institution during the year 2000. Ninety-one children (of 10 different ethnicities) with skin infections were identified. RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was cutaneous abscess (46 of 91 cases, 50.5%), followed by cellulitis (45 of 91 cases, 49.5%). The most common location of infection was the lower limb (79.1%). The major pathogenic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. All but one of the children had an uneventful recovery. The incidence of infection in the Polynesian children was 137.7 per 100,000, and the incidence in European children (and children of other ethnic groups) was 35.4 per 100,000. In addition, we calculated a relative risk increase of 3.89 (95% confidence interval of 2.33 to 6.52, p <0.05), which underlines the increased risk that Polynesian children suffer from skin infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing (in detail) how Polynesian children are affected by a high incidence and increased relative risk of skin infections in their limbs (arms and legs). However, further research (to identify whether genetic disposition or social and environmental circumstances are involved) is required.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. Cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. Present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. Three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of AOM received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. Clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. There was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. A satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. In conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. Moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - Concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). The procedure was scheduled at four different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Five patients were studied at each point of time. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. Bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the NCCLS guidelines. Mean (+/-S.D.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/L and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/L, respectively. Levels above 1.0 mg/L were detected as long as 24 h. The peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against Staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against Streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative genomics of gene-family size in closely related bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping microbiologists understand the factors involved in gene innovation. Among these, the expansion and reduction of gene families appears to have a fundamental role in this, but the factors influencing gene family size are unclear. RESULTS: The relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome size, largely due to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. Bacteria undergoing genome reduction display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene families are reduced to one or a few members. Gene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and physiological function. Large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they are probably older, and certain functions (such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are overrepresented in large families. The size of a given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of the same species and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families are vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable preservation of copy numbers in widely different ecotypes indicates a functional role for the different copies rather than simply a back-up role. When different genera are compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports this view. HGT can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families, as exemplified by a comparison between saprophytic and enterohemorrhagic strains of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Interplay between superantigens and immunoreceptors.
AB  - Superantigens (SAGs) cause a massive T-cell proliferation by simultaneously binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells. These T-cell mitogens can cause disease in host, such as food poisoning or toxic shock. The best characterized groups of SAGs are the bacterial SAGs secreted by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite a common overall three-dimensional fold of these SAGs, they have been shown to bind to MHC class II in different ways. Recently, it has also been shown that SAGs have individual preferences in their binding to the TCRs. They can interact with various regions of the variable beta-chain of TCRs and at least one SAG seems to bind to the alpha-chain of TCRs. In this review, different subclasses of SAGs are classified based upon their binding mode to MHC class II, and models of trimolecular complexes of MHC-SAG-TCR molecules are described in order to reveal and understand the complexity of SAG-mediated T-cell activation.
TI  - Detection of pathogenic bacteria in skin lesions of patients with chiclero's ulcer. Reluctant response to antimonial treatment.
AB  - We investigated the bacterial flora present in skin lesions of patients with chiclero's ulcer from the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico using conventional culture methods (11 patients), and an immunocolorimetric detection of pathogenic Streptococcus pyogenes (15 patients). Prevalence of bacteria isolated by culture methods was 90.9% (10/11). We cultured, from chiclero's ulcers (60%), pathogenic bacterial such as Staphylococcus aureus (20%), S. pyogenes (1.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.6%), Morganella morganii (1.6%), and opportunist pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella spp. (20.0%), Enterobacter spp. (20%), and Enterococcus spp. (20%). We also cultured coagulase-negative staphylococci in 40% (4/10) of the remaining patients. Micrococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci constituted the bacterial genuses more frequently isolated in the normal skin of patients with chiclero's ulcer and healthy individuals used as controls. We also undertook another study to find out the presence of S. pyogenes by an immunocolorimetric assay. This study indicated that 60% (9/15) of the ulcerated lesions, but not normal controls, were contaminated with S. pyogenes. Importantly, individuals with purulent secretion and holding concomitant infections with S. pyogenes, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, M. morganii, and E. durans took longer to heal Leishmania (L.) mexicana infections treated with antimonial drugs. Our results suggest the need to eliminate bacterial purulent infections, by antibiotic treatment, before starting antimonial administration to patients with chiclero's ulcer.
TI  - Differences in potency of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin G against streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens: implications for therapy of toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Administration of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin G (IVIG) has been proposed as adjunctive therapy for toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. We investigated whether superantigen-containing culture supernatants prepared from streptococcal isolates (n=21) and staphylococcal isolates (n=20) from cases of severe sepsis were inhibited to an equal extent by IVIG in proliferation experiments that used human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All 3 IVIG preparations tested were highly efficient in neutralizing the superantigens, and most supernatants were completely inhibited at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 mg IVIG/mL. An important finding was that culture supernatants from S. pyogenes isolates were consistently inhibited to a greater extent than those of S. aureus isolates (P<.01). The findings demonstrate that staphylococcal superantigens are not inhibited as efficiently as streptococcal superantigens by IVIG, and, hence, a higher dose of IVIG may be required for therapy of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in order to achieve protective titers and clinical efficacy.
TI  - New antibacterial agents derived from the DNA gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  - Cyclothialidine (1, Ro 09-1437) is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from Streptomyces filipinensis NR0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. It acts by competitively inhibiting the ATPase activity exerted by the B subunit of DNA gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the cytoplasmic membrane. To explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. From a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (SAR) were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (X) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for DNA gyrase inhibitory activity. The variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (XI). On the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. By improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - Daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci. It is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by specified Gram-positive cocci. In vitro, daptomycin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, group C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. In two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with cSSSIs, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). Clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data). In patients with cSSSIs, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin were similar. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased CPK levels and muscle symptoms that were not associated with any comorbid factors.
TI  - Age-, site-, and time-specific differences in pediatric deep neck abscesses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify presentations, organisms, and locations of deep neck abscesses in children. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital. The study population comprised 169 patients younger than 19 years who were surgically treated for deep neck abscesses between 1989 and 1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Resolution of abscess. RESULTS: Neck mass (91%), fever (86%), cervical adenopathy (83%), poor oral intake (66%), and neck stiffness (59%) were common in all ages. Patients younger than 4 years, compared with patients 4 years or older, presented with agitation (50% vs 14%), cough (35% vs 14%), drooling (27% vs 12%), lethargy (46% vs 33%), oropharyngeal abnormalities (45% vs 60%), respiratory distress (5% vs 2%), retractions (5% vs 2%), rhinorrhea (53% vs 15%), stridor (4% vs 2%), and trismus (14% vs 53%). Children younger than 1 year were infected with Staphylococcus aureus (79%) vs group A streptococcus (6%). Children 1 year or older were infected with group A streptococcus (29%) vs S aureus (16%). Retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal regions were involved in children 1 year or older (49%) vs younger than 1 year (21%). Anterior or posterior triangles and submandibular or submental regions were involved in 39% and 36%, respectively, of children younger than 1 year vs 30% and 23%, respectively, of children 1 year or older. Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses yielded group A streptococcus (34%) vs S aureus (11%). Anterior and posterior triangle abscesses yielded S aureus (35%) vs group A streptococcus (19%), as did submandibular and submental abscesses (42% vs 19%). CONCLUSIONS: Abscesses in children younger than 1 year affected anterior or posterior triangles and submandibular or submental regions, yielding S aureus. Abscesses in children 1 year or older affected retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal regions, yielding group A streptococcus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute maxillary sinusitis and maxillary sinusitis recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who present with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) or maxillary sinusitis that recurred (RMS) after amoxicillin therapy. METHODS: Analysis of nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 70 patients, 42 with AMS and 28 with RMS. RESULTS: Thirty-eight potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 36 (86%) of the children from the AMS group, and 40 were isolated from 26 (93%) of the children from the RMS group. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (21 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (17), Moraxella catarrhalis (15), Streptococcus pyogenes (13) and Staphylococcus aureus (12). Resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used was found in 34 instances in the AMS group compared to 93 instances in the RMS group (P < 0.005). The difference between AMS and RMS was significant with S. pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (P < 0.0025), to co-amoxiclav (P < 0.0025), to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.05), to cefixime (P < 0.05), and to azithromycin (P < 0.05), and for H. influenzae to amoxicillin (P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate the higher recovery rate of antimicrobial-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had maxillary sinusitis that recurred after amoxicillin therapy than those with AMS.
TI  - L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall constituent of Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the lectin pathway of complement.
AB  - The lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. Three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, and H-ficolin. The importance of MBL in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. This report shows that L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component found in all Gram-positive bacteria. Immobilized LTA from Staphylococcus aureus binds L-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent C4 turnover. C4 activation correlates with serum L-ficolin concentration, but not with serum MBL levels. L-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of C4 turnover were observed on LTA purified from other clinically important bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. None of the LTA preparations bound MBL, H-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, C1q.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin against isolates of key respiratory pathogens: a pooled analysis of phase III studies.
AB  - A pooled analysis of data from 13 phase III studies of telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis or group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis was undertaken. Causative key respiratory tract pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) were isolated at entry to the studies from cultures of relevant respiratory samples and tested for their susceptibility to telithromycin, penicillin and macrolides (erythromycin A). The combined clinical and bacteriological efficacy of telithromycin at the post-therapy, test-of-cure visit (days 17-24) was assessed in patients from whom a microbiologically evaluable pathogen was isolated at entry. More than 98% of key respiratory pathogens isolated, including penicillin G- and macrolide (erythromycin A)-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, demonstrated full or intermediate susceptibility to telithromycin in vitro at the breakpoints of < or = 1.0 mg/L (susceptible) and 2.0 mg/L (intermediate) used for the purpose of evaluating the susceptibility of isolates recovered during the clinical trials. Treatment with telithromycin 800 mg once-daily for 5, 7 or 7-10 days resulted in high rates of clinical cure (88.5%) and a satisfactory bacteriological outcome (88.9%), similar to the figures seen with comparator antibacterial agents. Clinical cure and eradication rates were good for all key respiratory pathogens, including penicillin G- and macrolide (erythromycin A)-resistant S. pneumoniae. The results suggest that telithromycin will provide effective empirical therapy for community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Germisol on bacterial strains isolated from dental patients.
AB  
TI  - Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography detection of ribosomal mutations conferring macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Mutations in genes coding for L4 (rplD) or L22 (rplV) ribosomal proteins or in 23S rRNA (rrl gene) are reported as a cause of macrolide resistance in streptococci and staphylococci. This study was aimed at evaluating a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique as a rapid mutation screening method. Portions of these genes were amplified by PCR from total DNA of 48 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 6), Streptococcus oralis (n = 2), and group G streptococcus (n = 2). Thirty-seven of these strains were resistant to macrolides and harbored one or several mutations in one or two of the target genes, and 11 were susceptible. PCR products were analyzed by DHPLC. All mutations were detected, except a point mutation in a pneumococcal rplD gene. The method detected one mutated rrl copy out of six in S. aureus. This automated method is promising for screening of mutations involved in macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - [Right-sided infective endocarditis with a large size vegetation].
AB  - A 2-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect(VSD) had suffered from right-sided infective endocarditis with a vegetation 1.0 cm in size, involving pulmonary valve. Resection of the vegetation and partial resection of the pulmonary valve and patch closure of the VSD was performed after 3 weeks intravenous antibiotic therapy. In right-sided infective endocarditis, it is still unclear, however, which factors may be useful in predicting outcome or determining the need of surgical intervention. We recognize that following factors are the risk for need of surgical intervention. 1. persistent infection, 2. sever right-sided heart failure, 3. multiple embolic episodes, 4. infected by Staphylococcus aureus, 5. infection involving the annulus of the valve, 6. infection of prosthetic valve, 7. vegetation which is floppy and greater than 1.0 cm in size.
TI  - [Efficacy of intra-lesional glucantime in the treatment of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in basic health care conditions].
AB  - A randomized placebo-controlled trial treating cutaneous lesions due to Leishmania major with intralesionnel glucantime, was conducted in El Guettar between december 1994 and June 1995, in order to assess efficacy of this therapy under field conditions. It included 109 patients: 52 were administrated glucantime and 57 received local treatment (eosin 5% and alcohol 95%). Prognostic factors were similar in both groups. Results did not reveal a significant difference between glucantime and eosin regarding the rapidity of the healing of lesions. However, scars seem to be of better quality among the glucantime group. Bacterial super infection was noticed among 57.6% of humid lesions sampled among 33 patients. Isolated strains included group A streptococcus (22%), staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) or an association of both agents (61.1%). Resistance profile indicated that streptococcus and staphylococcus respond well to macrolids compared to other antibiotic groups.
TI  - Acute bacterial skin infections in pediatric medicine: current issues in presentation and treatment.
AB  - Bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. During the initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. Prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. Once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. In children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring inpatient management or urgent operative debridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may have a polymicrobial origin. In choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). Other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. Any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. Oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of S. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). The second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. The third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in the pediatric setting.
TI  - New antimicrobial cystatin C-based peptide active against gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - We describe the synthesis and antibacterial properties of a novel antimicrobial peptidyl derivative, (2S)-2-(Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-leucylamido-1-[(E)-cinnamoylamido]-3-met hylbutane, structurally based upon the inhibitory centre of the human cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. The derivative, here called Cystapep 1, displayed antibacterial activity against several clinically important gram-positive bacteria. It displayed minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 16 microg/ml for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In radial agar diffusion assays, groups A, B, C and G streptococci as well as staphylococci were generally susceptible to the action of Cystapep 1, whereas pneumococci and enterococci were less susceptible. No activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed. Cystapep 1 also showed high activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multiantibiotic-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), suggesting that its mechanism of action differs from those of most currently used antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - Acylation of SC4 dodecapeptide increases bactericidal potency against Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
AB  - We have conjugated dodecyl and octadecyl fatty acids to the N-terminus of SC4, a  potently bactericidal, helix-forming peptide 12-mer (KLFKRHLKWKII), and examined the bactericidal activities of the resultant SC4 'peptide-amphiphile' molecules. SC4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30-fold increase in bactericidal activity against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus anthracis), including S. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Fatty acid conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3- to 6-fold. Although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the haemolytic effects occurred at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. For insight into the mechanism of action of SC4 peptide-amphiphiles, CD, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. CD indicated that SC4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the SC4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of SC4 peptide-amphiphiles. NMR structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. These results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the SC4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin and cefadroxil for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - In this multicenter, investigator-blind trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of azithromycin and cefadroxil for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs). A total of 296 patients were randomized to receive either azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once a day on days 2 to 5) or cefadroxil (500 mg twice a day for 10 days). Outpatients, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years, with acute uncomplicated SSSIs were enrolled in the study. Clinical and bacteriologic response was assessed between days 10 and 13 (primary end point) and between days 28 and 32. In a modified intent-to-treat analysis, clinical success rates assessed between days 10 and 13 were 97% (111/114) for azithromycin and 96% (101/105) for cefadroxil (P = .717). For azithromycin and cefadroxil, corresponding rates of bacteriologic eradication for Staphylococcus aureus were 94% (64/68) and 86% (60/70), respectively, and for Streptococcus pyogenes, 80% (4/5) and 100% (6/6), respectively. Clinical success rates assessed between days 28 and 32 were 100% (82/82) for azithromycin compared with 90% (75/83) for cefadroxil (P = .007). Corresponding rates of eradication for S aureus were 100% (59/59) versus 89% (56/63), respectively; and for S pyogenes, 100% (4/4) versus 83% (5/6), respectively. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was similar in the 2 treatment groups. However, 5 of the 139 patients (4%) in the cefadroxil group discontinued therapy because of treatment-related adverse events compared with none of the 152 patients in the azithromycin group (P = .02). Five-day therapy with azithromycin was as effective as 10-day therapy with cefadroxil for treating uncomplicated SSSIs.
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the USA and Europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in hospitalised patients were studied. Data were reported by clinical laboratories in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and Spain during 2001 which participate in The Surveillance Network (TSN). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. MRSA was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of S. aureus in each country, respectively. The majority of MRSA were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (France) to 15.9% (Italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (France) to 87.0% (Italy) resistant. More than 99.0% of MSSA tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (France) to 94.6% of MSSA (Germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (USA) to 86.6% (Spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (Italy) to 99.2% (France) were gentamicin susceptible. MSSA were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. Overall, 100% of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Macrolide resistance was common among S. agalactiae (20.7%, Germany to 10%, Italy and Spain), S. pyogenes (19.2%, France to 11.1%, USA) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, France to 14.1%, Germany). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside the USA (17.5%) and Italy (7.4%). For all countries susceptibility of E. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in Spain to 94.3% in Germany. Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. Putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in E. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in USA, Italy and Spain and in France and Germany <2%. For P. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. Surveillance data should be considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating SSTI.
TI  - Frequency and clinical role of Staphylococcus aureus overinfection in atopic dermatitis in children.
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the frequency and role of Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). In 81 children, ages 2 months to 9 years, affected with moderate to severe AD, 308 samples from the cutaneous lesions were obtained and analyzed. S. aureus was isolated in 52 children (64.2%). Five of these were also colonized by Streptococcus pyogenes and one by Candida albicans. In 61 patients, total IgE serum level and specific IgE were tested to evaluate their allergic status: in 43 children a diagnosis of extrinsic AD was made, while 18 were affected by intrinsic AD. A higher presence of the bacterium was observed in allergic (71%) versus nonallergic children (49%). Our data demonstrate the importance of S. aureus in the clinical manifestation of AD and, in particular, its role in worsening the eczematous lesions of the face, neck, and perineum in children less than 1 year of age.
TI  - Telithromycin post-antibiotic and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects for 10 Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Post-antibiotic effects (PAE) and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SME) of the ketolide telithromycin (HMR 3647) were determined for 10 Gram-positive cocci with various macrolide resistance mechanisms, including inducible and constitutive ribosomal methylase and macrolide efflux resistance genes. Strains tested included four Streptococcus pneumoniae, three Streptococcus pyogenes and three Staphylococcus aureus. Telithromycin MICs were 0.008-0.015 mg/L for pneumococci, 0.015-4.0 mg/L for S. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/L for staphylococci. PAE were determined after exposure of strains at 10 x MIC for 1 h. PA-SME were determined in the presence of 0.12x, 0.25x and 0.5x MIC of the agent after the initial 1 h exposure period. The PAE of telithromycin varied from 0.3 to 3.8 h; the PA-SME varied from 0.8 to 4.6 h, with maximal PA-SME varying from 1.5 to 4.6 h. PAE tended to be shortest for S. pyogenes (0.4-2.7 h) and S. aureus (0.3-2.4 h), compared to 1.5-3.8 h for S. pneumoniae. The duration of the PA-SME was similar for the three species tested. The low MICs for many strains as well as the PAE and PA-SME demonstrated in this study for telithromycin show promise for increasing the dosing interval of this ketolide, but will need verification by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical studies.
TI  - Comparative activity of garenoxacin and other agents by susceptibility and time-kill testing against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Garenoxacin is a novel des-F(6)quinolone that has shown excellent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of clinically important microorganisms. In this study, its activity was examined, in comparison with that of other antimicrobial agents, by susceptibility and time-kill testing against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Overall, 200 bacterial strains were tested. The antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, erythromycin and clarithromycin. In addition, the bactericidal activity of garenoxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated by time-kill analysis against four strains each of staphylococci [two methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and two methicillin-resistant (MRSA)], pneumococci (two penicillin-susceptible and two penicillin-resistant) and Streptococcus pyogenes (two erythromycin-susceptible and two erythromycin-resistant). Antibiotics were tested at concentrations 1-8 x MIC. RESULTS: MIC90 values of garenoxacin for the MSSA and MRSA strains were 0.03 and 2 mg/L, respectively. Among all the quinolones tested, garenoxacin yielded the lowest MIC values against all pneumococci (MIC90 0.12 mg/L) irrespective of macrolide resistance; the rank order of activity was garenoxacin> moxifloxacin>levofloxacin>ciprofloxacin. Excellent activity was shown also against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 <or= 0.03 mg/L) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 <or= 0.03 mg/L). Ninety percent of S. pyogenes were inhibited at garenoxacin concentrations equal to 0.25 mg/L, its activity not being influenced by macrolide susceptibility. Garenoxacin was rapidly bactericidal against staphylococci, producing a >or= 3 log10 decrease in viable counts (cfu/mL) within 3 h at 4 x MIC, whereas a moderate, slower killing rate was observed versus streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: This investigational des-F(6)quinolone represents a promising alternative for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Secondary infections with beta-hemolytic streptococci in skin lesions.
AB  - Secondary infections (SI) in skin lesions are common. In the present study 40 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 36 patients suffering from SI due to various skin diseases. Staphylococcus aureus coexisted with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 29 of these cases (81%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci were often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-positive rods. Eighteen patients (50%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. In most cases of SI due to atopic dermatitis (AD), the predominant species was S. aureus, while in other skin diseases, S. aureus and beta-haemolytica streptococci were predominant in approximately 50% of the patients, except for SI due to tumors and viral diseases. The mean age of patients with SI and beta-hemolytic streptococci was 37 years and that of patients with SI and predominant S. aureus was 32 years. The lower mean age found for S. aureus was due to SI found in patients with AD. This study emphasizes the polymicrobial microbiology of SI.
TI  - Cutaneous infections in the elderly: diagnosis and management.
AB  - Over the past several years there have been many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous infectious diseases. This review focuses on the three major topics of interest in the geriatric population: herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), onychomycosis, and recent advances in antibacterial therapy. Herpes zoster in adults is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that causes chickenpox in children. For many years acyclovir was the gold standard of antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with herpes zoster. Famciclovir and valacyclovir, newer antivirals for herpes zoster, offer less frequent dosing. PHN refers to pain lasting > or = 2 months after an acute attack of herpes zoster. The pain may be constant or intermittent and may occur spontaneously or be caused by seemingly innocuous stimuli such as a light touch. Treatment of established PHN through pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy will be discussed. In addition, therapeutic strategies to prevent PHN will be reviewed. These include the use of oral corticosteroids, nerve blocks, and treatment with standard antiviral therapy. Onychomycosis, or tinea unguium, is caused by dermatophytes in the majority of cases, but can also be caused by Candida and nondermatophyte molds. Onychomycosis is found more frequently in the elderly and in more males than females. There are four types of onychomycosis: distal subungual onychomycosis, proximal subungual onychomycosis, white superficial onychomycosis, and candidal onychomycosis. Over the past several years, new treatments for this disorder have emerged which offer shorter courses of therapy and greater efficacy than previous therapies. The treatment of bacterial skin and skin structure infections in the elderly is an important issue. There has been an alarming increase in the incidence of gram-positive infections, including resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and drug-resistant pneumococci. While vancomycin has been considered the drug of last defense against gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria, the late 1980s saw an increase in vancomycin-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). More recently, strains of vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA) have been isolated. Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are often the cause of skin and skin structure infections, ranging from mild pyodermas to complicated infections including postsurgical wound infections, severe carbunculosis, and erysipelas. With limited treatment options, it has become critical to identify antibiotics with novel mechanisms of activity. Several new drugs have emerged as possible therapeutic alternatives, including linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - Assessment of Streptococcus pyogenes microcolony formation in infected skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are often simultaneously detected from many cases of non-bullous impetigo with atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVES: Using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), to investigate formation of S. pyogenes microcolonies in skin lesions. METHODS: The S. pyogenes cells in the stationary growth phase alone were strongly stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A (FITC-ConA), and this staining was reduced by pretreatment with amylase. Although the components of sugars in glycocalyx produced by S. pyogenes cells are unknown, we suggested that the materials stained by FITC-ConA were consistent with the presence of ConA-reactive sugars in glycocalyx produced by S. pyogenes cells. RESULTS: S. pyogenes cells associated with streptococcal impetigo skin and croton-oil inflamed mouse skin formed microcolonies encircled by materials (glycocalyx) that stained strongly with FITC-ConA, and these findings were consistent with those in biofilms. In croton-oil inflamed mouse skin, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) infiltrated to just below the epidermis in the cefdinir-treated group but only to the middle dermis in the cefdinir-non-treated group. In this case S. pyogenes and S. aureus cells formed separate microcolonies and existed independently in the outer walls of pustule lesions of streptococcal impetigo. CONCLUSION: In skin infections, S. pyogenes and S. aureus formed aggregates of microcolonies (similar to that in biofilms) encircled by glycocalyx, which can make the infection hard to eradicate using an antimicrobial agent alone. The effect of conventional antimicrobial agents against biofilm is mainly due to the increase of the invasion of PMNs into the biofilm.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes infection induces septic arthritis with increased production of the receptor activator of the NF-kappaB ligand.
AB  - Bacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. We demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of CD-1 mice with the group A streptococcus (GAS) species Streptococcus pyogenes resulted in a high incidence of septic arthritis. Signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and bacterial examinations revealed that colonization of the inoculated GAS in the arthritic joints persisted for 21 days. Induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. Immunohistochemical staining of GAS with anti-GAS antibodies revealed colonization in the joints of infected mice. Cytokine levels were quantified in the joints and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 were detected in the joints from 3 to 20 days after infection. We noted that an increase in the amount of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident in the joints of the infected mice. RANKL was not detected in sera, indicating local production of RANKL in the infected joints. Blocking of RANKL by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor of RANKL, prevented bone destruction in the infected joints. These results suggest that GAS can colonize in the joints and induce bacterial arthritis. Local RANKL production in the infected joints may be involved in bone destruction.
TI  - Inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle pH increase within the physiological range.
AB  - The fibronectin (Fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. Granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized Fn at pH 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher pH 7.4 and almost no binding at pH 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of NaCl (0.15 M). A similar pH-sensitive Fn-binding property was noted with Escherichia coli and Abiotrophia defectiva, but not with Streptococcus pyogenes nor Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the same pH changes. This fastidious pH-dependency of Fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the pH condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.
TI  - Six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. CASES: Five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. The hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. Thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary Medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. OBSERVATIONS: The culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the Medpor implant patient. Culture for the remaining patient was negative . CONCLUSIONS: If there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. Systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. If no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens modulate an apoptosis differentiation program in human neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) are essential to the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens. Recent evidence suggests that PMN apoptosis facilitates resolution of inflammation during bacterial infection. Although progress has been made toward understanding apoptosis in neutrophils, very little is known about transcriptional regulation of this process during bacterial infection. To gain insight into the molecular processes that facilitate resolution of infection, we measured global changes in PMN gene expression during phagocytosis of a diverse group of bacterial pathogens. Genes encoding key effectors of apoptosis were up-regulated, and receptors critical to innate immune function were down-regulated during apoptosis induced by phagocytosis of Burkholderia cepacia, Borrelia hermsii, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Importantly, we identified genes that comprise a common apoptosis differentiation program in human PMNs after phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, phagocytosis of Str. pyogenes induced changes in neutrophil gene expression not observed with other pathogens tested, including down-regulation of 21 genes involved in responses to IFN. Compared with other bacteria, PMN apoptosis was significantly accelerated by Str. pyogenes and was followed by necrosis. Thus, we hypothesize that there are two fundamental outcomes for the interaction of bacterial pathogens with neutrophils: (i) phagocytosis of bacteria induces an apoptosis differentiation program in human PMNs that contributes to resolution of bacterial infection, or (ii) phagocytosis of microorganisms such as Str. pyogenes alters the apoptosis differentiation program in neutrophils, resulting in pathogen survival and disease.
TI  - Many chemokines including CCL20/MIP-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor CCR6 with the CC chemokine ligand CCL20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha). Structural analysis of CCL20/MIP-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. Here, we report that similar to defensins, CCL20/MIP-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Additionally, by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17 human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. Collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. Comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of 4903 bacterial isolates to gemifloxacin--an advanced fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MIC90 values for gemifloxacin were: S. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; Haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; Enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; Neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. The MIC90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the other quinolones tested against S. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). This study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against Gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, Gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative infections.

TI  - Comparative activity of telithromycin against typical community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Major bacterial pathogens in RTIs, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, have exhibited increasing resistance to a variety of antibiotics during the past decades. Telithromycin, the first ketolide, was designed especially to overcome this resistance. The present study was conducted to assess the comparative activity of telithromycin against typical RTI pathogens in Austria. METHODS: A total of 1,015 bacterial isolates was tested, including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. MICs of the following antimicrobials: penicillin G, ampicillin (for H. influenzae), azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A and telithromycin were determined using the NCCLS broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Telithromycin showed excellent activity against S. pneumoniae, with 99.8% of all isolates being susceptible. Penicillin remained active with an MIC50 and MIC90 of 0.007 mg/L. Nevertheless, a notable increase in penicillin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates, from 4.9% in 1996 to the present rate of 10%, was observed. There was also a distinct rise in the resistance levels of S. pneumoniae against the macrolides. All tested isolates of S. pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and telithromycin, and only low levels of resistance against telithromycin were found in S. aureus (2.2%, MIC90 of 0.5 mg/L). No telithromycin-resistant isolate of H. influenzae could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the rising prevalence of resistance among S. pneumoniae not only to penicillin but also to other antimicrobials. It also shows the value of telithromycin as an attractive option for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs in an era of widespread antibacterial resistance.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Bacterial skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) are among the most frequently seen infectious entities in the community setting and occasionally in the institutional setting. A wide variety of SSSIs exist, with cellulitis, impetigo and folliculitis being the most common. Most SSSIs are caused by aerobic staphylococci and streptococci, with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes being involved in more complicated infections. Systemic therapy with a variety of beta-lactams, macrolides and lincosamides (clindamycin) have been the cornerstone of SSSI therapy for many years. With the exception of mupirocin, topical therapy occupies a small therapeutic niche. Despite the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among the pathogens most commonly associated with SSSIs (for example, Streptococcus pyogenes and macrolides; Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and mupirocin), few treatment failures have been reported. The newest antimicrobials reviewed herein (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin) are not a significant improvement upon older agents in the treatment of SSSIs. Perhaps this assessment will change if the penetrance of the antimicrobial resistance patterns described above reach a critical threshold and clinical failures become more widespread.
TI  - Epidemiology and virulence gene expression of intracellular group A streptococci  in tonsils of recurrently infected adults.
AB  - Intracellularly persistent group A streptococci (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) have been associated with recurrent tonsillopharyngitis and antibiotic treatment failure. As a supplementation of the published in vitro data, conventional bacteriology and molecular epidemiology was performed on material from 29 adult patients of a German army hospital with anamnestic signs of recurrent tonsillopharyngitis. Pre-surgery tonsil swabs and the surgically removed tonsils were examined with respect to growth of aerobic bacteria in absence and presence of antibiotics with exclusively extracellular activity. Under such antibiotic selection, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS were cultured from specimens of 13 and 3 patients, respectively. In every material GAS-positive by culture methods, the intracellular location of the penicillin-susceptible GAS isolates was confirmed by immunohistologic examination of tonsillar sections using a GAS-specific IgG antibody. The three intracellular GAS isolates were typed by emm gene sequencing and could be associated to types M6 and M49 (two isolates). The bacteria were serially passaged on sheep blood agar, and semiquantitative mRNA analysis from virulence genes was performed using bacteria of the 4th and 25th passage after isolation. An M-type-specific pattern of virulence gene expression and different gene expression levels in relation to the passage number were observed.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little attention has been given to acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS), although up to 10% of cases are caused by this microorganism. The objective of this study was to define the clinical and laboratory characteristics of AHO caused by GABHS. METHODS: Between January 1983 and June 1999, 29 patients were treated at Children's National Medical Center with AHO caused by GABHS. The characteristics of these patients were compared with those of 28 patients with AHO caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and those of a matched sample of 45 patients with AHO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Median ages of children with GABHS, S pneumoniae, and S aureus AHO were 36.0, 13.7, and 96.0 months, respectively. On admission, patients with GABHS AHO had a mean temperature of 38.9 +/- 1.3 degrees C and a mean white blood cell count of 17 000 +/- 7800/mm3, findings similar to those from patients with S pneumoniae AHO. Patients with S aureus AHO had significantly lower admission temperature (38.1 +/- 1.1 degrees C) and white blood cell count (10 600 +/- 4900/mm3). Varicella infection was the risk factor in 5 cases (17%) of GABHS AHO, whereas none of the cases of AHO caused by S pneumoniae and S aureus was associated with varicella infection. Adjacent septic arthritis occurred in 22%, 28%, and 61% of children with GABHS, S aureus, and S pneumoniae AHO, respectively. Admission erythrocyte sedimentation rate and frequency of bacteremia were similar in all groups. However, time to normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate was longer for GABHS and S aureus than for S pneumoniae AHO. GABHS, like S pneumoniae, affected fewer nonextremity bones compared with S aureus. CONCLUSIONS: GABHS should be considered in preschool- and early school-aged children who are suspected of having AHO and whose clinical and laboratory features are characterized by high fever and marked leukocytosis. It should also be highly considered in any child with AHO associated with varicella infection.
TI  - [Infections caused by piercing and tattoos--a review].
AB  - Piercing, i.e. perforation of skin or mucous membranes in order to attach mostly  metallic jewelery as well as multicolored skin tattooing have become more popular than ever before and a considerable number of (young) people practise these methods of body art which are supposed to increase the individuality. But there is a lot of side effects, among them especially infections. The most important bacteria cultivated from such patients are Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses which can be transmitted by piercing or tattooing are especially hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Besides local bacterial infections also systemic infections (sepsis, endocarditis) occur. The main aspects of diagnostics, therapy and prevention are discussed.
TI  - Novel 12-membered ring macrolides with activity against erythromycin-resistant organisms.
AB  - A series of novel 12-membered ring macrolides was designed based on available information on structure-activity relationships and macrolide-ribosome interactions. Compounds with the desosamine and the anchor group properly attached to the 12-membered lactone ring exhibited improved activity against erythromycin-resistant organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens recovered from patients in Latin America: results from the PROTEKT surveillance study (1999-2000).
AB  - PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) is a global surveillance study established in 1999 to monitor antibacterial resistance of respiratory tract organisms. Thirteen centers from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico participated during 1999-2000; they collected 1806 isolates (Streptococcus pneumoniae 518, Haemophilus influenzae 520, Moraxella catarrhalis 140, Staphylococcus aureus 351, S. pyogenes 277). Overall, 218 (42.1%) of the S. pneumoniae isolates had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 79 (15.3%) were penicillin-resistant and 79 (15.3%) were erythromycin-resistant. Mexico had the highest prevalence of penicillin (76.5%) and erythromycin (31.2%) resistance. Of 77 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae tested for resistance genotype, 43 possessed mef(A), 33 possessed erm(B) and 1 possessed both erm(B) and mef(A) mechanism. All S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to telithromycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. Among H. influenzae isolates, 88 (16.9%) produced beta-lactamase, ranging from 11% (Brazil) to 24.5% (Mexico). Among M. catarrhalis isolates, 138 (98.6%) produced beta-lactamase. Twenty-four (8.7%) of the S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant; resistance being attributable to mefA (n=18), ermTR (n=5) and ermB (n=1). All H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pyogenes were fully susceptible to telithromycin. Methicillin resistance was found in 26.5% of the S. aureus isolates (Argentina 15%; Mexico 20%; Brazil 31.3%). Telithromycin was effective against 97.7% of methicillin-susceptible isolates. PROTEKT confirms that antibacterial resistance is an emerging problem in Latin America. The previously reported high levels of pneumococcal resistance to the beta-lactam and macrolides were exceeded. New agents that do not induce resistance or that exert low selective pressure, e.g. telithromycin, are essential to safeguard future antibacterial efficacy.
TI  - Incidence and etiologies of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children, 1996 to 2001.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence and causative organisms associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia are likely to have changed during the past several years. METHODS: Data regarding clinical and laboratory features were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of 76 subjects with complicated parapneumonic effusions at a tertiary children's hospital from 1996 through 2001. Incidence rates per 10 000 hospital discharges and per 1000 patients with nonviral pneumonia were calculated. RESULTS: Etiologic organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 subjects), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (5), Abiotrophia sp. (1) and no culture-confirmed agent (32). The annual incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions per 10 000 discharges progressively increased from 4.5 in 1996 to 25.0 in 1999 (P = 0.0001), then declined to 10.1 in 2001 (P = 0.03). Similarly the incidence per 1000 cases of nonviral pneumonia increased from 2.9 in 1996 to 11.0 in 1999 (P = 0.003) and then declined to 4.8 in 2001 (P = 0.053). Whereas S. pneumoniae was the leading confirmed etiology in each year, the proportion of cases caused by Staphylococcus aureus increased from 6% in 1996 to 2000 (all of which were methicillin-susceptible) to 30% in 2001 (all methicillin-resistant; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia increased from 1996 to 1999 and then declined concomitant with the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Although cases caused by S. pneumoniae have decreased, community onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with complicated effusions in children.
TI  - Bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis compared with bacteremic cellulitis caused by  Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - In order to better characterize bacteremic cellulitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a review was conducted of 10 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis, which represented 0.9% of all cases of pneumococcal bacteremia (n=1,076) and 3.2% of all cases of community-acquired bacteremic cellulitis (n=312) that occurred in the Hospital de Bellvitge, Barcelona, from 1984 to 2001. In addition to these 10 cases, 28 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis from the literature (Medline 1975-2001) were reviewed. Pneumococcal cellulitis of the face, neck, and trunk was observed more frequently in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and hematologic disorders, while pneumococcal cellulitis of the limbs was more common in patients with diabetes, alcoholism, and parenteral drug use. In the Hospital de Bellvitge group, bacteremic cellulitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae was more frequently associated with severe underlying diseases than that due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes (100%, 57%, and 72%, respectively;P=0.01). A concomitant extracutaneous focus of infection (e.g., respiratory tract infection) suggesting hematogenous spread with metastatic cellulitis was more frequent in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, while a local cutaneous entry of microorganisms was feasible in most patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis. The 30-day mortality was 10% in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, 13% in patients with Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and 23% in patients with Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis (P=0.3). Thus, bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis is an unusual manifestation of pneumococcal disease and occurs mainly in patients with severe underlying diseases. In most cases, pneumococcal cellulitis has a different pathophysiologic mechanism than cellulitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Amoxicillin-sulbactam: A clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  - Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. This means that they are an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. The amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against Gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), Gram-negative cocci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and others), Gram-negative bacilli (nonhospital strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. Its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis). It is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. It is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. The new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. In summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
TI  - [Contribution of linezolid to the treatment of complicated infections of the skin and soft tissues].
AB  - THREE GROUPS OF INCREASING SEVERITY: According to the 2000 consensus conference,  bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues can be classified in three categories of increasing severity: bacterial dermo-hypodermal infections, bacterial dermo-hypodermal necrotizing infections, necrotizing fasciitis. The last two categories are medicosurgical emergency conditions requiring repeated surgical debridement and probabilistic antibiotic therapy. LINEZOLID: The clinical efficacy of linezolid in bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues is comparable to that of oxacillin/dicloxacillin. Several arguments (frequent implication of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, well-adapted spectrum, changing resistance pattern of Gram-positive cocci, efficacy against associated bacteriemia, favorable kinetics and diffusion data in cutaneous tissues) argue in favor of the use of linezolid in infections of the skin and soft tissues
TI  - Targeting bacterial virulence: the role of protein synthesis inhibitors in severe infections. Insights from the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists.
AB  - Morbidity and mortality due to certain bacterial pathogens have not declined despite the availability of effective antimicrobial treatments. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause a number of serious infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome, which are associated with the release of bacterial toxins. Animal studies have demonstrated clindamycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, to be more effective in treating these severe infections than other more susceptible antimicrobial treatments. Linezolid, another protein synthesis inhibitor, also has shown efficacy in in vitro studies. Human trials to validate the effects of antibiotic therapies on bacterial virulence have not been performed. Future animal and human studies are needed to help elucidate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of protein synthesis inhibitors in order to optimize antimicrobial treatment and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Pathogenic bacteria attach to human fibronectin through a tandem beta-zipper.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, two important human pathogens,  target host fibronectin (Fn) in their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have multiple Fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein. The bacterium-binding site in the amino-terminal domain (1-5F1) of Fn contains five sequential Fn type 1 (F1) modules. Here we show the structure of a streptococcal (S. dysgalactiae) FnBP peptide (B3) in complex with the module pair 1F12F1. This identifies 1F1- and 2F1-binding motifs in B3 that form additional antiparallel beta-strands on sequential F1 modules-the first example of a tandem beta-zipper. Sequence analyses of larger regions of FnBPs from S. pyogenes and S. aureus reveal a repeating pattern of F1-binding motifs that match the pattern of F1 modules in 1-5F1 of Fn. In the process of Fn-mediated invasion of host cells, therefore, the bacterial proteins seem to exploit the modular structure of Fn by forming extended tandem beta-zippers. This work is a vital step forward in explaining the full mechanism of the integrin-dependent FnBP-mediated invasion of host cells.

TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens in North America in 1999-2000: findings of the PROTEKT surveillance study.
AB  - The PROTEKT surveillance study commenced in 1999 to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory pathogens. We report here the results from 2371 isolates collected during 2000 by North American centers (Canada, n = 7; USA, n = 8). Overall, 21.3% of pneumococci (n = 687) were penicillin G-resistant (Canada, 10.3%; USA, 32.6%). Corresponding rates of erythromycin resistance were 16.3% and 31.5%. Telithromycin inhibited all penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant isolates at < or =1 microg/ml. Among 612 Hemophilus influenzae isolates, 22.4% were beta-lactamase-positive. Antimicrobial susceptibility of H. influenzae varied between 82.4% (clarithromycin) and 100% (cefpodoxime, levofloxacin). Importantly, one isolate was found to be resistant to both moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Most Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobials tested, except ampicillin. All Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 382) were penicillin-susceptible and 5.2% were non-susceptible to erythromycin. S. pyogenes showed cross-resistance to other macrolides yet remained inhibited by telithromycin at < or =0.5 microg/ml. Methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus was common (19.9%), particularly in the USA. The PROTEKT study confirms the widespread prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens in North America, and hence the need for continued surveillance to guide optimal empiric therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Resistance pattern of bacteria isolated from acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) cases.
AB  - Out of 350 acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) patients 110 (31.4%) were positive on culture. Among then (35.5%) yielded from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and 64.5% yielded from lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Predominant bacterial isolates from URI were Staph aureus (12.4%) and Strepto. pyogen (9.8%) whereas predominant agent from LRI were Strepto. pneumoniae (14.7%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%). Capsular typing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and type specific antisera revealed that 64.7% of the isolates were type-b and rest were non-b. The most frequent resistance pattern of H. influenzae was found resistant to penicillin-ampicillin (64.7%) followed by SMX-TMP (14.7%) and tetracycline (5.9%). Among penicillin-ampicillin resistant strains, 81.8% were beta lectamase positive and 18.2% were beta lectamase negative. Among beta lectamase positive strains 66.7% were capsular type-b and 33.3% were non-b, had MICS < or = 8 microgram/ml. and < or = 4 microgram/ml. respectively. 5.9% strains of Strepto. pneumoniae was found resistant to SMX-TMP, 5.9% to penicillin-ampicillin and 2.9% to cephalexin. Common resistance pattern of Staph aureus was penicillin-ampicillin (60%), SMX-TMP (37.2%) and tetracycline-erythromycine-cephalexin (11.4%). Strepto. pyogen was found resistant to tetracycline in 12.2% cases and to SMX-TMP in 8.3% cases.
TI  - [Some features of tonsillar microflora and microbial interaction (in normal and pathological states)].
AB  - The description of a new method for the determination of interaction between bacterial strains isolated from the mucous membrane of tonsils of healthy children and patients with chronic tonsillitis. In the analysis of mutual influence of symbionts on the hemolytic, lecitovitellase, lysozyme and antilysozyme activity of microbes isolated from healthy children no changes in the expression of these pathogenicity and persistence factors have been detected in the overwhelming majority of cases (70.8-89.9%). In the microflora of sick children interactions were synergic with respect to pathogenicity factors in 35.2-46.7% of cases and antagonistic in 18.7-31.3% of cases.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on the oropharyngeal flora in patients with acne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and resistance patterns of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in the oropharynx of individuals with acne who were using or not using antibiotic therapy. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Dermatology Department of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. PATIENTS: Patients with acne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of S pyogenes and S aureus in the oropharynx as determined by culture and their resistance patterns to tetracycline antibiotics as determined by agar disk diffusion. RESULTS: Of 105 patients who participated, 42 were using oral or topical antibiotics and 63 patients were not using antibiotics. Six (10%) of those 63 not using any antibiotics had positive S pyogenes cultures compared with 13 (33%) of those successfully evaluated using antibiotics (n = 39) (prevalence risk ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-8.6; P=.003). A total of 85% of S pyogenes cultures (11/13) from those using antibiotics were resistant to at least 1 tetracycline antibiotic compared with 20% (1/5) from those not using antibiotics (P=.01). Of those not using antibiotics, 29% (18/62) had positive S aureus cultures compared with 22% (9/41) of those using antibiotics (prevalence risk ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-1.5; P=.42). No significant differences in resistance patterns of S aureus were found. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pyogenes colonization and resistance in the oropharynx are associated with antibiotic therapy in patients with acne. The clinical and long-term effects of this finding need to be studied further.
TI  - Colonization of burn wounds in Ain Shams University Burn Unit.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit, Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. Throughout the study period starting from 1 June 1999 till 31 May 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. A total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. Eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of Candida (C. albicans) were detected. There was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then Escherichia coli (13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (11.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), Enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). Studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). During the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). Burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). As for Candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Adhesive surface proteins of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bind to polystyrene, fibronectin, and type I and IV collagens.
AB  - Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive bacterium that causes erysipelas  in animals and erysipeloid in humans. We found two adhesive surface proteins of E. rhusiopathiae and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genes, which were colocalized and designated rspA and rspB. The two genes were present in all of the serovars of E. rhusiopathiae strains examined. The deduced RspA and RspB proteins contain the C-terminal anchoring motif, LPXTG, which is preceded by repeats of consensus amino acid sequences. The consensus sequences are composed of 78 to 92 amino acids and repeat 16 and 3 times in RspA and RspB, respectively. Adhesive surface proteins of other gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes adhesin-like protein, Streptococcus pyogenes protein F2 and F2-like protein, Streptococcus dysgalactiae FnBB, and Staphylococcus aureus Cna, share the same consensus repeats. Furthermore, the N-terminal regions of RspA and RspB showed characteristics of the collagen-binding domain that was described for Cna. RspA and RspB were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged fusion proteins and purified. The recombinant proteins showed a high degree of capacity to bind to polystyrene and inhibited the binding of E. rhusiopathiae onto the abiotic surface in a dose dependent manner. In a solid-phase binding assay, both of the recombinant proteins bound to fibronectin, type I and IV collagens, indicating broad spectrum of their binding ability. It was suggested that both RspA and RspB were exposed on the cell surface of E. rhusiopathiae, as were the bacterial cells agglutinated by the anti-RspA immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-RspB IgG. RspA and RspB were present both in surface-antigen extracts and the culture supernatants of E. rhusiopathiae Fujisawa-SmR (serovar 1a) and SE-9 (serovar 2). The recombinant RspA, but not RspB, elicited protection in mice against experimental challenge. These results suggest that RspA and RspB participate in initiation of biofilm formation through their binding abilities to abiotic and biotic surfaces.
TI  - [Cellulitis and soft tissue infection in patients with HIV disease: epidemiological and microbiological features].
AB  - In order to assess the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of cellulitis and soft tissue infection occurring during the course of HIV disease, clinical and laboratory data of 2221 hospitalizations carried out since 1991 were retrospectively examined, and 67 bacteriologically-proven episodes of cellulitis-soft tissue infection were identified (3.02% of overall admissions). Among the 92 cultured pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent (46 cases), followed by Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pyogenes; 38.1% of patients had a polymicrobial infection. i.v. drug use (p<.02) and the male gender (p<.05), were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, while a great variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown. An elevated rate (83.6%) of episodes of cellulitis or soft tissue infection were community-acquired in origin; the comprehensive frequency of these episodes significantly dropped during the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (p<.01). Limbs were involved in over 80% of episodes, and an hematogenous dissemination of bacterial infection (which occurred in 25.4% of cases), proved significantly related to a CD4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/microL (p<.03), and an absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/microL (p<.05). S. aureus strains showed an elevated in vitro resistance rate to penicillin, ampicillin, and rifampin, and a 21.7% rate of methicillin-resistance, while among the 29 gram-negative microorganisms, resistance to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins, and that to amoxycillin-clavulanate and second-generation cephalosporin, occurred in over 90% and 60% of tested strains, respectively. All episodes of HIV-associated cellulitis and soft tissue infection were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis occurred in 4 patients only, 6-17 months after the initial episode. Cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of HIV disease, but they have a broad etiological and clinical spectrum, are predominantly community-acquired, and are responsible for an appreciable morbidity, due to the supporting role of i.v. drug addiction, and the frequent hematogenous dissemination (which proved to be significantly related to the progression of immunodeficiency and underlying disease). The frequent polymicrobial etiology requires a combination antimicrobial therapy (to be guided by in vitro susceptibility studies), which may avoid a complicated and recurrent disease course in the great majority of cases.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Susceptibility of skin and soft-tissue isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to topical antibiotics: indications of clonal spread of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (SA) isolates (n = 255) from outpatients with skin and soft-tissue infections were collected in 3 different areas in Norway. Group A streptococci (GAS, n = 68) were isolated from skin or pharyngotonsillar specimens from outpatients. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of bacitracin, fusidic acid and mupirocin were tested using the E-test. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of fusidic acid-sensitive (FusS) and -resistant (FusR) SA were compared. All GAS isolates showed MIC of bacitracin of < or = 1.0 mg/l, of mupirocin of < or = 0.125 mg/l and of fusidic acid 1.0-4.0 mg/l. All the SA showed MIC of mupirocin < or = 0.5 mg/l and of bacitracin of > or = 2.0 mg/l, 91% with MIC > or = 16 mg/l. FusR was shown by 32.5% of the SA strains with similar prevalence rates in 3 different geographical areas of Norway. One particular PFGE pattern (type 1) was shown by 76% of the FusR SA. SA of type 1 belonged to phage group II and produced exfoliative toxins. Thus, the results demonstrated a high prevalence of FusR among SA causing skin infections and that this was mainly due to dissemination of clonally related FusR SA.
TI  - Linezolid versus cefadroxil in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin and skin structure infections are common reasons for visits to pediatricians, accounting for up to 18%. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the most frequently isolated Gram-positive pathogens in uncomplicated skin infections. Increasingly outpatient infections involve antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus. METHODS: This randomized, blinded, comparator-controlled, multinational trial compared the efficacy and safety of linezolid and cefadroxil for treatment of uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections in pediatric patients. Children ages 5 to 11 years were to receive linezolid suspension [10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg)] or cefadroxil suspension [15 mg/kg (up to 500 mg)] every 12 h. Patients ages 12 to 17 years were to receive linezolid tablets (600 mg) or cefadroxil capsules (500 mg) every 12 h. Therapy lasted 10 to 21 consecutive days with a follow-up visit 10 to 21 days posttherapy. RESULTS: Linezolid and cefadroxil were consistently effective treatments across all primary and secondary efficacy assessments. At follow-up cure rates were 88.7% (205 of 231) for linezolid-treated and 86.2% (193 of 224) for cefadroxil-treated intent-to-treat patients; cure rates were 91.0% (201 of 221) for linezolid-treated and 90.0% (189 of 210) for cefadroxil-treated clinically evaluable patients. S. aureus was eradicated in 89.6% (120 of 134) linezolid-treated and 88.8% (111 of 125) cefadroxil-treated microbiologically evaluable patients. Gastrointestinal complaints were the most common adverse events reported, without significant differences between treatment groups, and myelosuppression was not observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid is well-tolerated and as effective as cefadroxil in treating uncomplicated skin infections in pediatric patients. Linezolid effectively treated infections caused by S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Current status of bacterial resistance in the otolaryngology field: results from  the Second Nationwide Survey in Japan.
AB  - The study reported here was a nationwide assessment of otitis media (466 patients with acute suppurative otitis media and 476 with chronic suppurative otitis media), sinusitis (447 with acute sinusitis and 426 with chronic sinusitis), acute tonsillitis (724 patients), and peritonsillar abscess (141 patients) performed between November 1998 and March 1999. Eighty university hospitals, 79 affiliated hospitals, and 103 general practitioners participated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) comprised 15.6% of the 786 isolated strains of S. aureus. MRSA was frequently detected in patients with suppurative otitis media, but was uncommon in those with acute tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess, and it was more common in those who had already been treated than in those who had not, with a significant difference between the groups. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest antimicrobial activity against MRSA and no VCM resistance was detected. Penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae(PSSP), penicillin-intermediate-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 49.6%, 28.5%, and 21.9% of the 228 isolated strains of S. pneumoniae, respectively. PISP and PRSP were frequently detected in children aged 5 years or younger. beta-Lactamase was produced by 96 of the 100 strains (96%) of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The 281 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated consisted of 199 beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-sensitive (BLNASe) strains (70.8%), 65 beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains (23.1%), and 17 beta-lactamase-producing strains (6.0%). BLNAR strains were frequently detected in pretreated patients. Of these 281 strains of H. influenzae, 214 had nontypable capsules. In conclusion, the major bacterial species showed resistance to beta-lactams, indicating that care should be taken when selecting an appropriate antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Target site penetration of fosfomycin in critically ill patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate the target site penetration properties of fosfomycin, an antibiotic particularly suitable for treatment of soft tissue infections (STIs) in critically ill patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included nine patients with sepsis. Penetration of fosfomycin into the interstitial space fluid of skeletal muscle was measured using the microdialysis technique, following a single intravenous administration of 8.0 g of fosfomycin to patients. The median (range) fosfomycin area under the concentration versus time profile for plasma and skeletal muscle were 673 (459-1108) and 477 (226-860) mg x h/L (P < 0.011), respectively. Interstitial maximum concentrations were lower than plasma values (P < 0.029). Median fosfomycin concentrations in the interstitium and plasma exceeded 70 mg/L throughout the observation period of 4 h and covered MICs for Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Simulation of bacterial growth inhibition of S. pyogenes, based on tissue concentration data, confirmed the bactericidal properties of fosfomycin described in previous studies. CONCLUSION: Fosfomycin concentrations in muscle interstitium and plasma exceeded the MICs for a range of clinically relevant pathogens in critically ill patients. Thus, fosfomycin exhibits a tissue pharmacokinetic profile, which appears to offer an alternative to other broad-spectrum antibiotics in intensive care patients suffering from STI.
TI  - Benzo[f]naphtyridones: a new family of topical antibacterial agents active on multi-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of benzo[f][1,7]naphtyridone derivatives are reported. These compounds are potent antibacterial agents with a Gram-positive spectrum of activity. They are active against multi-resistant cocci, especially Staphylococcus aureus strains. Their physico-chemical and biological properties make them particularly suitable for topical antibacterial use.
TI  - Factors associated with complications and mortality in adult patients hospitalized for infectious cellulitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze medical outcomes, including risks for complications and mortality, in 332 adult patients hospitalized for cellulitis. The infection was documented microbiologically in 128 cases (39%). Staphylococcus aureus (46 cases) and Streptococcus pyogenes (22 cases) were the most frequent causative pathogens. Overall, 63 patients (19%) were discharged early (< or =4 days) and 166 patients (50%) were hospitalized for more than 4 days without developing any complications. One hundred three patients (31%) had one or more complications or died. Of these, 78 required surgical debridement, 10 required plastic surgery, 7 underwent amputation, and 15 had shock on presentation. When comparing the three study groups (patients discharged early, patients hospitalized for < or =4 days without complications, and patients who developed 1 or more complication or who died), patients who were discharged early (low risk) were more frequently female and were less likely to have multiple comorbid conditions, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, and/or cutaneous necrosis at presentation. Overall mortality (<30 days) was 5% (16/332 patients). Factors associated with death were male sex, presence of multiple comorbid conditions, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, shock, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cellulitis. These findings can be used to stratify patients with acute cellulitis according to risks for complications and mortality and may be helpful when deciding the most appropriate means of care, i.e. outpatient treatment or hospitalization.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children.
AB  - Little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. Increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in South Africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the United States. This study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in South African children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. Middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. While 92 per cent of the children had recently received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (nine), Staphylococcus aureus (six), Moraxella catarrhalis (two), Streptococcus pyogenes (two) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). Two isolates were identified in each of eight children. Antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35 (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. The pneumococcal serotypes found were 19F (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23F (23 per cent), 6B (nine per cent), 19A (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). Children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months) than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). Isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (OR = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (OR = 7.72, p = 0.03). Almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.
TI  - Primary bacterial pyomyositis associated with septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes: a case report.
AB  - Pyomyositis is relatively rare in temperate climates. This is the first report of a case of calf pyomyositis associated with septic arthritis of the knee. This case illustrates that pyomyositis should be included in the differential diagnosis of a swollen, tender calf in an emergency setting. The other notable feature of this case is that the infective organism was not the usual Staphylococcus aureus but rather the relatively rarely involved Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a new ligand-binding site in FnbB, a fibronectin-binding adhesin from Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae S2, a bovine mastitis isolate, expresses the fibronectin (Fn)-binding adhesin FnbB. Here, we describe a new fibronectin-binding domain called UFnBD, located 100 amino acid N-terminal to the primary repetitive Fn-binding domain (FnBRD-B) of FnbB. UFnBD interacted with N-terminal region of Fn (N29) and this binding was mostly mediated by type I module pair 2-3 of N29 fragment, whereas FnBRD-B mainly bound to type I module pair 4-5. Furthermore, UFnBD inhibited adherence of S. dysgalactiae to Fn but at lower level as compared to FnBRD-B. UFnBD exclusively shared antigenic properties with the Fn-binding unit Du of FnbpA from Staphylococcus aureus but not with ligand-binding domains or motifs of other adhesins, while Fn-induced determinants of FnBRD-B and other adhesins appeared to be conformationally related. Consistent with this, a monoclonal antibody 7E11 generated from a mouse immunized with FnbB, and that recognized UFnBD did not cross-react with FnBRD-B. The epitope for 7E11 was mapped to 40 amino acid long segment within UFnBD and interaction between the antibody and the epitope was specifically induced by Fn or N29. A similar antibody epitope was observed in Streptococcus pyogenes strains suggesting the presence of an adhesin bearing epitope related to FnbB.
TI  - Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens: molecular, biological and clinical aspects.
AB  - Superantigens (SAgs) include a class of certain bacterial and viral proteins exhibiting highly potent lymphocyte-transforming (mitogenic) activity towards human and or other mammalian T lymphocytes. Unlike conventional antigens, SAgs bind to certain regions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) outside the classical antigen-binding groove and concomitantly bind in their native form to T cells at specific motifs of the variable region of the beta chain (Vbeta) of the T cell receptor (TcR). This interaction triggers the activation (proliferation) of the targeted T lymphocytes and leads to the in vivo or in vitro release of high amounts of various cytokines and other effectors by immune cells. Each SAg interacts specifically with a characteristic set of Vbeta motifs. The review summarizes our current knowledge on S. aureus and S. pyogenes superantigen proteins. The repertoire of the staphylococcal and streptococcal SAgs comprises 24 and 8 proteins, respectively. The staphylococcal SAgs include (i) the classical enterotoxins A, B, C (and antigenic variants), D, E, and the recently discovered enterotoxins G to Q, (ii) toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, (iii) exfoliatins A and B. The streptococcal SAgs include the classical pyrogenic exotoxins A and C and the newly identified pyrogenic toxins, G, H, I, J, SMEZ, and SSA. The structural and genomic aspects of these toxins and their molecular relatedness are described as well as the available 3-D crystal structure of some of them and that of certain of their complexes with MHC class II molecules and the TcR, respectively. The pathophysiological properties and clinical disorders related to these SAgs are reviewed.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in children: Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a leading pathogen.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute mastoiditis is a serious bacterial infection of the temporal bone and is the most common complication of otitis media. The goal of this study is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, management, and outcome of acute mastoiditis in children in northern Israel. METHODS: A systematic review of medical records of all children who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from January 1990 through December 2000. RESULTS: Fifty-seven children were included. Median was age: 36 months. In 26 patients (45.6%) mastoiditis complicated the first episode of acute otitis media (AOM). Twenty-five children (44%) received antibiotic treatment prior to admission. Frequent symptoms included mastoid area erythema in 54 children (94.7%), proptosis of the auricle in 52 children (91.2%) and fever in 43 children (75.4%). Middle ear, and subperiostal culture yielded growth of pathogen in 30 children (75%), two cultures yielded more then one pathogen. The most frequent pathogens were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 children (25%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in eight children (20%), Group A streptococcus in six children (15%). The highest incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in children who did not suffer from AOM before admission (35 vs. 5%). Fifty-two (91.2%) children were cured with antibiotic treatment alone. Seventeen children underwent computed tomography (CT) of the mastoid. Mastoid bone destruction was demonstrated in six children and subperiostal abscess in eight. Mastoidectomy was performed in five children. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of acute mastoiditis can be made on clinical basis alone requiring CT only when complications are suspected. Half of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis had no previous history of recurrent AOM. In those children S. pneumoniae was the leading pathogen while P. aeruginosa was more prevalent in children with recurrent AOM. Most of the children recovered with medical therapy alone, without surgical intervention.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome caused by pyogenic bacteria].
AB  - Case reports and review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Severe toxic shock syndrome caused by invasive infection with pyogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus pyogenes, with high mortality rates in cases of the latter, remained one of the most problematic chapters of critical care medicine to date. AIMS: To give an overview on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, the complex therapeutical approaches of the syndrome and, on the role and mechanisms of action of bacterial superantigens in the pathophysiological processes as well. METHODS AND RESULTS: Literary data, and some illustrative selected cases demonstrate that, the incidence of TSS shows increasing tendency worldwide and, that otherwise healthy, younger people are the most frequently affected. As for prognosis: early diagnosis and treatment with sufficient radicality are of decisive importance.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Zingiber officinale and Garcinia kola on respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity of Zingiber officinale (ginger) Garcinia kola (bitter kola) on four respiratory tract pathogens. DESIGN: A prospective study based on laboratory investigations. SETTING: Department of Life Sciences, University of Buea. Throat swabs were collected from 333 individuals with running nostrils, cough and/or catarrh in three localities of Buea namely Bokwango, Molyko and Bolifamba. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from the specimens using standard microbiological procedures. The antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts of ginger and bitter kola, were investigated on these pathogens using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays. RESULTS: The extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against the pathogens. The MIC of extracts ranged from 0.0003 microg/ml to 0.7 microg/ml for ginger and 0.00008 microg/ml, to 1.8 microg/mL for bitter kola, while MBC ranged from 0.1.35 microg/ml to 2.04 microg/ml for ginger and 0.135 microg/ml to 4.2 microg/ml for bitter kola. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that extracts of ginger root and bitter kola may contain compounds with therapeutic activity.
TI  - Evaluation of the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities of the medicinal plants Dodonaea viscosa, Rumex nervosus and Rumex abyssinicus.
AB  - The crude extracts of the leaves of Dodonaea viscosa and Rumex nervosus as well as of the root of Rumex abyssinicus were tested for anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities. It was observed that the three plants possess antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and strong activity against Coxsackie virus B3 and influenza A virus. In contrast, none of them exhibited anti-fungal activity. The anti-inflammatory activity test results verified that only R. abyssinicus inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E(2).
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Oral streptogramins in the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in debilitated patients are difficult to treat. We studied the clinical efficacy and safety of an oral streptogramin, pristinamycin, for these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were admitted consecutively to receive pristinamycin, usually with doxycycline, for 7-21 days. Fifty-six patients (average age 75 years) from hospital and community were treated for skin, soft tissue, chest and other infections. RESULTS: The overall clinical response rate was 39 of 53 patients (74%; 95% CI: 60%, 85%) cured or substantially improved, from 53 of 56 (95%) patients clinically and 49 of 56 (87.5%) patients bacteriologically evaluable. Toxic effects comprised gastrointestinal disturbances in eight patients (14%) and one (2%) possible skin rash. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that oral streptogramins may be useful in the management of debilitated patients with MRSA infections.
TI  - Acute septic arthritis of the hip in children in northern Australia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology, microbiology and clinical management of all children under 15 years of age presenting with acute septic arthritis of the hip to Royal Darwin Hospital from July 1994 to December 1999 were reviewed and the diagnostic value of various biological markers assessed. METHODS: Systematic review was undertaken of case notes of patients identified by searching the computerized hospital patient database and the admission records for the children's ward. RESULTS: Eleven cases were identified: 10 aboriginal and one caucasian. The mean temperature, white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) at presentation were 39.2 degrees C, 15,500/mL, 65 mm/h and 144 mg/L, respectively. All had ESR and/or CRP >20. Plain radiographs and ultrasonography were abnormal in 1/8 and 5/6 cases, respectively. Pathogens were isolated in nine cases: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1). Patients received intravenous antibiotics for 8.6 days (range: 3-15 days) and subsequent oral antibiotics for 22 days (range: 0-42 days). The mean (range) time from hospital admission to arthrotomy; from hospital admission to antibiotic administration; and the overall hospital stay was 23 h (range: 3-48 h); 6 h (range: 0-48 h); and 41 days (range: 6-110 days), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of temperature, white cell count, ESR and CRP were useful indicators of septic arthritis but initial diagnosis must be made on a clinical basis. Many patients had to be transferred from regional aboriginal communities and there was significant delay from onset of symptoms to arthrotomy.
TI  - Naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary IgA levels.
AB  - Lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. Since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. A study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary IgA directed against surface antigens bacteria frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Streptococcus pyogenes (SPy), Morraxella catarrhalis (MC), Haemophylus influenzae (HI), and Streptococcus pnumoniae (SPn). In 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific IgA antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. In the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had IgA directed, respectively, to KP and SA, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. We found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary IgA in the adult than in the pediatric population for all the microorganism evaluated. In addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific IgA at oropharingeal level was KP. Interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. Nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (Ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. These results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.
TI  - [In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory pathogens in Latin America].
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and six other antibiotics frequently used in respiratory tract infections, against 1563 Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis clinical isolates from 21 centers in 10 Latin American countries from March 2000 to April 2001. Moxifloxacin was the most active compound against all the species included. Moxifloxacin was 2- to 4-fold more active than levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. This difference was much higher against levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC: 0.5 mg/l vs 8 mg/l). The activity of moxifloxacin against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was similar to levofloxacin; all the isolates were inhibited at < or = 1 mg/l concentrations of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin.
TI  - Arthroscopic treatment of septic arthritis of the hip.
AB  - Arthroscopic debridement and drainage was done in 10 patients with septic arthritis of the hip. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly identified organism. All patients were placed in the supine position on a fracture table and three arthroscopic portals were used during the procedure. No major complication related to the arthroscopy of the hip resulted. The average followup was 4 years 11 months. All patients had excellent results.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of a group A Streptococcus operon encoding serum opacity factor and a novel fibronectin-binding protein, SfbX.
AB  - The group A Streptococcus (GAS) sof gene encodes the serum opacity factor protein, which is capable of opacifying mammalian sera and binding at least two host proteins, fibronectin and fibrinogen. The sof gene exists in approximately 50% of clinical isolates, and there is a classical association of so-called nephritogenic strains with the opacity factor-positive phenotype. In both a type emm49 strain and a type emm12 strain, the sequences upstream of the 5' end of sof and downstream of the putative terminator were determined to be nearly identical to a region in the M type 1 genome approximately 10 kb upstream of the emm1 gene. This close genetic linkage is likely reflected in the strict correlation of opacity factor phenotype with specific emm genotypes. A new fibronectin-binding protein gene, sfbX, was discovered immediately downstream of sof in emm12 and emm49 strains and in several other sof-positive strains. The sof and sfbX genes were found to be expressed on the same transcription unit, which was correlated with the putative promoter and rho-independant terminator sequences that flank these two genes. The sfbX genes from different emm types are predicted to encode approximately 650-residue surface-bound proteins sharing 89 to 92% sequence identity. SfbX residues approximately 1 to 480 are not highly similar to those of other known proteins, with the closest match being the Staphylococcus aureus coagulase protein. The remaining portions of these proteins (residues 481 to 650) contain four putative fibronectin-binding repeats highly similar to those of other streptococcal fibronectin-binding proteins and a potential LP(X)SG cell wall anchor motif. Targeted in-frame allelic-exchange mutagenesis, complementation, and heterologous-expression studies found that serum opacification is encoded by sof alone and that sfbX encodes a fibronectin-binding function. A recombinant SfbX protein was found to bind immobilized fibronectin and to partially inhibit GAS adherence to fibronectin. The sfbX gene was found to be present only in sof-positive strains, and together these genes could influence the spectrum of tissues colonized by sof-positive GAS.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  - Human beta defensin 2 (hbetaD-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. We hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2, measured by reverse transcription-PCR, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetaD-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. Expression of hbetaD-2 was induced consistently by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of S. pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetaD-2. No correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2. S. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetaD-2 than S. epidermidis. We conclude that the ability to induce hbetaD-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetaD-2 expression by S. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. Induction of expression of hbetaD-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable S. epidermidis to survive on the skin surface and modulate hbetaD-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

TI  - Is antimicrobial resistance also subject to globalization?
AB  - In recent years one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of resistance to antibacterial agents among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. There are profound geographic differences in the incidence of resistance among pathogens of the respiratory tract, only some of which can be explained by the local use of antibiotics. A high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics. In contrast, beta-lactamase production among strains of Haemophilus influenzae rarely reaches more than 30% around the world. Methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is a common and increasing problem in hospitals but its extent varies both locally and nationally. Resistance is usually associated with the local spread of resistant strains. High standards of hygiene in hospitals can prevent the spread of such strains but once established they can be difficult to eradicate. Although Streptococcus pyogenes remains highly susceptible to penicillins, even after many decades of their use, resistance to macrolides has occurred. This resistance can rise and fall. Although the increase of macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes can often be associated with an increase in the use of these drugs, this is not always so. In some cases it has been shown to be caused by the spread of one or more resistant clones. Eradication of these clones can reduce the level of resistance markedly. Resistance to both macrolides and penicillins among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae is seen world-wide but is highly variable from country to country. Local habits of drug usage may play a part. In Italy, for example, there is preference for the use of parenteral third-generation cephalosporins for some severe infections and there is a corresponding low level of penicillin-resistance among pneumococci.

TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - [Dependence of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations on causative microorganisms able to produce superantigens].
AB  - A retrospective study of 176 immunologically tested patients admitted to Kaunas Medical University Hospital during 1997-2000 was performed. All patients had positive bacteriological culture test result confirming an infectious etiology of the disease. Our results showed that majority of immunological parameters were dependent on such non-specific factors as intensity and localization of the inflammatory process, an overall functional status of the patient, and the number of the disease exacerbation episodes during the last year before admission. In contrast to this, the absolute number of CD4 lymphocytes, the relative amount of HLA-DR positive lymphocytes and the index of neutrophil latex phagocytosis were exceptionally dependent on the species of the causative microorganism, in particular on superantigen producing cocci. In this case, the HLA-DR positive lymphocyte amount and the neutrophil phagocytosis index were significantly higher. In addition, the CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio (the immunoregulatory index) was significantly lower in this group. As much as those findings are concordant with the signs of excessive immune activation, we conclude that they reflect a possible superantigenic action of the disease causing bacteria. Therefore, a need for immunomodulating therapy during the infections caused by species able to produce superantigens is confirmed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of phlorotannins from the brown alga Ecklonia kurome.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of phlorotannins from brown algae against food-borne pathogenic bacteria (25 strains), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (nine strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes (one strain) was examined and compared with that of catechins. In addition, the effect of the oral administration of phlorotannins on mice was investigated. Phlorotannins, which are oligomers of phloroglucinol, were extracted from thalli of the brown alga Ecklonia kurome and prepared by silicic acid chromatography. The bactericidal activity of polyphenols was determined using a broth microdilution method. Of the bacteria tested, Campylobacter spp. were the most susceptible to the phlorotannins. The MBCs of the crude phlorotannins, dieckol and 8,8'-bieckol (hexamers), and that of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against Campylobacter jejuni were 50 mg/L, 0.03 micromol/mL and 0.03 micromol/mL, respectively. On the whole, the bactericidal effects of the phlorotannins were more pronounced than those of the catechins. The phlorotannins were as effective against MRSA as against the other bacteria tested. At twice the MBCs, all Vibrio parahaemolyticus were killed within 0.5-2 h. However, at the same concentration, catechins showed little bactericidal activity within 4 h. No effect on mice was observed with oral administration of the phlorotannins under the conditions tested.
TI  - Vaginal discharge due to undiagnosed bilateral duplicated collecting system with  ectopic ureters in a three-year-old female: an initial high index of suspicion for sexual abuse.
AB  - In prepubertal girls with vaginal discharge, consideration of the etiology must be given to respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis), enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Yersinia), poor hygiene, foreign body, nonabsorbent undergarments, irritants, vulvar skin disease, anatomic abnormalities (double vagina with fistula, pelvic abscess, and ectopic ureter), and sexual abuse. Prepubertal girls, outside the newborn period, with suspected gonococcal infection should be strongly considered to be victims of sexual abuse, once congenital and other newborn acquired forms of gonorrhea are excluded. We present a case of a three-year-old female with vaginal discharge and fever with a clouded social history, disproportionate distress on physical exam, and initial laboratory gram stain suggestive of gonococcus.
TI  - Virulence factor expression by Gram-positive cocci exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is a new oxazolidinone with potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive cocci; it uniquely inhibits bacterial translation through inhibition of 70S initiation complex formation. The effects of sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations of linezolid on the expression of various structural and soluble virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were examined. For S. aureus, strains Wood 46 and Cowan 1 (NCTC 8532) were used to measure protein A, coagulase, alpha-haemolysin (hla) and delta-haemolysin (hld). For S. pyogenes, strain NCTC 9994 was used to measure M protein, streptolysin O (SLO) and DNase. Coagulase was assayed by clotting of citrated rabbit plasma, and hla, hld and SLO by lysis of rabbit, human and horse erythrocytes, respectively. Protein A and M protein were measured indirectly using bacterial susceptibility to phagocytic ingestion of radiolabelled bacteria by human neutrophils. When S. aureus was grown in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC, linezolid, coagulase, hla and hld production were impaired. Susceptibility to phagocytosis was changed by growth in the presence of 1/2 MIC linezolid compared with that in its absence (50.8 +/- 4.1% versus 38.9 +/- 2.9%; P <or= 0.05). When S. pyogenes was grown in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC linezolid, SLO and DNase production were impaired compared with that of bacteria grown in the absence of the drug; its susceptibility to phagocytosis was also increased (52.8% bacteria ingested versus 37.5%; P <or= 0.05). A reduction in virulence factor expression at sub-MIC linezolid concentrations may be of benefit in the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Induction of platelet thrombi by bacteria and antibodies.
AB  - We have characterized 2 distinct mechanisms through which infectious agents may promote platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in flowing blood, thus contributing to the progression of disease. In one case, the process initiates when the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) mediates platelet arrest onto immobilized bacterial constituents that have bound plasma fibrinogen. If blood contains antibodies against the bacteria, immunoglobulin (Ig) G may cluster on the same surface and activate adherent platelets through the Fc(gamma)RIIA receptor, leading to thrombus growth. As an alternative, bacteria that cannot bind fibrinogen may attach to substrates, such as immobilized plasma proteins or components of the extracellular matrix, which also support platelet adhesion. As a result of this colocalization, IgG bound to bacteria can activate neighboring platelets and induce thrombus growth regardless of their ability to initiate platelet-surface contact. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic constituents of infectious agents and host proteins play distinct but complementary roles in recruiting platelets into thrombi, possibly contributing to complications of acute and chronic infections.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in Jimma Hospital.
AB  - Gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients. The pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between January 1997 and June 2000 in Jimma Hospital. Of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. The following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), CoNS, 36 (31.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) Streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and Streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. The in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin G, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. The majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. The resistance patterns of S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7% and 100% respectively. Penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects (< 60%) on both S. aureus and CoNS. Multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. All isolates of S. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. This entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance amongst isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in the PROTEKT antimicrobial surveillance programme during 1999-2000.
AB  - The pattern of susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was tested for 1485 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1547 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus included in the international PROTEKT (Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin) surveillance study (1999-2000). Overall, almost 10% of S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin A resistant. There was a wide heterogeneity of resistance, with high levels of macrolide resistance in Poland (42%), Hong Kong (28%), Italy (25%), Portugal (24%) and Spain (21%), and no macrolide resistance in Indonesia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. Using NCCLS tentative breakpoints, 97.6% of isolates were susceptible to telithromycin, with MIC(90) < or = 0.015 mg/L in most regions. Resistance among S. pyogenes to the beta-lactams (MIC(90) < or = 0.12 mg/L for all except cefaclor) and fluoroquinolones was not detected. Macrolide resistance was present among the S. aureus isolates, and as with S. pyogenes, there was a wide heterogeneity of resistance, with lower rates in Australia, Indonesia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland. Methicillin-resistant isolates were resistant to the beta-lactams and the macrolides. Resistance to telithromycin was detected in methicillin-resistant isolates in Latin and North America, Asia and Europe. Telithromycin resistance was non-existent or low (MIC(90 )range 0.06-0.25 mg/L) in Australia, Indonesia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland. Regardless of methicillin susceptibility, resistance to linezolid, teicoplanin or vancomycin was not apparent globally.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg BID with either cefuroxime 250 mg BID or cefadroxil 500 mg BID for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. Because these infections typically are confined to the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. OBJECTIVE: This paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. METHODS: Two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each BID for 10 days. Study 1 compared cefditoren with cefuroxime; Study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. Clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). Patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. Within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. Cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. Clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. At the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in Study 1 (P = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in Study 2 (P = 0.018). Eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for Peptostreptococcus species in Study 2 (P = 0.016 and P = 0.003, respectively). A minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each P < 0.05). All 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.
TI  - [Profile of microorganisms isolated in nasopharyngeal swabs from the patients with acute infectious mononucleosis].
AB  - Infectious mononucleosis is a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disorder, which contribute to the development of the various clinical symptoms. Exudative tonsillitis was found to be caused by Epstein-Barr virus in 19% of all viral infections and may imitate a bacterial etiology. The aim of this study was to identify the microbes from the nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from the patients with exudative tonsillitis and to assess their susceptibility to antibiotics. The patients were hospitalized as an infectious mononucleosis after unsuccessful antibiotic therapy. 84 patients were investigated: group I--patients with serological positive infectious mononucleosis tests and group II--patients with acute exudative tonsillitis and with serologically excluded infectious mononucleosis. The diagnosis was confirmed clinically, haematologically, biochemically and serologically. Nasopharyngeal specimens were taken, once, at the first day of hospitalization. Then, routine microbiological assays were performed. Isolated strains were identified biochemically: API Strep, API Staph, API E, API Ne, APINH (bioMerieux). The susceptibility to antibiotics with an agar diffusion assay was performed according to Kirby-Bauer. We concluded that various, potentially pathogenic bacterial flora was found in throat during infectious mononucleosis. Haemophilus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus MSSA were isolated more frequently. Haemophilus influence was susceptible to cefotaxime and azytromycine. Candida albicans was isolated in every fourth patient. Streptococcus pyogenes as an etiological agent of exudative tonsillitis was confirmed in the group II. The pharyngeal candidiosis was also observed more frequently in the group II.
TI  - Pyoderma among Hajj Pilgrims in Makkah.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial skin infections have been considered as a possible health problem of the Hajj pilgrims. Significant increase in the rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics against gram positive organisms has been observed. The present study was planned to obtain the microbiological profile of bacterial skin infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobials. METHODS: Pyodermas were investigated clinically and bacteriologically by a prospective study conducted on patients attending the dermatology clinic at the King Faisal Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 Hajj periods (2000 - 2001). RESULTS: Of a total of 80 pyoderma patients, 52.5% were primary and 47.5% secondary. The leading cause of primary pyoderma was found to be impetigo in 28.8% cases, and of secondary pyoderma was infected eczema in 18.8% cases. Positive cultures were found in 87.5% cases. The organisms responsible for primary pyoderma were: Staphylococcus aureus (65.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (28.1%) or both (6.4%) while in secondary pydermas were: Staphylococcus aureus (44.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (15.8%), or both (18.4%), and gram negative bacilli (21.1%). The resistant pattern of antimicrobials against Staphylococcus aureus was as follows: penicillin 80.85%, tetracycline 10.6%, gentamicin 6.4%, erythromycin 4.3% and cotrimoxazole [corrected] 4.3%. Oxacillin and cephalothin were found least resistant (2.1%). CONCLUSION: Pyoderma appeared as one of the common health hazard of our Hajj pilgrims. Penicillin and tetracycline are found ineffective in treating skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus while oxacillin is recommended as first line of treatment.

TI  - Fatal group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in a patient with psoriasis and chronic renal impairment.
AB  - A 78-year-old woman presented with rapid onset of skin pain which evolved into oedema, discoloration and infarction. She was diagnosed with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The patient had a past history of psoriasis and end-stage renal impairment. Despite treatment with multiple antibiotics in an intensive care unit, the skin infarction involving the upper trunk continued to expand and the patient died within 24 hours of hospital admission. Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured from a tissue biopsy. Renal failure and compromised skin barrier function are known to predispose to invasive streptococcal infections, but necrotizing fasciitis has only rarely been reported in association with psoriasis. This case illustrates the fulminant nature of the infection.
TI  - Defense against biologic warfare with superantigen toxins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Superantigens produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are among the most lethal of toxins. Toxins in this family trigger an excessive cellular immune response leading to toxic shock. OBJECTIVES: To design an antagonist that is effective in vivo against a broad spectrum of superantigen toxins. METHODS: Short peptide antagonists were selected for their ability to inhibit superantigen-induced expression of human genes for cytokines that mediate shock. The ability of these peptides to protect mice against lethal toxin challenge was examined. RESULTS: Antagonist peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with staphylococcal enterotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, superantigens that share only 6% overall amino acid homology. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Antagonist peptides show homology to a beta-strand/hinge/alpha-helix domain that is structurally conserved among superantigens, yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class II molecule and T cell receptor that function in toxic T cell hyperactivation. CONCLUSIONS: The lethal effect of superantigens can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade before activation of T cells occurs. Superantigenic toxin antagonists may serve not only as countermeasures to biologic warfare but may be useful in the treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock, as well as in some cases of septic shock.
TI  - [Lung abscess due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an adolescent].
AB  - Pulmonary abscess is an uncommon complication of pneumonia in children. Pyogenes, in particular Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae are the principal responsible bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is rarely the cause. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old child was hospitalized with right thoracic pain. The patient was non-febrile and had a recent history of moderate infection. He was receiving antibiotic (macrolide) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. CT scan confirmed a mid-lobe abscess in the right lung. Interruption of therapy resulted in fever and increase in C-reactive level with hyperleucocytosis, suggesting that the abscess was caused by a bacterial infection. The child's general condition and the radiographic picture improved with combined antibiotic therapy with amoxycillin and clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides and macrolides. The suspected diagnostic of M. pneumoniae was confirmed by increased IgM antibodies for M. pneumoniae. Recovery was complete two months later without sequelae. COMMENT: Pulmonary abscess is a rare complication of M. pneumoniae infection in children. This complication should be considered when the general condition does not improve despite appropriate early treatment of a pneumonia, as in the case of our patient.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - Factors Optimizing the Use of Subcutaneous Vascular Access Ports in Weaned Pigs.
AB  - Young, recently weaned pigs were implanted with subcutaneous vascular access ports in experiments designed to determine the relative bioavailability of lead from contaminated soils. In nine experiments, a total of 72 subcutaneous vascular access ports were implanted. Complications were observed in 38.9% of the implanted pigs. Changes in the protocol were implemented in an effort to reduce the rate of complications. The majority of complications were septic processes, including localized infections around the site of the catheter and injection port, hematogenous pulmonary abscessation, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. Staphylococcus aureus, S. hyicus, b-hemolytic Streptococcus species, and Actinomyces pyogenes were cultured from septic processes in these pigs. Our findings suggest that the health of the skin at the time of surgery, the experience of the surgeon, and the immunologic status of the animal influence the risk of septic complications in pigs implanted with subcutaneous vascular access ports.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against community-acquired respiratory pathogens from three European countries.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. A European resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. Studies were conducted in Italy, Spain and Austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the NCCLS-recommended broth microdilution method. Among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. Cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. Pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. These data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.
TI  - Anthrax in adults and children: a review of 132 cases in Turkey.
AB  - In this retrospective study, 132 cases of anthrax observed in a Turkish hospital  over a 14-year period (October 1986 to October 2000) were evaluated with respect to clinical features, therapy, and outcome. The results show that anthrax is a disease of significance in the Eastern Anatolian region of Turkey. Preventive measures such as education of the population and vaccination of animals against anthrax would reduce the incidence of the disease.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Expression of fibronectin-binding protein FbpA modulates adhesion in Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Fibronectin binding is considered to be an important virulence factor in streptococcal infections. Adhesion of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to immobilized forms of fibronectin is mediated, in part, by a high molecular mass wall-anchored protein designated CshA. In this study, a second fibronectin-binding protein of S. gordonii is described that has been designated as FbpA (62.7 kDa). This protein, which is encoded by a gene located immediately downstream of the cshA gene, shows 85 and 81% identity to the fibronectin-binding proteins PavA, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and FBP54, of Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. Purified recombinant FbpA bound to immobilized human fibronectin in a dose-dependant manner, and isogenic mutants in which the fbpA gene was inactivated were impaired in their binding to fibronectin. This effect was apparent only for cells in the exponential phase of growth, and was associated with reduced surface hydrophobicity and the surface expression of CshA. Cells in the stationary phase of growth were unaffected in their ability to bind to fibronectin. By utilizing gene promoter fusions with cat (encoding chloramphenicol O-acetyltransferase), it was demonstrated that cshA expression was down-regulated during the exponential phase of growth in the fbpA mutant. Expression of fbpA, but not cshA, was sensitive to atmospheric O2 levels, and was found to be up-regulated in the presence of elevated O2 levels. The results suggest that FbpA plays a regulatory role in the modulation of CshA expression and, thus, affects the adhesion of S. gordonii to fibronectin.
TI  - Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir. METHODS: Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed. RESULTS: Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Comparison of selection for mutants with reduced susceptibility to ABT-773, erythromycin and rifampicin in respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Attempts were made to select mutants on agar media containing the new ketolide ABT-773, erythromycin or rifampicin, at concentrations above the MICs, from Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, including erythromycin-resistant strains. ABT-773 did not select for mutants in four strains, whereas in eight strains the frequencies at 72 h were < or = 10(-9). ABT-773 MICs were 0.015-4 mg/L for mutants, except those selected from inducible Erm(A) S. aureus. Mutants selected on ABT-773 or erythromycin were cross-resistant to ABT-773, erythromycin and, sometimes, clindamycin. The susceptibility profiles indicate that different mutations were selected and that ABT-773 and erythromycin may interact with the ribosome differently.
TI  - Clinical judgment predicts culture results in upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We wanted to describe the natural history, familial transmission, microbiology, and accuracy of clinical judgment of potential pathogens of respiratory tract infections in a community family practice. METHODS: The study was a prospective case series in which consecutive patients requesting treatment for respiratory tract infections were evaluated after nurse triage during 3 fall-spring months in a solo family practice in suburban Cleveland, Ohio. According to the physician's usual practice, patients were classified into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups for bacterial illness based on their clinical signs and symptoms. Cultures were performed and sensitivities were determined for pathogens from the infected throat, nasopharynx, conjunctiva, or other sites. Patient symptoms and well-being were scored at the initial visit and at 3, 7 and 14 days later. RESULTS: There were 111 illness episodes in 86 patients; 94% had cultures taken, of which 38% grew a potentially pathogenic bacteria, most commonly group A streptococci, Branhamella catarrhalis or Staphylococcus aureus. The physician's judgment of bacterial infection was associated (P < .001) with having a positive culture (sensitivity 53%, specificity 78%, positive and negative predictive values 60% and 73%, respectively). A positive culture was associated with 2 of 16 signs or symptoms: purulent discharge from any site or a red swollen eye. There was no association of treatment status with clinical outcomes during 2 weeks of follow-up observation. CONCLUSION: Infection with a potentially pathogenic bacteria is difficult to determine solely by clinical signs and symptoms, but clinical judgment is associated with positive culture results. The effect of selective treatment of upper respiratory tract infection based on clinical signs and symptoms and patient and family culture results remains to be determined, but using clinical judgment could result in more selective antibiotic use than found in current practice patterns.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue infection.
AB  - Abstract. Normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. The most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). Skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. This article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. Impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by S. aureus and / or Group A streptoccus. In mild and localized impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin should be used. Folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by S. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. These conditions can be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by S. aureus of phase group II. Intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. Erysipelas and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or S. aureus requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. Gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Epidemiology and microbiology of cellulitis and bacterial soft tissue infection during HIV disease: a 10-year survey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of HIV disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven bacteriologically proven consecutive episodes were identified among 2221 HIV-infected patients hospitalized in a 10-year period, and assessed according to several epidemiological, microbiological and clinical variables. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently cultured pathogen (50% of 92 isolates), followed by Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes; a polymicrobial infection was present in 38.1% of episodes. Drug addiction (p < 0.003) and male gender (p < 0.04) were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, which were community-acquired in 83.6% of cases. While a remarkable variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown, hematogenous dissemination occurred in 25.4% of episodes, and proved significantly related to a low CD4+ lymphocyte count, and neutropenia. A 21.7% methicillin-resistance rate was shown among S. aureus isolates. All episodes were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam-aminglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis occurred in four patients only. CONCLUSION: Skin and soft tissue infections are continuing causes of morbidity in HIV-infected patients, even in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era.
TI  - rpoB mutation conferring rifampin resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes BM4478 and Staphylococcus aureus BM4479 were isolated from a patient undergoing rifampin therapy. High-level resistance to rifampin was due to the following mutations in the rpoB gene: Ser522Leu in strain BM4478 and His526Asn and Ser574Leu in strain BM4479.
TI  - Superantigens: microbial agents that corrupt immunity.
AB  - Microbial superantigens are a family of protein exotoxins that share the ability  to trigger excessive and aberrant activation of T cells. The best characterised are the staphylococcal enterotoxins and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins that trigger the staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes. It is now apparent that superantigens have a wider role in the pathology of infectious diseases than has previously been appreciated. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes together produce 19 different superantigens. The range of microorganisms known to produce superantigens has expanded to include Gram negative bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses. Research is beginning to shed light on the more subtle parts these molecules play in causing disease and to produce some real possibilities for specific treatment of superantigen-induced toxicity. We aim to highlight these new developments and review the science behind these fascinating molecules.
TI  - Skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  - The skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. Skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. Environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. Resident gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium sp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. In order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. Bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. Epidermal infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. Dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. The pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. Moreover, S. aureus and S. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Bartonella sp., Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and Vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.
TI  - Differential recognition of surface proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes by two sortase gene homologs.
AB  - The interaction of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) with its  human host requires several surface proteins. In this study, we isolated mutations in a gene required for the surface localization of protein F by transposon mutagenesis of the M6 strain JRS4. This gene (srtA) encodes a protein homologous to Staphylococcus aureus sortase, which covalently links proteins containing an LPXTG motif to the cell wall. The GAS srtA mutant was defective in anchoring the LPXTG-containing proteins M6, protein F, ScpA, and GRAB to the cell surface. This phenotype was complemented when a wild-type srtA gene was provided in trans. The surface localization of T6, however, was unaffected by the srtA mutation. The M1 genome sequence contains a second open reading frame with a motif characteristic of sortase proteins. Inactivation of this gene (designated srtB) in strain JRS4 affected the surface localization of T6 but not M6, protein F, ScpA, or GRAB. This phenotype was complemented by srtB in trans. An srtA probe hybridized with DNA from all GAS strains tested (M types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 22, and 50 and nontypeable strain 64/14) and from streptococcal groups C and G, while srtB hybridized with DNA from only a few GAS strains. We conclude that srtA and srtB encode sortase enzymes required for anchoring different subsets of proteins to the cell wall. It seems likely that the multiple sortase homologs in the genomes of other gram-positive bacteria have a similar substrate-specific role.
TI  - Killing of Gram-positive cocci by fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - The susceptibilities of three Gram-positive cocci to medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their one-monoglycerides were studied. The bacteria were incubated with equal volumes of lipid solutions for 10 min. Lauric acid, palmitoleic acid and monocaprin reduced the number of CFU by 6.0 log10 or greater at 5 mM concentration for streptococci of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS). When further compared at lower concentrations and after longer incubation time monocaprin proved to be the most active. Capric acid showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus at 10 mM. However, at lower concentrations monocaprin was the only lipid that showed significant activity against S. aureus. The mode of action of monocaprin against GBS was studied by a novel two-color fluorescent assay of bacterial viability and by electron microscopy. The results indicate that the bacteria are killed by disintegration of the cell membrane by the lipid, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. The highly lethal effect of monocaprin indicates that this lipid might be useful as a microbicidal agent for prevention and treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.
TI  - Sinuses, staph, strep, patients, and families.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new ketolide ABT-773 against community acquired respiratory tract isolates and Viridans Streptococci.
AB  - A total of 230 isolates were collected from clinical specimens of patients attending five health centers of the Buenos Aires, Argentina. ABT-773 was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clindamycin against bacterial isolates responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections and viridans streptococci showing different resistance patterns. Time-kill curves were also performed against selected resistant isolates. All but one of the 105 pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to ABT-773. Among the erythromycin resistant S. pyogenes isolates, all the M type and inducible isolates were susceptible to ABT-773. ABT-773 showed excellent activity against macrolide, azalide, lincosamide (MAL) inducible S. aureus producers but was inactive against constitutive producers. ABT-773 activity against viridans streptococci was also excellent.ABT-773 exerted bactericidal activity against selected isolates of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, however, it was only bacteriostatic against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone BMS-284756 against mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus selected with different quinolones.
AB  
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of ABT-773 and telithromycin against macrolide-susceptible and -resistant streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  - The activity of a new ketolide, ABT-773, was compared to the activity of the ketolide telithromycin (HMR-3647) against over 600 gram-positive clinical isolates, including 356 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 167 Staphylococcus aureus, and 136 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. Macrolide-susceptible isolates as well as macrolide-resistant isolates with ribosomal methylase (Erm), macrolide efflux (Mef), and ribosomal mutations were tested using the NCCLS reference broth microdilution method. Both compounds were extremely active against macrolide-susceptible isolates, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC90s) for susceptible streptococci and staphylococci ranging from 0.002 to 0.03 microg/ml for ABT-773 and 0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml for telithromycin. ABT-773 had increased activities against macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (Erm MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml; Mef MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml) compared to those of telithromycin (Erm MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml; Mef MIC90, 1 microg/ml). Both compounds were active against strains with rRNA or ribosomal protein mutations (MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml). ABT-773 was also more active against macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes (ABT-773 Erm MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml; ABT-773 Mef MIC90, 0.12 microg/ml; telithromycin Erm MIC90, >8 microg/ml; telithromycin Mef MIC90, 1.0 microg/ml). Both compounds lacked activity against constitutive macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but had good activities against inducibly resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ABT-773 MIC90, 0.06 microg/ml; telithromycin MIC90, 0.5 microg/ml). ABT-773 has superior activity against macrolide-resistant streptococci compared to that of telithromycin.
TI  - [Current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ENT-infections].
AB  - In bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. S. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. To decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ENT-infections is necessary. The new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. Efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. In more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. Both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. In more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime are widely used and effective. Ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while Ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). A dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ENT-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
TI  - A new antibiotic CJ-17,665 from Aspergillus ochraceus.
AB  - A new antibiotic, CJ-17,665 (I) was isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus ochraceus, CL41582. It inhibits growth of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, with MICs of 12.5, 12.5 and 25 microg/ml, respectively. The structure contains a diketopiperazine and an indole N-oxide moiety that is unusual in natural products.
TI  - Cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. Cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the Gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the important Gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. In healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/L and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/L, respectively. Cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. In two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. Clinical cure rates in patients with AECB were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. In patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. In uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. These cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Cow- and quarter-level risk factors for Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  - This study was designed to identify risk factors for intramammary infections with Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus under field conditions. An 18-mo survey with sampling of all quarters of all lactating cows at 3-wk intervals was carried out in three Dutch dairy herds with medium bulk milk somatic cell count (200,000 to 300,000 cells/ml). Quarter milk samples were used for bacteriology and somatic cell counting. Data on parity, lactation stage, and bovine herpesvirus 4-serology were recorded for each animal. During the last year of the study, body condition score, and teat-end callosity scores were recorded at 3-wk intervals. A total of 93 new infections with Strep. uberis were detected in 22,665 observations on quarters at risk for Strep. uberis infection, and 100 new infections with Staph. aureus were detected in 22,593 observations on quarters at risk for Staph. aureus infection. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis with clustering at herd and cow level was used to identify risk factors for infection. Rate of infection with Strep. uberis was lower in first- and second-parity cows than in older cows, and depended on stage of lactation in one herd. Quarters that were infected with Arcanobacterium pyogenes or enterococci, quarters that had recovered from Strep. uberis- or Staph. aureus-infection in the past, and quarters that were exposed to another Strep. uberis infected quarter in the same cow had a higher rate of Strep. uberis infection. Teat-end callosity and infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria were not significant as risk factors. Rate of Staph. aureus infection was higher in bovine herpesvirus 4-seropositive cows, in right quarters, in quarters that had recovered from Staph. aureus or Strep. uberis infection, in quarters exposed to other Staph. aureus infected quarters in the same cow, and in quarters with extremely callused teat ends. Infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci was not significant as a risk factor. The effect of infection with corynebacteria on rate of infection with Staph. aureus depended on herd, stage of lactation, and teat-end roughness. Herd level prevalence of Strep. uberis or Staph. aureus, and low quarter milk somatic cell count were not associated with an increased rate of infection for Strep. uberis or Staph. aureus.
TI  - Review of cefditoren, an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefditoren is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic approved for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections in adult and adolescent patients. OBJECTIVE: This article briefly reviews the chemistry, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of cefditoren. METHODS: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1985 to October 2001) of the medical literature, review of the English-language literature, reference lists within these articles, as well as data presented at the 40th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. RESULTS: Cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobes, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefditoren is rapidly absorbed (time to peak plasma concentration, approximately 2-3 hours) from the gastrointestinal tract and is almost completely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of the compound is approximately 0.8 to 1.3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Cefditoren is effective in the management of AECB (in regimens of 400 mg twice daily for 10 days) and acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngotonsillitis due to S pyogenes, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections (in regimens of 200 mg twice daily for 10 days). Cefditoren possesses broad activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of numerous beta-lactamases. Its pharmacokinetic properties, in conjunction with in vitro susceptibility data, document the feasibility of twice-daily dosing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on respiratory tract pathogens, using a modified dilution assay method.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the antibacterial effects of a wide variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major components was evaluated by agar-plate dilution assay under sealed conditions, with agar used as a stabilizer for homogeneous dispersion. Of the selected strains of four major bacteria causing respiratory tract infection, Haemophilus influenzae was most susceptible to the essential oils, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus was less susceptible. No cross-resistance was observed between penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Escherichia coli, used as a control bacterium, showed the lowest susceptibility. Essential oils containing aldehyde or phenol as a major component showed the highest antibacterial activity, followed by the essential oils containing terpene alcohols. Other essential oils, containing terpene ketone, or ether, had much weaker activity, and an oil containing terpene hydrocarbon was inactive. Based on these findings, thyme (wild, red, and geraniol types), cinnamon bark, lemongrass, perilla, and peppermint oils were selected for further evaluation of their effects on respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against respiratory pathogens isolated from children in Japan.
AB  - There is an increasing spread and incidence of penicillin-resistant bacteria that are becoming less susceptible to commonly prescribed oral antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Against this background, we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and the in-vitro activity of oral antimitrobials. Between April 1996 and December 1997, in 245 children with respiratory tract infections (bronchitis in 61, pharyngitis in 115, and tonsillitis in 69), 119 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 89 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 61 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 34 strains of Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from the pharynx. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed by a broth microdilution method. The isolation incidence of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-highly resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 59.0% and 13.1%, respectively. Most strains of PISP and PRSP were highly resistant to cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefteram, cefdinir, clarithromycin, ampicillin, and minocycline, but susceptibile to ofloxacin and cefditoren (CDTR). The in-vitro activity of CDTR was superior to that of other cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime, when tested against both the beta-lactamase-positive and -negative H. influenzae isolated. CDTR was also active against all the other strains, including methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and M. catarrhalis. This study suggested that CDTR was a useful oral antibiotic for pediatric respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also present in S. suis.
TI  - Correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. Depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. Modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of Mycobacterium bovis BCG pcp gene encoding pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase.
AB  - The Mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) pcp gene that encodes the pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (Pcp) was cloned from a lambdagtll genomic library and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence contains a 669 bp open reading frame coding for a protein of 222 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,209 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to the Pcps from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. A multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved domains. The BCG pcp gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The Pcp was purified to homogeneity. The recombinant protein was further confirmed by an enzymatic assay.
TI  - Structural decomposition and heterogeneity of commercial lipoteichoic Acid preparations.
AB  - Fractionation of commercial preparations of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed very inhomogeneous compositions and decomposition of the LTA structure: LTA content of the preparations averaged 61% for Streptococcus pyogenes, 16% for Bacillus subtilis, and 75% for Staphylococcus aureus. The decomposition was characterized by a loss of glycerophosphate units as well as alanine and N-acetylglucosamine substituents. All preparations contained-to varying degrees-non-LTA, non-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunostimulatory components as indicated by their elution profile in HIC, lack of phosphate, and negative Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test results. After purification, the commercial LTA from Bacillus subtilis and S. pyogenes but not LTA from S. aureus induced the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and IL-10 in human blood. While pure LTA are negative in the LAL assay, endotoxin equivalents of more than 10 ng of LPS/mg of LTA were found in the commercial preparations. Taken together, these data indicate that these crude preparations with relatively high endotoxin contamination are not suitable for characterizing the activation of immune cells by LTA.
TI  - Sample preparation of Gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  - A new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell Gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI ToF MS). With fresh, whole-cell Gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kDa. Because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for Gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by MALDI ToF MS. Lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kDa protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. A significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kDa range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. We show that for four different species (Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. The data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.
TI  - Group a streptococcus spinal epidural abscess during varicella.
AB  - Multiple complications of varicella have been described. Musculoskeletal complications (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis) as well as neurologic complications (ataxia, encephalitis, and transverse myelitis) are well-known. We describe the cases of 2 children, ages 18 months and 5 years, who were admitted recently to 2 pediatric hospitals in Montreal with a resolving varicella, abdominal and lumbar pain, and a refusal to walk and in whom a diagnosis of epidural abscess caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) was established. No previous case of epidural abscess caused by GAS in the context of varicella has been reported. Epidural abscesses are rare in pediatrics and are caused mainly by hematogenous spread of Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnosis in pediatrics is challenging because it is rare and does not present as classically as in adults. The prognosis is related to the presence of neurologic deficits before surgery and to the rapidity with which the diagnosis and the intervention are made. These cases highlight a new clinical association in children of epidural abscess caused by GAS and varicella. An early clinical diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion when back or abdominal pain with or without neurologic signs and symptoms occurs during or soon after varicella.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Identification and epidemiologic investigation of bacteria by the Riboprinter Microbial Characterization System, the automated ribotyping system].
AB  - An automated ribotyping system, RiboPrinter Microbial Characterization System(Qualicon), was evaluated as a typing tool. Strains used in this study is as follows; 40 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with 40 distinct PFGE patterns, 20 MRSA from two hospital ward with suspicion of outbreaks, 53 strains of Escherichia coli including 43 strains of pathogenic E. coli, and 50 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes including 31 strains from patients with severe streptococcal disease. Typeability was 100%. Excellent result was obtained in identificating E. coli including Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157, but poor in two species of gram positive cocci. Concerning discriminatory power, the RiboPrinter was generally less sensitive than PFGE in identifying different strains, but good correlation with strain relatedness by PFGE and antigenic classification. RiboPrinter surpassed PFGE at handling, result interpretation, and rapidity, therefore, hierarchical approach with the first pass through the RiboPrinter followed by PFGE as the occasion demands can be very useful to save labor. The RiboPrinter has the potential to be a widely useful tool in molecular epidemiology.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated in 1998 and 1999 from patients with infections of upper airways residing in Western Pomerania.
AB  - Sensitivity to antibiotics of the most common pathogens isolated from the upper airways in north-west part of Poland shown significant regional variation. The rise in resistance to penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae (to 22%) and to macrolides for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus was observed. No differences in sensitivity have been found between pathogens isolated from hospital and ambulatory patients.
TI  - Novel erythromycin derivatives with aryl groups tethered to the C-6 position are  potent protein synthesis inhibitors and active against multidrug-resistant respiratory pathogens.
AB  - A novel series of erythromycin derivatives has been discovered with potent activity against key respiratory pathogens, including those resistant to erythromycin. These compounds are characterized by having an aryl group tethered to the C-6 position of the erythronolide skeleton. Extensive structural modification of the C-6 moiety led to the discovery of several promising compounds with potent activity against both mef- and erm-mediated resistant Streptoccoccus pneumoniae. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the new macrolides are potent protein synthesis inhibitors, which interact with methylated ribosomes isolated from resistant organisms. In experimental animal models, these compounds exhibited excellent in vivo efficacy and balanced pharmacokinetic profiles.
TI  - Structural and functional role of threonine 112 in a superantigen Staphylococcus  aureus enterotoxin B.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens are potent T-cell stimulatory protein molecules produced  by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Their superantigenic activity can be attributed to their ability to cross-link major histocompatibility complex class II molecules with T-cell receptors (TCRs) to form a tri-molecular complex. Each superantigen is known to interact with a specific V(beta) element of TCR. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, a superantigen), a primary cause of food poisoning, is also responsible for a significant percentage of non-menstrual associated toxic shock syndrome in patients with a variety of staphylococcal infections. Structural studies have elucidated a binding cavity on the toxin molecule essential for TCR binding. To understand the crucial residues involved in binding, mutagenesis analysis was performed. Our analysis suggest that mutation of a conserved residue Thr(112) to Ser (T112S) in the binding cavity induces a selective reduction in the affinity for binding one TCR V(beta) family and can be attributed to the structural differences in the native and mutant toxins. We present a detailed comparison of the mutant structure determined at 2.0 A with the previously reported native SEB and SEB-TCR V(beta) complex structures.
TI  - Fba, a novel fibronectin-binding protein from Streptococcus pyogenes, promotes bacterial entry into epithelial cells, and the fba gene is positively transcribed under the Mga regulator.
AB  - In infection by Streptococcus pyogenes, fibronectin (Fn)-binding proteins play important roles as adhesins and invasins. Here, we present a novel Fn-binding protein of S. pyogenes that exhibits a low similarity to other Fn-binding proteins reported. After searching the Oklahoma Streptococcal Genome Sequencing Database for open reading frames (ORFs) with an LPXTG motif, nine ORFs were found among those recognized as putative surface proteins, and one of them was designated as Fba. The fba gene was found in M types 1, 2, 4, 22, 28 and 49 of S. pyogenes, but not in other serotypes or groups of streptococci. Fba, a 37.8 kDa protein, possesses three or four proline-rich repeat domains and exhibits a high homology to FnBPA, the Fn-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus. Recombinant Fba exhibited a strong binding ability to Fn. In addition, Fba-deficient mutants showed diminished invasive capabilities to HEp-2 cells and low mortality in mice following skin infection. The fba gene was located downstream of the mga regulon and analysis using an mga-inactivated mutant revealed that it was transcribed under the control of the Mga regulator. These results indicate that Fba is a novel protein and one of the important virulence factors of S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Clinical significance of the Streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  - Few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. Although Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. Few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. We studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000. The Streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by Eikenella corrodens (9.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and S. pyogenes (3.2%). The S. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. These species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. Since hemolytic patterns of the S. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. We found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. Although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the S. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. As antibiotics began being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.
TI  - Administration of superantigens protects mice from lethal Listeria monocytogenes  infection by enhancing cytotoxic T cells.
AB  - Superantigens stimulate T-cell-receptor Vbeta-selective T-cell proliferation accompanying the release of cytokines, which may eventually protect the host from microbial infections. We investigated here whether superantigens can rescue the host from lethal bacterial infection. Mice were pretreated with Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) 1 and 2 days before bacterial infection, and the mortality of infected mice was assessed. SEB pretreatment protected mice from lethal infection with Listeria monocytogenes but not from lethal infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. This enhanced protection was also observed upon pretreatment with recombinant streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A. Furthermore, L. monocytogenes-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) due to type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and the cytotoxicity of CD8(+) T cells were significantly enhanced after SEB administration and bacterial infection. Depletion of either CD4(+) T cells or CD8(+) T cells in SEB-pretreated mice completely abolished this protection. This phenomenon was ascribed to the elimination of L. monocytogenes-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). It was found that CD4(+) T cells contributed to the induction of the CTL populations. Furthermore, SEB pretreatment of heat-killed L. monocytogenes-immunized mice enhanced the protection from challenge of L. monocytogenes. Taken together, these results indicated that administrations of superantigens protected mice from infection with L. monocytogenes, which was dependent on the enhanced L. monocytogenes-specific CTL activity in the presence of CD4(+) T cells, and superantigens exhibited adjuvant activity in the immunization against intracellular pathogens.
TI  - An observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. In recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. The aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. Subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. Overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. A total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), Streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). The susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to 95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. In contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. We conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. In particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.
TI  - [Clinical aspects of streptococcal and staphylococcal toxinic diseases].
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce a lot of toxins, some of them responsible for specific diseases. Staphylococcal food poisoning is due to ingestion of enterotoxin containing food. Seven toxins have been isolated so far. Generalized exfoliative syndrome is related to exfoliatin. Young children are particularly affected. The disease consists in a cutaneous exfoliation usually limited with a favourable outcome. The mucus membranes are not involved. The nose or pharynx are the most usual portal of entry. Staphylococcus aureus is not grown from the bullae. Severe extensive forms have been observed particularly in neonates (Ritter's disease). Bullous impetigo is also due to exfoliatin. It consists in the presence of a restricted number of cloudy bullae, from which staphylococcus can be grown. It is a mild disease with a favourable outcome within a few days. Scarlet fever is related to the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins. The classic form of the disease is presently rare. This disease may be related to staphylococcus as a complication of arthritis, osteomyelitis or wound super-infection. Bacteremia is usual. Staphylococcal scarlet fever is not related to exfoliatin as previously believed, but to enterotoxins or TSST-1, so it seems to be an abortive form of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is defined as a multi organ failure syndrome with a rapid onset, fever, rash followed by desquamation, vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, conjunctivitis and strawberry tongue. The disease is related to an infection or colonisation with a toxin (TSST-1) producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterotoxins (mainly C) may be involved. The disease may occur in childhood, sometimes after superinfection of varicella. The mortality is low (5%) and mainly due to ARDS or cardiac problems. Erythrogenic toxins produced by Streptococcus pyogenes are involved in a streptococcal form of toxic shock syndrome with a quite similar presentation. In most cases however, a cutaneous or soft tissue infection is at the origin. Necrotizing fasciitis complicating varicella is a classic cause in children. Bacteremia is often observed. The mortality rate is as high as 60%. The streptococcal strains involved in north america use to produce the toxin erythrogenic A, the european cases seem to be more related to strains secreting the B toxin with a dysregulation of the mechanisms which control the secretion of the toxin. Staphylococcus strains producing the Panton and Valentine leucocidin are responsible for chronic or relapsing furonculosis and above all for a very severe necrotizing pneumonia observed in children and young adults presenting as an acute respiratory distress syndrome with leucopenia, hemoptysis and shock carrying a heavy mortality rate. Besides these specific diseases, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins may be involved in some syndromes of unknown origin, in which the intervention of superantigens seems very likely. Kawasaki syndrome is among them as strains producing staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins have been grown from patients with Kawasaki syndrome. In the same way, the intervention of toxins is suspected in the determination of sudden infant death syndrome and atopic eczema.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates in Argentina.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against 1,000 clinical isolates of 147 Streptococcus pneumoniae (115, penicilin susceptible; 26, intermediate penicillin-resistant and 6, penicillin-resistant), 127 Hemophilus influenzae (109, beta lactamasa non-producer; 18, beta lactamase producers), 95 Streptococcus pyogenes (6, azytromycin-resistant), 84 Moraxella catarrhalis (79, beta lactamase producers), 110 Staphilococcus aureus (89, methicillin-susceptible; 21, methicilin-resistant), 98 Eenterococcus faecalis and 339 Enterobacteriacea, (recovered from patients with respiratory tract infection; skin and soft tissue infection and urinary tract infection), was compared with the activities of four fluorquinolones and five other antimicrobial agents. Of the quinolones tested, gemifloxacin was the most potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin intermediate and resistant strains. Mic(90) values obtained for gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin and trvafloxacin were 0.03, 2, 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/L respectively. Gemifloxacin was 16 fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 32 fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. When tested against Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacteriaceae, all the quinolones showed similar activity. Our results demonstrate that gemifloxacin has similar activity than the other quinolones tested against Gram-negative organisms and is considerably more potent against Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of Streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  - Fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. DNA for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a surface display vector pSAK332, and introduced into L. casei. The fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of Staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of Lactococcus lactis NCDO 763. The fibronectin binding ability of the resulting L. casei was confirmed with Western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. These results indicate that L. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. This L. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome and bacterial superantigens: an update.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute onset illness characterized by fever, rash formation, and hypotension that can lead to multiple organ failure and lethal shock, as well as desquamation in patients that recover. The disease is caused by bacterial superantigens (SAGs) secreted from Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci. SAGs bypass normal antigen presentation by binding to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting cells and to specific variable regions on the beta-chain of the T-cell antigen receptor. Through this interaction, SAGs activate T cells at orders of magnitude above antigen-specific activation, resulting in massive cytokine release that is believed to be responsible for the most severe features of TSS. This review focuses on clinical and epidemiological aspects of TSS, as well as important developments in the genetics, biochemistry, immunology, and structural biology of SAGs. From the evolutionary relationships between these important toxins, we propose that there are five distinct groups of SAGs.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Microbiological profile of telithromycin, the first ketolide antimicrobial.
AB  - Telithromycin, the first of the ketolide antimicrobials, has been specifically designed to provide potent activity against common and atypical/intracellular or cell-associated respiratory pathogens, including those that are resistant to beta-lactams and/or macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLS(B)) antimicrobials. Against gram-positive cocci, telithromycin possesses more potent activity in vitro and in vivo than the macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin. It retains its activity against erm-(MLS(B)) or mef-mediated macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes and against Staphylococcus aureus resistant to macrolides through inducible MLS(B) mechanisms. Telithromycin also possesses high activity against the Gram-negative pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, regardless of beta-lactamase production. In vitro, it shows similar activity to azithromycin against H. influenzae, while in vivo its activity against H. influenzae is higher than that of azithromycin. Telithromycin's spectrum of activity also extends to the atypical, intracellular and cell-associated pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. In vitro, telithromycin does not induce MLS(B) resistance and it shows low potential to select for resistance or cross-resistance to other antimicrobials. These characteristics indicate that telithromycin will have an important clinical role in the empirical treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Cleavage and purification of intein fusion proteins using the Streptococcus gordonii spex system.
AB  - A gram-positive bacterial expression vector using Streptococcus gordonii has been developed for expression and secretion, or surface anchoring of heterologous proteins. This system, termed Surface Protein Expression system or SPEX, has been used to express a variety of surface anchored and secreted proteins. In this study, the Mycobacterium xenopi (Mxe) GyrA intein and chitin binding domain from Bacillus circulans chitinase Al were used in conjunction with SPEX to express a fusion protein to facilitate secretion, cleavage, and purification. Streptococcus gordonii was transformed to express a secreted fusion protein consisting of a target protein with a C-terminal intein and chitin-binding domain. Two target proteins, the C-repeat region of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein (M6) and the nuclease A (NucA) enzyme of Staphylococcus aureus, were expressed and tested for intein cleavage. The secreted fusion proteins were purified from culture medium by binding to chitin beads and subjected to reaction conditions to induce intein self-cleavage to release the target protein. The M6 and NucA fusion proteins were shown to bind chitin beads and elute under cleavage reaction conditions. In addition, NucA demonstrated enzyme activity both before and after intein cleavage.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-773, a new ketolide, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - ABT-773 is a novel ketolide effective against antibacterial-resistant respiratory tract pathogens. The pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-773 was studied in rats and consisted of a mean peak concentration in plasma of 1.07 microg/ml and an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 12.03 microg. h/ml when the compound was delivered at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight. It concentrated in rat lung tissue, with a lung tissue-to-plasma ratio of 29 based on the AUC. In acute systemic infections in mice, ABT-773 showed efficacy against macrolide-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Listeria monocytogenes. Additionally, ABT-773 improved the survival of mice infected with resistant S. pneumoniae containing either the ermB gene, the mefE gene, or altered penicillin binding protein genes. In a rat lung model of infection, ABT-773 demonstrated 50% effective doses lower than those of comparator macrolides when evaluated against the following strains of S. pneumoniae: a macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-susceptible strain, an ermB strain, and an mefE strain. ABT-773 was also effective against Haemophilus influenzae lung infections in rats. Thus, ABT-773 may prove to be a useful new antibacterial agent for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Correlation of MIC methods and tentative interpretive criteria for disk diffusion susceptibility testing using NCCLS methodology for fusidic acid.
AB  - Three hundred and eight staphylococci and 43 Streptococcus pyogenes were tested by agar dilution, microbroth dilution, E-test, and disk diffusion using 5, 10 and 50 microg disks, as outlined by the NCCLS, in order to correlate the different MIC methods and to establish tentative species specific interpretive zone diameter breakpoints for fusidic acid. MIC results of the three methods were comparable. For Staphylococcus aureus, using MIC breakpoints of < or = 0.5 mg/L for susceptible and > or = 2 mg/L for resistant tentative interpretive zone diameters of > or = 20 mm and > or = 21 mm for susceptible and < or = 17 mm and < or = 18 mm for resistant are suggested for the 5 microg and the 10 microg disk, respectively. The 50 microg disk did not separate susceptible from resistant isolates. For streptococci a uniform MIC distribution of 2-8 mg/L was found.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Nocardiosis in South Texas children.
AB  - Primary cutaneous nocardiosis can present as cellulitis or abscess with or without lymphadenitis. In South Texas children with suspected Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes skin and soft tissue infections who do not improve as expected with appropriate antibiotics, physicians should consider Nocardia brasiliensis in the differential diagnosis, especially if there are multiple lesions in a lymphocutaneous distribution.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Polymicrobial polyarticular septic arthritis: a rare clinical entity.
AB  - Polymicrobial polyarticular septic arthritis is a rare clinical entity, with only a few cases having been reported to date. We report a case due to Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in an IVDU, complicated by fatal streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome, and review the current literature. We conclude that whenever polymicrobial polyarticular septic arthritis is diagnosed, a high index of suspicion should be maintained for the detection of locally destructive infectious processes as well as systemic complications, and that a high mortality rate should be expected.
TI  - Of staphs, streps and other things.

TI  - [Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (Zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  - Azithromycin (Zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in Japan in March 2000. It showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Its activity against H. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. After oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. Its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of S. aureus. In experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.
TI  - Superantigen antagonist blocks Th1 cytokine gene induction and lethal shock.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens trigger an excessive, Th1-cytokine response leading to toxic shock. We designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits SEB-induced expression of human genes for IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-beta, cytokines that mediate shock. The peptide antagonist shows homology to a beta-strand-hinge-alpha-helix domain that is conserved structurally in superantigens produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class II molecule and T-cell receptor. For Th1-cell activation, superantigens depend on this domain. The peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with SEB or SEA. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Surviving mice rapidly developed broad-spectrum, protective immunity, which rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges with different staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens. Thus, the lethal effect of superantigens, mediated by Th1 cytokines, can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade, before activation of T cells takes place.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ABT-773, a novel antibacterial ketolide.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ABT-773, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were compared. ABT-773 was the most active compound against macrolide-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. It also had good activity against gram-negative and atypical respiratory tract pathogens and Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - The influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine T.
AB  - The phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of N-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine T for comparison. Chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (N-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine T: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). Killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in Staphylococcus aureus. With chloramine T, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. The chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of activated C-H compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of N-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. The initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. The increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal N-chloro compounds by which the loss of N-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate and thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate and other antimicrobials against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate (TGA; CAS 20192-91-0) is widely used for the treatment of infections of varied aetiology. The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate (TG; CAS 15318-45-3), TGA, amoxicillin (CAS 61336-70-7) plus clavulanic acid (CAS 58001-44-8), azithromycin (CAS 83905-01-5) and ceftriaxone (CAS 104376-79-6). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods. The effects of changes in assay conditions were also examined. The activity of TG and TGA was similar to that of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, with the exception of methicillin resistant S. aureus. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were characterised by a limited activity against gram-positive cocci and methicillin resistant and cefinase-positive S. aureus, respectively. TG and TGA are characterized by a wide spectrum of activity, comparable to that of recent commercialized antibiotics for treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. For most essential oils examined, H. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and then S. aureus. Penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. Escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. A minimal inhibitory dose (MID) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. Among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest MID, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. The essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high MIDS. The vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. The vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.
TI  - [Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. Several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein M and capsulae. Streptolysin O and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. Toxins A and C act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. Capsule, protein A, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. In infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group A streptococci are Peptostreptococcus magnus, oral Prevotella, Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located next to the perineal area. Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal infections. However benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. Since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci and anaerobes. In some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. The efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ failure.
TI  - [Erysipelas: microbiological and pathogenic data].
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is considered as the primary cause of erysipelas and the virulence factors of this species are reviewed. The role of Staphylococcus aureus alone or associated with Streptococcus pyogenes remains unclear. Other etiologies are infrequent. Several techniques were used to detect bacteria (direct examination, culture, antigen or genome assay) in local samples (needle aspiration, swab.), in others sites (throat, blood cultures), or specific antibodies. The performance of the various diagnosis methods is evaluated. Despite the combination of 2 or more methods, the etiology remains unknown in almost 20 p. 100 of the cases.
TI  - Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. METHODS: Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). RESULTS: Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on dermatophyte fungi, Candida and bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: Nitric oxide is generated from sweat nitrite in the acidic environment of the skin surface and is thought to contribute to protection against infection. This study examined the sensitivity of Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes to acidified nitrite. METHODS AND RESULTS: Organisms were cultured in varying concentrations of nitrite and pH for different lengths of time, before being transferred to recovery medium. With the exception of Strep. pyogenes, addition of nitrite increased the antimicrobial activity of acid solutions against all organisms tested. The rank order of sensitivity was: C. albicans < T. rubrum < T. mentagrophytes < Staph. aureus < P. acnes, with P. acnes being most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This work has shown that acidified nitrite is microbiocidal to common cutaneous pathogens. The concentrations of nitrite required to kill pathogenic fungi and bacteria in in vitro assays were higher than the concentrations of nitrite measured in sweat. However, additional co-factors in vivo and in sweat may potentiate the effect of acidified nitrite. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pharmacological preparations of acidified nitrite are novel antimicrobial agents. These data suggest skin organisms which may be sensitive to this treatment.
TI  - Superantigen antagonist peptides.
AB  - The production of superantigenic exotoxins by Gram positive bacteria underlies the pathology of toxic shock syndrome. Future treatment strategies for superantigen-mediated diseases are likely to be directed at blocking the three-way interaction between superantigen, T cell receptor and major histocompatibility class II molecule, which inititates an excessive and disordered inflammatory response. In this article, we review the first published data to address one such strategy in the context of other recognised and experimental treatments.
TI  - "Cloud" health-care workers.
AB  - Certain bacteria dispersed by health-care workers can cause hospital infections.  Asymptomatic health-care workers colonized rectally, vaginally, or on the skin with group A streptococci have caused outbreaks of surgical site infection by airborne dispersal. Outbreaks have been associated with skin colonization or viral upper respiratory tract infection in a phenomenon of airborne dispersal of Staphylococcus aureus called the "cloud" phenomenon. This review summarizes the data supporting the existence of cloud health-care workers.
TI  - Complications of varicella in children: emphasis on skin and central nervous system disorders.
AB  - A review of medical records at a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan from June 1988 through May 1998 identified 136 children who had been hospitalized for varicella-related complications. Of the children, 83% (113/136) were healthy before the onset of varicella and 17% (23/136) had underlying illnesses. The mean age was 4.7 years (ranged from 1 day to 18 years) with a male predominance (1.7:1). The mean hospital stay was 5.5 days (ranged from 1 to 22 days). Secondary bacterial skin or soft tissue infections were the most common complications (44%), followed by central nervous system (CNS) involvement (23%), pneumonia (18%), thrombocytopenia (12%), and liver function impairment (10%). Among the 60 patients with secondary bacterial cutaneous infection, 16 (27%) had positive isolates, including 12 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and four Streptococcus pyogenes. Age above 8 years was significantly associated with the development of varicella-associated CNS complications (p = 0.019). Of the 23 immunocompromised hosts, the most common underlying conditions were hematological diseases (11 patients, 48%), followed by neonatal varicella (7 patients, 30%) and chronic illness with steroid treatment (5 patients, 22%). All of the subjects in this study had a favorable outcome except for three lethal cases, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 2.2%. The cause of death was S. aureus septicemia in one patient, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in one patient, and encephalitis with brain herniation in one patient. Our results demonstrate that varicella continues to be a serious disease that occasionally results in life-threatening complications in healthy and immunocompromised children. Routine immunization of all healthy children against varicella is recommended.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes photosensitizers and light. Whereas PDT use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial PDT (APDT) is still in its early stages of development. OBJECTIVES: To study microbial killing in vitro using APDT. METHODS: We used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. Using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mW cm(-2)) and methylene blue dye at 100 microg mL(-1), kill rates and subsequent D-values were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: D-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. The effects of light intensity on the killing of S. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. A high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that APDT of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: steps to reduce the problem with emphasis on antibiotic utilization the Rapid City experience.
AB  - In summary, as the SHEA/IDSA Joint Committee on Prevention of Antimicrobial Resistance suggested, it should be easier to prevent the acquisition of resistance than to respond after the problem is extensive. We have taken that approach in the measures undertaken and outlined above. Our lower rates of resistant microorganisms are, in part, due to this, but also due to the diligent use of antibiotics by the medical staff-largely in avoiding empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy when not needed. Our formulary is not restrictive but new antibiotics are not added unless there is a proven niche. The most appropriate and effective antibiotic at our hospital for Streptococcus pneumoniae is penicillin, for Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin, for Staphylococcus aureus, nafcillin, for a severe Escherichia Coli infection, gentamicin, and for Pseudomonas aeurginosa, gentamicin and ceftazidime. Our efforts are to maintain this favorable situation for our patients and clinicians. Additionally, we will continue to explore and implement new avenues of prevention, with an emphasis on optimal antibiotic utilization, toward the goal of protecting our patients and health care workers from resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comparative chemotherapeutic efficacy of balhimycin, desgluco-balhimycin against  experimental MSSA and MRSA infection in mice.
AB  - Balhimycin and desglucobalhimycin are glycopeptide antibiotics isolated from an Amycolatopsis spp during the search for novel antibacterials against MRSA from the natural product screening at the Research Centre of formerly Hoechst India Ltd. in Bombay, India. Both compounds show excellent in vitro activity against methicillin sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA). Both compounds were also found to be active against a number of MRSA strain in the animal studies. The activities were comparable to that of the reference glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin used in these studies. Teicoplanin displayed better in vivo efficacy against S. epidermidis 4929H and Streptococcus pyogenes A77 than either vancomycin or desgluco-balhimycin in the present study. Preliminary studies on pharmacokinetic and acute toxicity were done to get some idea at the early stage of the investigation about the promise of the compounds for development.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial activity of essential oils of several Macedonian Thymus L. species (Lamiaceae).
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of twenty specimens of essential oils of eleven Thymus species, naturally occurring in the Macedonian flora, was investigated by agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. Inhibition of growth and microbicidal action was examined on three Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In spite of wide variability in essential oil composition, ranging from traces of thymol to the amount of about 50% thymol in oils, all examined samples of Thymus essential oil possessed strong antibacterial activity. Zones of inhibition of growth (for 25% dilution of oils) was from 10-54 mm in diameters. MICs ranging from 0.012-0.1% while MMCs were from 0.025-0.4% for essential oils that contained large amounts of phenols and 0.2-1.6% for those which contained traces of phenols and large amounts of geraniol, linalool and (Z + E)-citral.
TI  - In vitro development of resistance to six quinolones in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were exposed to subinhibitory MICs of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, clinafloxacin, and gemifloxacin during a 10-day period. Subculturing led to resistance development, regardless of the initial potencies of the quinolones. None of the quinolones was associated with a significantly slower rate of resistance development.
TI  - Expression of the major heat shock proteins DnaK and GroEL in Streptococcus pyogenes: a comparison to Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - One of the outstanding problems in the field of heat shock response has been to elucidate the mechanism underlying the induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this work, we initiate an analysis of the expression of heat shock groEL and dnaK genes and their promoters in S. pyogenes. The synthesis of total cellular proteins was studied upon transfer of a log-phase culture from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C by performing 5-min pulse-labeling experiments with (35)S-Met. The heat shock responses in the pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, were also analyzed.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of peptidyl derivatives and cyclopeptides  structurally based upon the inhibitory centre of human cystatin C. Dissociation of antiproteolytic and antibacterial effects.
AB  - Cysteine protease-inhibiting proteins of the cystatin superfamily can inhibit the replication of certain viruses and bacteria. The inhibitory centre of human cystatin C, the most widely distributed human cystatin, comprises three peptide segments. The present work describes the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 27 new peptidyl derivatives or cyclopeptides based upon the aminoterminal segment Arg8-Leu9-Val10-Gly11. Fourteen of the new compounds displayed antibacterial activity against from 1 up to 9 of 17 clinically important bacterial species tested. Antiproteolytic activity of a compound was usually not required for its antibacterial capacity. Peptidyl diazomethanes generally had a very narrow antibacterial spectrum, inhibiting only Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas cyclopeptides and peptidyl derivatives of the general structure X-Arg-Leu-NH-CH(iPr)-CH2-NH-Y had a much wider spectrum. The most potent of these substances displayed approximately equal minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 20 microg/ml for both Staphylococcus aureus and S. pyogenes and were devoid of antiproteolytic activity. Several of the new substances could protect mice against lethal intraperitoneal challenge with S. pyogenes. Though their target remains to be disclosed, the group of substances here reported might be promising for the development of antibacterial drugs and the discovery of novel principles of action.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - [Orbital and periorbital cellulitis. Review of 107 cases].
AB  - AIM: To report the epidemiology, clinical features, management and complications  of orbital and periorbital cellulitis; to evaluate the use of imaging tests in the detection of complications. METHODS: Retrospective study of 107 pediatric patients admitted to the San Joan de Deu Pediatric Hospital with orbital or periorbital cellulitis from January 1991 to January 1999. RESULTS: The incidence of cellulitis was highest in the second year of life and during winter. No significant differences were found between the sexes. In 68 patients (63.6%) the cause of cellulitis was identified as sinusitis. The most frequently identified organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Computed tomography identified retroseptal damage in 36 patients with 23 super osteal abscesses, 3 orbital abscesses and 3 intracranial complications. Sixty nine percent of the patients were treated with a single antibiotic (cefotaxime, cefuroxime or amoxicillin clavulanic acid) while 31% underwent multiple antibiotic therapy. Only 8.4% required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital cellulitis is a relatively common and potentially serious disease in children. The early use of CT to assess the extent of damage is important in establishing prognosis and in assessing the need for surgical therapy.
TI  - Cefdinir: an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of cefdinir, an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-November 1999) of the medical literature, review of English-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and product information. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir was also reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cefdinir, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and -positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. Cefdinir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse event profile is similar to that of comparator agents. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir is a second-line alternative to first-line antimicrobial agents, with convenient once- or twice-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and policy in Belgium.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in Belgium. A few examples to illustrate this problem: S. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming more and more resistant to the fluoroquinolones. In hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the Belgian hospitals. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. The popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". Infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. In this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. We will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens Salmonella and Campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen E. coli. This resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. In Belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. Our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. This information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. A unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. However, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. Therefore, a Coordination Commission for Antibiotic Policy was installed recently by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Public Health and Agriculture.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of tea in vitro and in vivo (in patients with impetigo contagiosa).
AB  - A total number of 104 patients with impetigo contagiosa was included in this study. They were 47 females (45.2%) and 57 males (54.8%). Their ages ranged from one month to 40 years with a median of 4 years. This study was divided into two parts: PART I (in vitro): Thirty-five patients were swabbed to determine the microbiology of impetigo contagiosa which included 33 isolates of pure S. aureus (94.3%) and 2 of a combination of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (5.7%). The antibacterial effect of tea liquor (lotion) against S. aureus proved very effective. Antibiotic sensitivity was done for all bacterial isolates of S. aureus. PART II (in vivo): The antibacterial effects of tea liquor and ointment were tested by treating 64 patients with impetigo contagiosa. Tea ointment was very effective with a cure rate of 81.3%. Forty patients were taken as controls and divided into two groups. The first one was given an ointment containing Framycetin and gramicidin (soframycin) with a cure rate of 72.2%; the other group was given oral cephalexin with a cure rate of 78.6%. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first one which demonstrated the anti-bacterial action of crude tea in vivo, against impetigo contagiosa. Clinical data about impetigo are also included in this study.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the culture fluid of Lentinus edodes mycelium grown in submerged liquid culture.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the culture fluid of Lentinus edodes mycelium grown in submerged liquid culture was tested against some common bacterial species and Candida albicans. The mycelium-free culture fluid was bacteriostatic against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus megaterium. The substance responsible for the activity was heat-stable, could be extracted with chloroform and had a molecular weight under 10000. These characteristics suggested that the component might be lenthionine, an antibacterial and antifungal sulphur-containing compound. The culture fluid was less toxic to human tissue culture cells than to microbes. The antibacterial activity and toxicity could not be attributed to the same component.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  - Eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. The results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. The extracts from Gnaphalium oxyphyllum, Gnaphalium americanum, and Crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.
TI  - Skin disease presenting as an outbreak of pseudobacteremia in a laboratory worker.
AB  - An outbreak of pseudobacteremia due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) was traced to the venting procedure for aerobic bottles prior to their loading into the incubator of the BacT/Alert analyzer (Organon Teknika). Bacteria shed by a laboratory worker suffering from impetigo and cellulitis contaminated the aerobic bottles of 10 patients. All blood culture isolates, in addition to the isolates from the laboratory worker, were of the same GAS M and T types. All MSSA isolates from blood cultures and the index case's hands had the same lytic phage profile. Procedural breakdowns were identified in the laboratory. Bottles were vented outside the biological safety cabinet, gloves were not worn, and unprotected needles were used for the venting procedure. The source of the aspirated bacteria that contaminated the bottles was identified and the index case was treated promptly.
TI  - Group A streptococcal growth phase-associated virulence factor regulation by a novel operon (Fas) with homologies to two-component-type regulators requires a small RNA molecule.
AB  - A novel growth phase-associated two-component-type regulator, Fas (fibronectin/fibrinogen binding/haemolytic activity/streptokinase regulator), of Streptococcus pyogenes was identified in the M1 genome sequence, based on homologies to the histidine protein kinase (HPK) and response regulator (RR) part of the Staphylococcus aureus Agr and Streptococcus pneumoniae Com quorum-sensing systems. The fas operon, present in all 12 tested M serotypes, was transcribed as polycystronic message (fasBCA) and contained genes encoding two potential HPKs (FasB and FasC) and one RR (FasA). Downstream of fasBCA, we identified a small 300 nucleotide monocistronic transcript, designated fasX, that did not appear to encode true peptide sequences. Measurements of luciferase promoter fusions revealed a growth phase-associated transcription of fasBCA and fasX, with peak activities during the late exponential phase. Insertional mutagenesis disrupting fasBCA and fasA led to a phenotype similar to agr-null mutations in S. aureus, with prolonged expression of extracellular matrix protein-binding adhesins and reduced expression of secreted virulence factors such as streptokinase and streptolysin S. In addition, fasX transcription was dependent on the RR FasA; however, deletion mutagenesis of fasX resulted in a similar phenotype to that of the fasBCA or fasA mutants. Complementation of the fasX deletion mutant, with the fasX gene expressed in trans from a plasmid, restored the wild-type fasBCA regulation pattern. This strongly suggested that fasX, a putative non-translated RNA, is the main effector molecule of the fas regulon. However, using spent culture supernatants from wild-type and fas mutant strains, we were not able to show an influence on the logarithmic growth phase expression of fas and dependent genes. Thus, despite structural and functional similarities between fas and agr, to date the fas operon appears not to be involved in group A streptococcal (GAS) quorum-sensing regulation.
TI  - Recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences.
AB  - The identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. We have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. For Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. The lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for Strep. pyogenes). In contrast, gene trees constructed for Hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of recombination. The impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.
TI  - [Personal experience with use of the antimicrobial agent, Neloren R, in maxillofacial surgery].
AB  - During the treatment of sick as well as injured and operated patients it was used the therapy according to the clinical experience of doctors and possibility of the choice of some antibiotic. It was used the therapy according to antibiogram whenever it was possible. In the study the results of using of Neloren-antibiotic, linkomicin, produced in "Bosnalijek" Sarajevo, were followed up comparing to the other antibiotics. Neloren effects on Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus penumoniae, S. viridian's, Staphylococcus aureus (resistant on Penicillin), Corynebacterium diphteriae, Bacillus anthracis Bateroides fragilis, Rikecia prowaseki and some dostridiaes. In developing of the study the patients were involved who had bone fracture caused by influence of different exogene ethiological factors and the patients with benign pathological process in bone structure, the most often osteomyelitis or abscess caused by dentogene source as well as the patients who were treated by functional or corrective aesthetic operations such as osteoplastic of jaw or correction of bone deformation. The results were shown by chart and graphic representation and they will be compared to the results around the world.
TI  - Structural evidence for the evolution of pyrogenic toxin superantigens.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria have evolved a wide variety of toxins to invade and attack host organisms. In particular, strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes produce a family of pyrogenic toxin superantigens (PTSAgs) that can cause illness, e.g., toxic shock syndrome, or synergize with a number of other immune system disorders. The PTSAgs are all similar in size and have a conserved two-domain tertiary fold despite minimal amino acid sequence identity. The tertiary structure of PTSAg domain 1 is similar to the immunoglobulin binding motif of streptococcal proteins G and L. PTSAg domain 2 resembles members of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold family that includes the B subunits of the AB(5) heat-labile enterotoxins, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, and verotoxin. The strong structural homology between the pyrogenic toxins and other bacterial proteins suggests that the PTSAgs evolved through the recombination of two smaller beta-strand motifs.
TI  - A century of the synthesis of dapsone: its anti-infective capacity now and then.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although dapsone was first synthesized in 1908, a quarter of a century was to pass before it was used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Dapsone was, however, too toxic for humans (because of the excess dosage which was administered at that time) and was thus considered to be of no value in the treatment of common bacterial infections. Since the early 1950s, dapsone has been recognized as being uniquely effective against a number of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases and, today, this is its main indication. Thus, the reason why dapsone was first introduced into medicine, namely the treatment of bacterial infections, has been set aside and its main current applications are the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and bullous diseases. OBJECTIVE: To study the anti-infective capacity of dapsone against common bacterial infections. As many patients who receive dapsone for the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases have a concomitant bacterial infection or a superinfection of their skin disease, we thought that, if dapsone proved to be effective against common bacterial infections, it may obviate the need for an additional antimicrobial drug in these patients. METHODS: Three bacterial ATCC> strains (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli) were tested by a macrodilution minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test for dapsone. Dapsone concentrations were between 0.06 and 1125 microg/mL. RESULTS: Even the highest concentration of dapsone of 1125 microg/mL did not inhibit bacterial growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that dapsone has no antibacterial effects whatsoever. Even at very high concentrations, it does not suppress the growth of most susceptible strains of bacteria. The story of dapsone (i.e. the long time that elapsed between its synthesis to its use for the chemotherapy of infectious diseases) will not repeat itself this time.
TI  - Immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'Dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  - The immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. In this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. A long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. The influence of orally given Dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. A two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. In immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, IgG) and coproantibodies (predominantly, S-IgA) determined by ELISA, has been found. The results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation D, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - Presentation and clinical features of severe sepsis.

TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - A review of antimicrobial resistance in Canada.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past 10 years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. This review summarizes our current understanding of bacterial antimicrobial resistance issues in Canada with particular emphasis given to the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, future concerns and programs for ongoing surveillance are discussed.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin(BAY 12-8039) against respiratory tract pathogens from six Latin-American countries.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin (BAY 12-8039) was evaluated against 636 isolates of respiratory tract pathogens. The isolates were collected from July 1997 to August 1998 in the frame of a multinational Latin American study. E-test strips calibrated to read moxifloxacin MIC ranges from 0.002 to 32 microg/ml were used in susceptibility testing. Weekly quality control tests in each laboratory ensured reproducibility. Laboratories from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay participated. MIC(90) for moxifloxacin were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (304 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml, Haemophilus influenzae (135 isolates) 0.125 microg/ ml, Streptococcus pyogenes (66 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml, Moraxella catarrhalis (62 isolates) 0. 25 microg/ml and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (69 isolates) 0.25 microg/ml. These results agreed with reports from other areas. Moxifloxacin showed excellent activity against respiratory pathogens from participant countries.
TI  - Evidence for the involvement of bacterial superantigens in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and Kawasaki syndrome.
AB  - A growing body of evidence implicates streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens in the development of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and Kawasaki syndrome. In each of these illnesses, an abnormal state of immunologic activity is observed. Superantigens, which have a unique ability to activate large numbers of lymphocytes, are likely to contribute to these disorders in a number of ways. The demonstrated activities of bacterial superantigens include increasing the number of circulating lymphocytes, with activation of autoreactive subsets, upregulation of tissue homing receptors on circulating lymphocytes, and local activation of immune cells within affected tissues. Through these and other mechanisms, superantigens have a proven ability to induce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and/or initiate autoimmune responses that contribute to the development of skin and vascular disorders. Though development of the illnesses discussed in this review are highly complex processes, superantigens may well play a critical role in their onset or maintenance. Understanding superantigen function may elucidate potential therapeutic strategies for these disorders.
TI  - Expression and purification of histidine-tagged proteins from the gram-positive Streptococcus gordonii SPEX system.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) has been used as a gram-positive bacterial expression vector for secreted or surface-anchored recombinant proteins. Fusion of the gram-positive bacterial N-terminal signal sequence to the target protein is all that is required for efficient export. This system is termed SPEX for Surface Protein EXpression and has been used to express proteins for a variety of uses. In this study, the SPEX system has been further developed by the construction of vectors that express polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. SPEX vectors were constructed with an N-terminal or C-terminal histidine tag. The C-repeat region (CRR) from Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein and the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease A (NucA) enzyme were tested for expression. The fusion proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography (MAC). Results show that the fusion proteins were expressed and secreted from S. gordonii with the His tag at either the N- or C-terminal position and could be purified using MAC. The M6 fusions retained immunoreactivity after expression and purification as determined by immunoblots and ELISA analyses. In addition, NucA fusions retained functional activity after MAC purification. The M6-His and NucA-His fusions were purified approximately 15- and 10-fold respectively with approximately 30% recovery of protein using MAC. This study shows that the polyhistidine tag in either the N- or C-terminal position is a viable way to purify secreted heterologous proteins from the supernatant of recombinant S. gordonii cultures. This study further illustrates the value of the SPEX system for secreted expression and purification of proteins.
TI  - Spinal instrumentation for primary pyogenic infection report of 31 patients.
AB  - The role of spinal instrumentation in the presence of infection is still controversial. Radical debridements of infected vertebrae and disc material and bone grafting usually leaves the spine unstable without some surgical stabilisation. We reviewed 31 cases of primary pyogenic spinal infection treated by radical debridement, bone grafting and posterior (30) or anterior (1) spinal instrumentation. The indication for surgery was the failure of conservative treatment (8), progressive neurological deficit (19) or the lack of diagnosis (3). The clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were assessed pre and postoperatively. The mean period of follow-up was 3.8 years (1-12 years). The neurological deficit was progressive in 19 patients, following surgery all these patients were improved. The neurological deficit was established in one patient; following surgery, his neurological deficit did not improve. The infection was eradicated in all our patients. The following complications were encountered: (1) three patients developed deep wound infection, which responded to repeated debridement; (2) one death resulted from nosocomial septicaemia, (3) reoperation was carried out on one patient for implant failure and on another for a dislodged anterior bone graft. We conclude that spinal instrumentation may be indicated when after radical debridement of infected vertebrae and disc material and bone grafting the stability of the spine is still compromised. According to the location of the infection and the availability of suitable implants, anterior or posterior instrumentation may be necessary. With appropriate antimicrobial agents, the outcome has been satisfactory in our patients.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical site infections and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study post surgical infections and sensitivity of the Isolates so that recommendations can be made for their prevention and empirical antibiotic treatment. SETTING: Swabs/pus specimens from the patients developing surgical site infections at PNS Shifa, Karachi were processed in the Department of Pathology during January, 1998 to September, 1999. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine swabs/pus specimens from various types of surgical sites suspected to be infected on clinical grounds were processed, by standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the isolates was done by using Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the one hundred and fifty-three organisms isolated, the most common was Staphylococcus aureus (50.32%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), Escherichia coli (14.37%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.76%), miscellaneous gram negative rods (5.88%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.30%). About 50% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. In case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli more than 60% of the isolates were found resistant to Gentamicin. The resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone ciprofloxacin was also quite high. Other isolates also showed a very high level of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: In addition to the economic burden for antibiotic treatment, such infections for multi-resistant organisms are a serious threat to our surgical patients. To prevent these happenings, there is an urgent need to adopt basic principles of asepsis and sterilisation and to make judicious use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin compared to those of seven agents against bacteria recovered from outpatients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone and clarithromycin was evaluated against 173 S. pneumoniae strains (128, penicillin-susceptible strains; 32, intermediate penicillin- resistant strains and 13, penicillin-resistant strains), 163 H. influenzae strains (128, beta-lactamase non-producer; 35, beta-lactamase producers), 111 M. catarrhalis (9, beta-lactamase non-producer; 102, beta-lactamase producers), 95 Streptococcus pyogenes and 116 S. aureus strains (96, methicillin-susceptible; 20, methicillin-resistant) recovered from outpatients with respiratory tract infection. Based upon the MICs at which 50% and 90% of the isolates were inhibited we concluded that gatifloxacin proved to be the most active antibiotic against respiratory pathogens, including all the penicillin-resistant pneumococci and H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis producing beta-lactamase. Furthermore, their MICs against S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were lower than those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.Therefore, this new fluoroquinolone displayed in vitro features that make it suitable for treating community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Soft tissue and muscular infections (including group A streptococci).
AB  - Skin, soft tissue and muscular infections are very common and can progress to induce serious life-threatening local and systemic complications. They often occur in sites that have been compromised or injured by foreign bodies, trauma, ischaemia, malignancy or surgery. In addition to group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, the indigenous local microflora is usually responsible for these infections. Anatomical sites that are subject to faecal or oral contamination are particularly at risk. The early recognition and proper medical and surgical management of these infections are of primary importance.
TI  - Micro-organisms responsible for osteo-articular infections.
AB  - Identification of the aetiological agents responsible for bone and joint infections requires either hard to obtain specimens that are easy to interpret, or easy to obtain specimens of difficult interpretation. Isolates obtained by blood cultures, arthrocentesis, or trephine or surgical biopsy bone samples are usually clinically significant. In contrast, samples obtained from sinus tracts or through open wounds are very often easy to obtain but difficult to interpret. Micro-organisms such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common cause of infections around prosthetic joint materials but are usually of little significance when obtained from the sinus tract of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia without osteosynthesis. Other micro-organisms to be interpreted with caution include Corynebacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. The most important families of antimicrobial agents and their utility in bone and joint infections are briefly reviewed at the end of the chapter. Bone and joint infections require long-term antimicrobial therapy based on the correct diagnosis and the appropriate selection of antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of bacterial superantigens and antibodies against them in human plasma.
AB  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the quantitation of bacterial superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B and C, toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, were developed. The assays had sensitivity to quantitate these toxins to 1.4, 5.9, 16.3, 2.5 and 4.3 pg/ml, respectively, in a buffer including 50% human plasma. It takes only 150 min to complete the assays after plate preparation. Specificity of the assays agreed with those of reverse latex agglutination assay. We also developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect antibodies against these five superantigens. The assays are expected to be significant tools for the study of superantigens in several diseases.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, resistance of Gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. New antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. We conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. RESULTS: All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S aureus. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. The MIC90s were 1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes and viridans streptococci. Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. H influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. B catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and B catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against H influenzae.
TI  - Bacteriology of the tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hyperplasia--a short review.
AB  - In recurrent tonsillitis, the tonsil core harbours numerous bacteria, some of which are pathogenic and may occur in great numbers. The most frequent bacteria are Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A high tissue concentration of these bacteria correlates with clinical parameters of infection and hyperplasia of the tonsils. The role of Streptococcus pyogenes, while undisputed in acute and epidemic tonsillitis, should perhaps be re-evaluated in recurrent and/or hyperplastic tonsillitis.
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Musculoskeletal infections in intravenous drug addicts: report of 34 cases with analysis of microbiological aspects and pathogenic mechanisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in Spanish intravenous (i.v.) drug addicts. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 34 medical records was carried out and the aetiologic agent was confirmed in all cases. RESULTS: The mean age was 26 years and the sex ratio was 25M/9F. Twenty-four patients were HIV-positive and 10 HIV-negative. There were no differences between the 2 subgroups. Septic arthritis, seen in 27 cases (79%), was the most common type of infection. Axial involvement was present in 23 cases (67%). The organisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus (25 cases), Candida albicans (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 cases), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes in one case each. Candida albicans affected the sternocostal joints. Laboratory data showed non-specific findings. The outcome was mostly good and only one patient died. CONCLUSION: Human immunodeficiency virus does not affect characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in i.v. drug addicts. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated pathogen in this population.
TI  - Efficacy and potential clinical applications of Pentaglobin, an IgM-enriched immunoglobulin concentrate suitable for intravenous infusion.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Characterisation of the antibodies against important human pathogens in two immunoglobulin preparations: Intraglobin F and IgM-enriched Pentaglobin. DESIGN: In vitro assay of antibody titre using bacterial outer-membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and exotoxins of clinically relevant bacteria. METHODS: Antibody reactivities measured by ELISA and immunoblot techniques against antigens from bacteria that cause sepsis, antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and enteric pathogens. RESULTS: IgG anti-LPS reactivity was present in both study drugs. Specific IgM antibodies against LPS of gram-negative bacteria that cause sepsis were also detected in the IgM-enriched Pentaglobin. IgG-reactivity against gram-positive multiresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were detectable in both preparations. IgG and IgM antibodies present against Yersinia outer proteins and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) outer membrane proteins were detected in Pentaglobin. Both preparations reacted against alpha toxin of S. aureus and streptolysin of Streptococcus pyogenes. Pentaglobin showed a strong IgM-reactivity against alpha-haemolysin. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that infusion of well characterised immunoglobulin preparations might be beneficial for patients with severe infections. This is highly relevant in view of the high pathogenicity of bacteria that cause infections in patients in hospital and the continually increasing antibiotic resistance (particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus).
TI  - [National Multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens]
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: reports of three fatal cases simulating and resulting from assaults.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a progressive, potentially fatal, rapid, necrotizing infection of the subcutaneous tissues and fascia often caused by a mixture of organisms or by infection with group A Streptococcus pyogenes with or without Staphylococcus aureus. Three cases are presented that have been encountered in forensic pathologic practice. Two cases presented after assaults, and the third simulated an assault and burglary. The history, scene, and pathologic findings are presented with a brief review of the literature.
TI  - [Multilocus sequencing--a new method of genotyping bacteria and first results of  its use].
AB  - Comparative characterization (molecular typing) of isolates within a bacterial species is one of the major problems in microbiology and epidemiology. However, it is rather difficult to correlate data obtained in various laboratories, because traditional, including molecular, methods employed in typing pathogenic microorganisms cannot be standardized. In 1998, Maiden et al. proposed multilocus sequence typing (MLST); through which alleles of several housekeeping genes are directly assessed by nucleotide sequencing, each unique allele combination determining a sequence type of a strain. The advantages of this approach are that the culturing of pathogenic microorganisms is avoided, as their gene fragments are amplified directly from biological samples, and that the sequencing data are unambiguous, easy to standardize, and electronically portable. The latter makes it possible to generate an expandable global database for each species at an Internet site, in order to use it for the purposes of genotyping pathogenic bacteria (and other infectious agents). MLST protocols have been elaborated for Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori; those for Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae are now being developed. Basic principles and the first results of MLST have been reviewed, including data on the distribution and microevolution of N. meningitidis clones causing epidemic meningococcal infection, the relative recombination and mutation rates in the N. meningitidis genome, the identification of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae clones causing severe generalized infection, the grouping of H. pylori isolates from various geographic regions, etc.
TI  - Conservation and variation in superantigen structure and activity highlighted by  the three-dimensional structures of two new superantigens from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens (SAgs) are a structurally related group of protein toxins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. They are implicated in a range of human pathologies associated with bacterial infection whose symptoms result from SAg-mediated stimulation of a large number (2-20%) of T-cells. At the molecular level, bacterial SAgs bind to major histocompatability class II (MHC-II) molecules and disrupt the normal interaction between MHC-II and T-cell receptors (TCRs). We have determined high-resolution crystal structures of two newly identified streptococcal superantigens, SPE-H and SMEZ-2. Both structures conform to the generic bacterial superantigen folding pattern, comprising an OB-fold N-terminal domain and a beta-grasp C-terminal domain. SPE-H and SMEZ-2 also display very similar zinc-binding sites on the outer concave surfaces of their C-terminal domains. Structural comparisons with other SAgs identify two structural sub-families. Sub-families are related by conserved core residues and demarcated by variable binding surfaces for MHC-II and TCR. SMEZ-2 is most closely related to the streptococcal SAg SPE-C, and together they constitute one structural sub-family. In contrast, SPE-H appears to be a hybrid whose N-terminal domain is most closely related to the SEB sub-family and whose C-terminal domain is most closely related to the SPE-C/SMEZ-2 sub-family. MHC-II binding for both SPE-H and SMEZ-2 is mediated by the zinc ion at their C-terminal face, whereas the generic N-terminal domain MHC-II binding site found on many SAgs appears not to be present. Structural comparisons provide evidence for variations in TCR binding between SPE-H, SMEZ-2 and other members of the SAg family; the extreme potency of SMEZ-2 (active at 10(-15) g ml-1 levels) is likely to be related to its TCR binding properties. The smez gene shows allelic variation that maps onto a considerable proportion of the protein surface. This allelic variation, coupled with the varied binding modes of SAgs to MHC-II and TCR, highlights the pressure on SAgs to avoid host immune defences.
TI  - Teat lesions and their relationship to intramammary infections on small-scale dairy farms in Kiambu district in Kenya.
AB  - Mammary gland quarters of 139 lactating dairy cows from small-scale dairy herds were examined visually and by palpation for teat lesions and by California mastitis test (CMT) and bacterial culture for subclinical mastitis. Teat lesions were observed in 97 teats. These included teat chaps (39.2%), teat papillomas (23.7%), teat erosions (22.7%), teat fistulae (5.1%), inverted teats (5.1%) and blocked teats (4.2%). According to the CMT, the prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 33.4% in all the mammary gland quarters, 71.0% in quarters with teat lesions and 24.5% in quarters without teat lesions. There was a significant (P < 0.01) association between teat lesions and the prevalence of subclinical mastitis. The mammary gland quarters with teat lesions were 7.2 times more likely to have a positive CMT (P < 0.01) and 5.6 times more likely to have bacterial organisms (P < 0.01) isolated from them than those without any teat lesions. The bacterial organisms most frequently isolated from the CMT-positive milk samples from both the mammary gland quarters with teat lesions and those without teat lesions were Staphylococcus aureus (50.0%), Streptococcus spp. (34.8%) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (6.2%).
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute febrile illness accompanied by watery diarrhea, sunburn rash, vomiting, hypotension, and multiple organ involvement. When it was initially recognized 20 years ago, TSS was primarily associated with menstruation. Since then, the frequency of menstrual TSS has decreased dramatically. Staphylococcus aureus is the cause of menstrual TSS and is also responsible for about half of all cases of nonmenstrual TSS. Since the late 1980s, Streptococcus pyogenes has been shown to cause a nonmenstrual TSS-like illness, with a higher mortality rate. The mechanism of TSS is attributable to bacterial endotoxins that impede the body's immune system and cause the release of cytokines, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. Early recognition and treatment of TSS are important factors in improving patient survival. Patients should be treated with parenteral antibiotics that are highly effective against staphylococci and streptococci. They should also receive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Some patients require intubation, dialysis, or immunoglobulin therapy.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (SB-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of Gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis) and Gram-positive wound infection resulting from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. Oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. Around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. In the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (P < 0.01) compared with no treatment. No comparator agent had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. Notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (P < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against E. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were inferior (P < 0.01) against P. mirabilis infection. In the S. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01). Results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (P > 0.05). Gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (P < 0.01). No comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against S. pyogenes or S. aureus infections. These data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of Gram-negative urinary tract infection and Gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta in children.
AB  - Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aorta is a rare disease in childhood. We report on  two cases which were diagnosed in an unselected general pediatric population within an 8-month period. The first case was a 16-month-old toddler with a normal cardiac history who presented with purulent pericarditis due to group A streptococcus and subsequent pseudoaneurysm formation of the ascending aorta while convalescing from varicella infection. The second case was a 14-year-old girl with a previously undiagnosed coarctation of the aorta who developed a Staphylococcus aureus aortitis in the dilated poststenotic segment with pseudoaneurysm formation and infiltration into the adjacent lung tissue. In both cases parenteral antibiotic therapy was administered over 10 and 4 days, respectively, followed by emergency surgery consisting of aneurysmectomy, coarctectomy (case 2), and in situ homograft implantation. Recovery was uneventful. In both cases early institution of a femorofemoral cardiopulmonary bypass prevented a fatal outcome despite intraoperative rupture of the pseudoaneurysm.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of growth of erythromycin A-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive bacteria by the ketolides telithromycin (HMR 3647) and HMR 3004.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of the ketolides telithromycin (HMR 3647) and HMR 3004 and analyzed the results using the sigmoid E(max) model. Mean maximum telithromycin PAEs against erythromycin A-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 3. 7, 8.9, and 9.7 h, respectively, while maximum PAEs for erythromycin A-resistant strains were much shorter. Mean maximum HMR 3004 PAEs were 3.2 to 4.4 h for all species.
TI  - Pyrogenic toxin superantigen site specificity in toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning in animals.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes express pyrogenic toxin superantigens (PTSAgs) that are associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and staphylococcal food poisoning (SFP). Most PTSAgs cause TSS in deep-tissue infections, whereas only TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1) is associated with menstrual, vaginal TSS. In contrast, SFP has been linked only with staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs). Because of the differential abilities of PTSAgs to cause systemic or localized symptoms in a site-dependent manner, the present study was undertaken to assess the toxins' abilities to cross mucosal barriers. The activity of three PTSAgs when delivered orally, vaginally, or intravenously to rabbits and orally to monkeys was investigated. TSST-1 induced shock via all three routes in rabbits. Although active when administered intravenously, SEC1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) did not cause symptoms when administered orally or vaginally. Only SEC1 induced emesis in the monkey feeding assay. TSST-1, albeit less stable than SEC1 and SPEA to pepsin, induced diarrhea in monkeys. Our results may explain the unique association of TSST-1 with menstrual TSS and why SPEA is only rarely associated with TSS after pharyngitis, despite being highly associated with TSS after subcutaneous infections. Finally, our studies indicate that enterotoxicity in SFP is not the result of superantigenicity.
TI  - [Erysipelas. A retrospective series of 92 patients in a department of internal medicine].
AB  - Erysipleas, also known as Saint Anthony's fire, is an acute infection of the skin caused, in most of cases, by group A streptococci. In the past, the most common site of involvement was the face and, in the pre-antibiotic era, mortality was high. In this retrospective study, we highlight the clinical and bacteriological features and report follow-up in 92 patients hospitalized in an internal medicine unit between 1st March 1992 and 31st December 1996 for 94 episodes of erysipelas. The involvement of the lower limbs predominated as involvement of the face is becoming very rare. Streptococci from others groups and Staphylococcus aureus have been implicated on occasions. Recovery is usual even if this infection may greatly weaken these often fragilized patients. In this paper, antibiotic treatment as well as the place of anticoagulants and Doppler ultrasound are discussed. Hospitalization is often necessary but it must not be systematic.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the ferric-uptake regulator, fur, from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Iron is an essential nutrient for the survival and pathogenesis of bacteria, but  relatively little is known regarding its transport and regulation in staphylococci. Based on the known sequences of ferric-uptake regulatory (fur) genes from several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, a fragment containing the fur homologue was cloned from a genomic library of Staphylococcus aureus RN450. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of a 447 bp ORF that encodes a putative 149 aa polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa. A putative ferrichrome-uptake (fhu) operon, containing the conserved Fur-binding sequences (Fur box) in the promoter region, was also cloned from the same S. aureus library. To characterize the impact of Fur on the fhu operon, fur was cloned, overexpressed as a His-tagged protein and purified by Ni2+-affinity column chromatography. The recombinant protein was digested with enterokinase to remove the His tag. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays indicated that Fur binds to the promoter region of the fhu operon in the presence of divalent cations. Fur also interacted with the promoter region of the recently reported sir operon that has been proposed to constitute a siderophore-transport system in S. aureus. The DNase I-protection assay revealed that Fur specifically binds to the Fur box located in the promoter region of the fhu operon. The primer-extension reaction indicated that the transcription-start site of the fhu operon was located inside the Fur box. S. aureus fur partially complemented a fur- mutation in Bacillus subtilis. The data suggest that Fur regulates iron-transport processes in S. aureus.
TI  - Superantigen antagonist protects against lethal shock and defines a new domain for T-cell activation.
AB  - Superantigens trigger an excessive cellular immune response, leading to toxic shock. We have designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits superantigen-induced expression of human genes for interleukin-2, gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor-b, which are cytokines that mediate shock. The peptide shows homology to a b-strand-hinge-a-helix domain that is structurally conserved in superantigens, yet is remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class II molecule and T-cell receptor. Superantigens depend on this domain for T-cell activation. The peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Surviving mice rapidly developed protective antibodies against superantigen that rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges, even with different superantigens. Thus, the lethal effect of superantigens can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the beginning of the toxicity cascade, before activation of T cells takes place.
TI  - Histopathological study of experimental poststreptococcal pneumonia in mice. Group A, type 50, streptococcal infection of murine nares controls with Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.
AB  - Microscopic methods (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry) have been used to assess previously unknown pulmonary inflammatory responses of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice secondary to infection via the nares by group A, type 50, streptococci suspended in saline ("strep group mice"). As controls for the strep group mice, the animals were either injected with saline alone via nares (no lesions were seen), or with Staphylococcus aureus in saline ("staph group mice") or with E. coli ("E. coli group mice"). The three different bacterial species caused clearly different histological changes in the lung. In the strep group mice, the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes, concomitant with vasoconstrictive angiopathy of encased pulmonary artery branches and nodular inflammatory cell aggregates in lung parenchyma. These aggregates either consisted predominantly of lymphocytes, or of mixed cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages) or of activated macrophages only. In 18 of 22 inflamed lungs of strep group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. In staph group mice the microscopic findings are consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes only. In 12 of 17 inflamed lungs of staph group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. In E. coli group mice the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of distal terminal bronchiolitis and early pleural-based pneumonitis, in which lymphocytes and neutrophils mingled with macrophages. In 10 of 11 inflamed lungs of E. coli group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. The morphologic approaches described here may have potential for unravelling the complex inflammatory processes underlying different forms of interstitial and parenchymal pneumonia.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) and by determining kill-times. The MICs of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. The MIC was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. Even lower MIC values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for Haemophilus influenzae and for Candida tropicalis. MIC and MBC values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the MFC for C. tropicalis and C. albicans was much higher. Only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a MIC value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus showed MIC at 62.5 micrograms/ml. The MIC and MBC values among the isolates were comparable, while the MFC value for the yeasts was greater. A concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for S. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae and S. mutans and for Moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  - Cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of and host defence against microbial infection.
AB  - Eukaryotic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are used by various cells and extracellular molecules in host defence against infection. They are involved in many processes including recognition by circulating phagocytes of a site of inflammation, transmigration through the endothelial barrier, diapedesis through basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and release of effector mechanisms at the infected site. CAMs involved in leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction include the selectins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. However, CAMs are also used by various microorganisms (protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses) during their pathogenesis. For example, bacteria that utilise CAMs include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia spp, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, Neisseria spp, Bordetella spp, and Borrelia burgdorferi. In addition, CAMs are involved in the pathogenetic effects of the RTX toxins of Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and the superantigen exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A recurrent and topical theme of potential importance within the bacterial group is the intimate relation between CAMs, bacterial protein receptors, and type III secretion systems. For example, the IpaBCD protein complex is secreted by the type III system of Shigella flexneri and interacts with alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on the eukaryotic cell surface, followed by Rho mediated internalisation; this illustrates the relevance of cellular microbiology. CAMs might prove to be novel therapeutic targets. Comparative genomics has provided the knowledge of shared virulence determinants among diverse bacterial genera, and will continue to deepen our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, particularly in the context of the interaction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecules.
TI  - Superantigens - powerful modifiers of the immune system.
AB  - Superantigens are powerful microbial toxins that activate the immune system by binding to class II major histocompatibility complex and T-cell receptor molecules. They cause a number of diseases characterized by fever and shock and are important virulence factors for two human commensal organisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as for some viruses. Their mode of action and variation around the common theme of over-stimulating T cells, provides a rich insight into the constant battle between microbes and the immune system.
TI  - The extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hylA) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Group A streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. The gene for this hyaluronidase (hylA) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 Da. Cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 Da. Comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. A region internal to the hylA gene was amplified from all 175 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.
TI  - An evaluation of antimicrobial efficiency of Endo-Fill root canal sealant and filling material.
AB  - The antimicrobial efficiency of Endo-Fill root canal sealant and filling material was microbiologically evaluated. The zones of inhibition around the Endo-Fill by agar diffusion method were measured. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Candiada albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as the selected microorganisms. No zone of inhibition was seen around the Endo-Fill in any of the examples.
TI  - Effects of the hinge region of cecropin A(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  - A 20-residue hybrid peptide (CA(1-8)-MA(1-12): KWKLFKKIGIGKFLHSAKKF-NH(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin A (CA) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (MA) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. In order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, Gly-Ile-Gly of CA(1-8)-MA(1-12) (CA-MA) on antibiotic activity, CA-MA and its three analogues, CA-MA1, CA-MA2 and CA-MA3 were synthesized. The Gly-Ile-Gly sequence of CA-MA was deleted in CA-MA1 and replaced with Pro and Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA2 and CA-MA3, respectively. CA-MA1 and CA-MA3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity against four different tumor cells, and the PC/PS (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities. However, CA-MA2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with CA-MA. These results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by Gly-Ile-Gly or Pro in the central part of CA-MA may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the N-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the C-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. CA-MA3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than CA-MA and CA-MA2. This result suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by Gly-Pro-Gly in CA-MA3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. It was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus species isolated from infectious skin diseases.
AB  - During the period from January of 1995 to June of 1998, 27 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 25 cases of infectious skin diseases including secondary infections, impetigo, phlegmone, and paronychia. The rate of beta-hemolytic streptococci among all kinds of the isolates was found to be similar during those 4 years, ranging from 3.5% to 5.6%. Staphylococcus aureus were found to coexist with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 20 (80%) out of 25 cases. beta-hemolytic streptococci were also often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-positive rods, or other species. Twelve cases (48%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. Most beta-hemolytic streptococci showed high susceptibilities to all antimicrobials tested; however S. agalactiae showed no susceptibility to gentamicin. The evaluation of characteristics of Streptococcus species is very important for selecting the right antimicrobial agents and the proper term of chemotherapy.
TI  - Efficacy of a new cream formulation of mupirocin: comparison with oral and topical agents in experimental skin infections.
AB  - A new cream formulation of mupirocin developed to improve patient compliance was  compared with systemic and topical antibiotics commonly used to treat primary and secondary skin infections. A mouse surgical wound model infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes was used. Topical treatment was applied at 4 and 10 h postinfection or oral treatment at a clinically relevant dose was administered 4, 8, and 12 h postinfection; treatments were continued three times daily for a further 3 days. Mupirocin cream was significantly more effective than (P < 0.01; two of eight studies) or not significantly different from (six of eight studies) mupirocin ointment in reducing bacterial numbers. Mupirocin cream was similar in efficacy to oral flucloxacillin but significantly more effective (P < 0.001) than oral erythromycin. It was also similar in efficacy to cephalexin against S. pyogenes but superior against S. aureus (P < 0.01). Mupirocin cream had a similar efficacy to fusidic acid cream against S. aureus but was significantly superior against S. pyogenes (P < 0.01). A hamster impetigo model infected with S. aureus was also used. Topical or oral treatment was administered at 24 and 30 h postinfection (also 36 h postinfection for oral therapy) and then three times daily for a further 2 days. On day 5, mupirocin cream was significantly more effective than mupirocin ointment in one study (P < 0.01) and of similar efficacy in the other two studies. Mupirocin cream was not significantly different from fusidic acid cream or neomycin-bacitracin cream, but it was significantly superior (P < 0.01) to oral erythromycin and cephalexin. Mupirocin cream was as effective as, or superior to, oral and other topical agents commonly used for skin infections.
TI  - [The clinical and economic efficacies of short courses of azithromycin in acute sinusitis].
AB  - A randomized study of a 3-day course of azithromycin therapy (500 mg once daily)  vs. a 10-day course of co-amoxiclav therapy (625 mg thrice daily) in patients with acute sinusitis was performed with an account of the GCP criteria. One hundred patients in 2 groups each of 50 persons were enrolled. The estimates of the patient body temperature, headache, pain on palpation in the area of the accessory nasal sinuses, nasal cavity stuffing, nasal discharge nature and the nose mucous membrane appearance were recorded prior to the treatment, in 72 hours and on the 10th-12th and 26th-30th days of the treatment. The microbiological analysis of the punctate from the accessory nasal sinuses was undertaken before the antibiotic therapy and 72 hours after its start. The economic analysis included the cost of the antibiotic therapy course, hospitalization term, medical manipulations and laboratory tests as well as the cost/efficacy index. The frequency of the relapses within 6 months after the cure was estimated in the two groups compared. In 72 hours and on the 10th-12th days after the treatment start the efficacy of azithromycin was significantly higher than that of co-amoxiclav. The cure was stated in 41 (82 per cent) and 26 (52 per cent) patients on the 10th-12th days, in 6 (12 per cent) and 21 (42 per cent) patients the improvement was stated and the fail was stated in 3 (6 per cent) and 2 (4 per cent) patients respectively. The efficacy of the drugs on the 26th-30th days after the treatment start did not differ. The isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were the main pathogens. The bacteriologic eradication was recorded in 29 (90.6 per cent) patients treated with azithromycin and only in 18 (69.2 per cent) patients treated with co-amoxiclav. Adverse reactions and relapses of the disease within 6 months after the cure were more frequent in the patients treated with co-amoxiclav. The cost of the azithromycin therapy was significantly lower. It was shown that the shortened course of the azithromycin therapy provided earlier cure of the patients with acute sinusitis, better tolerance of the drug, less frequent adverse reactions, lower cost as compared to the use of co-amoxiclav and no relapses.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Post-varicella epiglottitis and necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Varicella is a nearly ubiquitous acquired childhood disease. Infectious complications of varicella can be life- or limb-threatening. These complications appear 3 to 4 days after the appearance of varicella exanthem and are heralded by fever, pain, and erythema of the overlying skin. Airway complications of varicella are rare, rapidly evolving, and, unfortunately, difficult to visualize. We report a child who presented with a unique combination of varicella-induced airway complications-acute epiglottitis and subsequent necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck. varicella, epiglottitis, necrotizing fasciitis, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, nasopharyngoscopy.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effects of Propolis Extracts on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Strains Resistant to Various Antibiotics and Some Microorganisms.
AB  - ABSTRACT Propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. The bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant in the hive. Propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties. In this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three Escherichia coli and two Staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on Salmonella typhimurium, Bruceila abortus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger were studied. Propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). At concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the microorganisms in acetone and DMSO in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. The results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.
TI  - Multilocus sequence typing.
AB  - Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) provides a new approach to molecular epidemiology that can identify and track the global spread of virulent or antibiotic-resistant isolates of bacterial pathogens using the Internet. MLST databases, together with interrogation software, are available for Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae and databases for Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus will be released shortly.
TI  - Exploration of the in-vitro pharmacodynamic activity of moxifloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci of lancefield groups A and G.
AB  - The serum concentrations associated with the oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin every 24 h over 48 h in man were simulated in an in-vitro dilutional, continuous bacterial culture model of infection. The initial inoculum was 5 x 10(7)-5 x 10(8) cfu/mL and all strains were tested on at least three occasions. Two strains of Staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin susceptible, the other resistant) with moxifloxacin MICs 0.14 mg/L and 0.06 mg/L and two strains of beta-haemolytic streptococci, Lancefield Group A, MIC 0. 16 mg/L and Group G, MIC 0.4 mg/L were used. In addition, two laboratory-generated mutants with raised moxifloxacin MICs were also employed: methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) MIC 1.0 mg/L and Group A streptococcus MIC 1.8 mg/L. The antibacterial effect of moxifloxacin was judged by changes in viable count over time, and the area under the bacterial-kill curve (AUBKC) after 24 and 48 h. For S. aureus MIC 0.14 mg/L the AUBKC(24) (log cfu/mL.h) was 77.8 +/- 4.6 and AUBKC(48) 92.0 +/- 6.9. For its mutant, moxifloxacin MIC 1.0 mg/L, the AUBKC(24) was 116.1 +/- 15.6 and AUBKC(48) 211.9 +/- 23.1, indicating decreased killing. AUBKC(24) and AUBKC(48) values of 110.7 +/- 10.3 and 130.9 +/- 21.3, respectively, were noted for the MRSA strain. The Group A streptococcus, MIC 0.16 mg/L, had an AUBKC(24) of 91.4 +/- 19.4 and AUBKC(48) of 157.0 +/- 70.9. The mutant, MIC 1.8 mg/L, had an AUBKC(24) of 127.0 +/- 1.9 and AUBKC(48) of 205.1 +/- 6.4. Despite a lower MIC (0.4 mg/L) the single strain of Group G streptococcus tested was killed poorly, AUBKC(24) 139.9 +/- 3.6 and AUBKC(48) 252.3 +/- 18.6. The pharmacodynamic parameters AUC/MIC, T > MIC, (AUC > MIC)/MIC (AUC = area under the curve, T = time) and WAUC ((AUC/MIC) (T > MIC/100)) (WAUC = weighted area under the curve) were related to AUBKC(24) and AUBKC(48) using an inhibitory sigmoid E(max) model. T > MIC was poorly related to AUBKC (r = 0.36) while AUC/MIC, (AUC > MIC)/MIC and WAUC were strongly related to AUBKC(24) (r = 0.75-0.79) and AUBKC(48) (r = 0.78-0.84). The maximum antibacterial effect was achieved with an AUC/MIC ratio of 150-200. AUC-related pharmacodynamic parameters predicted antibacterial effect better than T > MIC.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - Lipoteichoic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced adhesion molecule expression and IL-8 release in human lung microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  - Cell adhesion molecule expression (CAM) and IL-8 release in lung microvascular endothelium facilitate neutrophil accumulation in the lung. This study investigated the effects of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, alone and with LPS or TNF-alpha, on CAM expression and IL-8 release in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). The concentration-dependent effects of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) LTA (0.3-30 microg/ml) on ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression and IL-8 release were bell shaped. Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) LTA had no effect on CAM expression, but caused a concentration-dependent increase in IL-8 release. S. aureus and S. pyogenes LTA (30 microg/ml) abolished LPS-induced CAM expression, and S. aureus LTA reduced LPS-induced IL-8 release. In contrast, the effects of S. aureus LTA with TNF-alpha on CAM expression and IL-8 release were additive. Inhibitory effects of LTA were not due to decreased HLMVEC viability, as assessed by ethidium homodimer-1 uptake. Changes in neutrophil adhesion to HLMVEC paralleled changes in CAM expression. Using RT-PCR to assess mRNA levels, S. aureus LTA (3 microg/ml) caused a protein synthesis-dependent reduction (75%) in LPS-induced IL-8 mRNA and decreased the IL-8 mRNA half-life from >6 h with LPS to approximately 2 h. These results suggest that mechanisms exist to prevent excessive endothelial cell activation in the presence of high concentrations of bacterial products. However, inhibition of HLMVEC CAM expression and IL-8 release ultimately may contribute to decreased neutrophil accumulation, persistence of bacteria in the lung, and increased severity of infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  - Macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as Legionella, Chlamydia, Campylobacter spp, Branhamella spp, Pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. Emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are found in France and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. RU 004, HMR 3647, and TE 802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. Research at Abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-O-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. Research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. Another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. Bacterial resistance ( such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. Many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. The new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. This presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young Filipino infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. As part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of Filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. METHOD: During a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 Manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. Chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). After exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in 35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. The organisms responsible for meningitis were Acinetobacter spp. (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter spp. (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were Salmonella spp. (6), Enterobacter spp. (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), other Gram-negative organisms (8), S. pneumoniae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). In 685 infants examined for viral causes of their illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). Enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). Concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. CONCLUSION: Many young Filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. Thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with Salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by Gram-negative organisms. Pneumococcus was an unusual cause.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of severe infection in children less than three months old in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the bacterial and viral etiology of severe infection in young Papua New Guinean infants as part of a multicenter study in four developing countries aimed at improving case management guidelines. METHODS: Between March, 1991, and April, 1993, children aged <3 months were recruited at the outpatient department of Goroka Base Hospital, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Children with pre-defined inclusion criteria were enrolled, a history was taken and clinical examination was performed. Blood and urine were collected from children with signs suggestive of severe disease together with eye, umbilical and pernasal swabs as appropriate. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with and without signs of severe disease for identification of viruses and Chlamydia trachomatis by direct fluorescent antibody staining. RESULTS: 3280 infants were triaged and 2168 enrolled, among whom 968 had signs suggestive of severe disease. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Staphylococcus aureus were the most important bacterial pathogens isolated from children < 1 month old with severe infections, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were most important in older children. Of 292 eye swabs 19 (7%) grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Of 116 umbilical swabs 51 (44%) grew S. pyogenes and 45 (39%) grew Staphylococcus aureus. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most important viral cause of acute lower respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are important causes of severe infection in young children in the PNG highlands. It is necessary to improve access to clean water, promote hand-washing in the hospital and at home and investigate further the use of maternal immunization for the prevention of severe disease in young infants.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Fusidic acid in skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - Skin and soft skin tissue infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus pyogenes. In vitro data show good activity of fusidic acid against staphylococci but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for streptococci are relatively high indicating marginal activity. A limited number of clinical trials have been performed using oral fusidic acid and although all have methodological problems the difference in susceptibility of these two organisms is apparent. The end of study cure rates for these studies were 91-99% for S. aureus and 75-85% for S. pyogenes. Topical therapy has been used in a number of forms and for different skin infections. Comparative studies have been conducted with mupirocin, trimethoprim/polymixin cream, hydrogen peroxide and combination steroid preparations. For most of these studies fusidic acid was equivalent to the comparator agent except where there was a proven S. pyogenes infection. Studies with topical fusidic acid have also been reported in specific disease states such as acne, erythrasma, and abscesses with good results.
TI  - Characteristics in adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from various infective skin lesions: serum IgA decreases adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes but not Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We characterized adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various infective skin lesions in terms of hydrophobicity, negative charge, tube adherence, slime production, and influence on adherence to coverslips by plasma and serum immunoglobulins. High hydrophobicity was more frequently observed in Streptococcus pyogenes strains than in Streptococcus agalactiae strains (P < 0.01) and S. aureus strains (P < 0.001) and slime production was more frequently observed in S. agalactiae strains than in S. pyogenes strains (P < 0.05). Serum IgA decreased adherence to coverslips of S. pyogenes strains but not that of S. aureus strains.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Optimal treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) are the main cause of skin and skin structure infections (SSSI). Treatment presents a clinical challenge to the physician, particularly with the increase in multidrug-resistant strains and widespread cross-resistance to antibiotic treatment. Initial treatment of SSSI involves the use of fluoroquinolones or penicillinase-resistant penicillins. If infection is caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci, therapy with glycopeptides is warranted. However, in the last few years several cases of infection caused by strains of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides have been reported. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin that has shown efficacy in the management of multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections. Two major studies suggest that in the treatment of complicated SSSI, the clinical efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin is equivalent to that of vancomycin and/or oxacillin and vancomycin and/or cefazolin.
TI  - Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein inhibits growth of a strain of Acholeplasma laidlawii and L forms of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) inhibited growth of cell wall-deficient Acholeplasma laidlawii and L forms of certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. However, the same strains of S. aureus and S. pyogenes with intact cell walls were not susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects of BPI.
TI  - Correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  - The correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. Besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. Despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. Some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase Negative Staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. Two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in Icelandic children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in Finland.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of the CAMP factor gene (cfa) of group A  streptococci.
AB  - The CAMP reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (CAMP factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C (beta-toxin). Group A streptococci (GAS [Streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered CAMP negative, and this reaction commonly has been used to distinguish GAS from Streptococcus agalactiae. We here provide evidence that GAS possess this gene and produce an extracellular CAMP factor capable of participating in a positive CAMP reaction. The S. pyogenes CAMP factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the CAMP factor genes from S. agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. This gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant clones of E. coli expressing cfa secreted an active CAMP factor. The deduced 28.5-kDa protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. The cfa gene is widely spread among GAS: 82 of 100 clinical GAS isolates produced a positive CAMP reaction. Of the CAMP-negative strains, 17 of the 18 GAS strains contained the cfa gene. Additionally, CAMP activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups C, M, P, R, and U. The cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in Escherichia coli and gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under control of the cfa promoter. These cfa promoter-lacZ fusions were introduced into S. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. The results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the CAMP factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups A, B, C, G, M, P, R, and U.
TI  - Cytokine and chemokine induction using cell wall component and toxin derived from gram-positive bacteria in the rat middle ear.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is one of the components present within the cell wall layer of most gram-positive bacteria. It plays an important role in the initiation and progression of bacterial infection. In this study, we performed a rat middle ear and nasal perfusion with LTA purified from two different gram-positive bacterial species. Using ELISA and RT-PCR, the production and mRNA expression of rat chemokine, GRO/CINC-1, proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, in rat middle ear lavage and mucosa were investigated. GRO/CINC-1 in middle ear lavage was produced by stimulation of LTA in a time-dependent fashion; however, TNF-alpha production into the lavage was not detectable using ELISA assay. The mRNA expressions of GRO/CINC-1 and TNF-alpha in the middle ear mucosa were both induced after LTA and exotoxin exposures. The expression of IL-10 mRNA was also induced after 6 h of LTA and exotoxin exposures. The profile of the production of GRO/CINC-1 and TNF-alpha in rat nasal lavage was similar to that in the middle ear; however, the mRNA expressions of GRO/CINC-1, TNF-alpha and IL-10 in the nasal mucosa were different from those in the middle ear mucosa. These results suggest that the cell wall component and exotoxin of gram-positive bacteria can induce several cytokines in vivo and play an important role in the initiation of the inflammatory cascade in the middle ear.
TI  - Animal models used to test the interactions between infectious agents and products of cigarette smoked implicated in sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Animal test systems are reviewed that have relevance to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are reviewed. These test interactions between infectious agents (or their toxins) and products of cigarette smoke. Infectious agents implicated in SIDS include members of the enterobacteria and clostridia, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Smoking is thought to be the single most preventable cause of SIDS. Tobacco smoke contains many extremely toxic products including cyanide and nicotine. Many animal test systems are available to examine the potency of bacterial toxins and smoke-derived components. These include mice, hamsters, rats and chick embryos. Such systems reveal synergy between bacterial toxins, especially endotoxin and superantigens. They have also demonstrated potentiation of low levels of bacterial toxin by low levels of both nicotine and its primary metabolite, cotinine. These findings suggest a possible causal explanation for the fact that passive exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor in sudden infant death syndrome.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobials used for therapy of otitis media and sinusitis: effect of previous antimicrobial therapy and smoking.
AB  - We undertook to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens isolated from patients with otitis media or maxillary sinusitis who failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy, and correlate it with previous antimicrobial therapy and smoking. We analyzed isolates recovered from 2 consecutive cultures obtained from middle ear aspirate obtained through an open perforation in 22 children with otitis, and maxillary sinus aspirate collected by endoscopy from 20 patients. Forty-seven isolates were repeatedly recovered from 42 culture-positive individuals. The organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (14), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), and Streptococcus pyogenes (5). Resistance of at least 2 tube dilutions to the antimicrobial agents used was found in 23 of the 47 (49%) isolates that were found in 20 (48%) of the patients. These included 10 of 15 (67%) isolates of S pneumoniae, 4 of 14 (29%) H influenzae (all were beta-lactamase producers), 4 of 7 (57%) S aureus (all beta-lactamase producers), 5 of 6 (83%) M catarrhalis (all beta-lactamase producers), and none of 5 S pyogenes. In the 21 patients who failed to respond to amoxicillin, H influenzae and S pneumoniae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 4 of the 11 (36%) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 4 of 21 (19%) after amoxicillin, 2 of 3 (67%) after azithromycin dihydrate, and 1 of 4 (25%) after cefixime. A statistically significant higher recovery of resistant organisms was noted in those treated 2 to 6 months previously, and in those with sinusitis who smoked. The data illustrate the relationship between resistance to antimicrobials and failure of patients with otitis media and sinusitis to improve.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin with those of other agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of and pathogen responses to sparfloxacin were compared with those of standard therapies for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin or skin-structure infections, urinary tract infections, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute maxillary sinusitis in 7 multicenter controlled trials in North America. Sparfloxacin was administered orally as a 400-mg loading dose followed by 200 mg once daily for up to 10 days. The bacteriologic efficacy of sparfloxacin (84% to 95%) was comparable to that of comparator drugs (77% to 100%). Sparfloxacin was generally 2 to 8 times more active (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains tested [MIC90]: 0.03 to 0.5 microg/mL) than comparators against common pathogens isolated in community-acquired infections, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains; Moraxella catarrhalis; Haemophilus influenzae; Streptococcus pyogenes; and Staphylococcus aureus. Sparfloxacin was also effective against Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species. The emergence of resistance was uncommon during sparfloxacin therapy (0.3% of 1100 cases). Higher area under the plasma concentration-time curve/MIC and maximum plasma concentration/MIC ratios for sparfloxacin were associated with clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, whereas lower ratios were associated with clinical and bacteriologic failure. The clinical efficacy of sparfloxacin (80% to 95%) was comparable to that obtained with the comparator drugs (71% to 92%). In addition, sparfloxacin was well tolerated and had an overall frequency of related adverse events similar to that of the comparators. There was a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions but a lower level of digestive adverse events with sparfloxacin compared with comparators. Sparfloxacin is a suitable therapeutic alternative for the empiric treatment of respiratory tract infections owing to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile and activity against typical and atypical respiratory tract pathogens, even in geographic areas with a high incidence of penicillin resistance.
TI  - Feglymycin, a novel inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus. Fermentation, isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  - The novel peptide feglymycin has been isolated from cultures of Streptomyces sp.  DSM 11171 by solid phase extraction, size exclusion chromatography and repeated reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular weight was found to be 1900.90 g/mol and the molecular formula is C95H97Nl3O30. Feglymycin contains 13 amino acids of which four are 3-hydroxyphenylglycine and five are 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues. The structure of the linear peptide has been determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The sequence was confirmed by the observed mass spectroscopic fragmentation pattern. As well as having weak antibacterial activity, feglymycin inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of moxifloxacin and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  - The time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of moxifloxacin were studied for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moxifloxacin had a bactericidal effect against all strains tested, with the least rapid bactericidal effect being against S. pyogenes and the most rapid effect against S. aureus and E. coli. The PAE of moxifloxacin was similar to that of other fluoroquinolones and increased with increasing concentration. No association was found between the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin and the duration of PAE. Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also exposed to concentrations of moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin that simulated the drug concentrations obtained in human serum after standard oral dosing schedules. Simulation of moxifloxacin concentrations in human serum reduced viable counts more effectively and more rapidly than shown in time-kill experiments; in contrast, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin were less effective than when constant concentrations of these antibacterials were used.
TI  - Increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  - In vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of IL-1alpha and IL-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in any supernatants from 21 donors tested. In 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from Streptococcus, (S.) sanguis, S. salivarius and S. mitis induced production of IL-6. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. However, no significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen in 13 donors without PPP. No significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the PPP and non-PPP subjects, when stimulated with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and pokeweed mitogen. In the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in purified T-cells. but not in B-cells. These data suggest that IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which T-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Str. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were included in the study. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated aerobically. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition. Saline was always ineffective. Decreased concentration of NaOCl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. Cresophene showed a significantly larger (P < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. Alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: 5.25% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. A reduced concentration of NaOCl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. When compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.
TI  - In vitro activities of macrolides against gram-positive aerobes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: New macrolides with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics have been developed and introduced for clinical use in Taiwan. In order to understand the antibacterial activities of these new macrolides, we tested their in vitro activities against common pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin for clinical isolates collected from six teaching hospitals in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: High MICs were detected against most of the bacteria tested except for H influenzae and M catarrhalis. The MIC90 for viridans streptococci, S pneumoniae, S pyogenes, Enterococcus spp, S aureus (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant), Coryne-bacterium spp, and B fragilis were all at least 128 micrograms/ml. Wide ranges of MICs were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria tested were highly resistant to macrolides. This result is a warning for clinicians that rational use of antibiotics, including macrolides, is mandatory.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - The effect of previous antibiotic therapy on the bacteriology of the tonsils in children.
AB  - The bacteriology of the tonsillar surface and core in 30 children undergoing tonsillectomy was studied. Antibiotics taken in the six months before surgery were recorded. Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus were the commonest isolates; Streptococcus pyogenes was relatively rare. Eight children had received no antibiotics, the others had been prescribed 65 different courses of 13 different types. No relationship between the various antibiotic regimens prescribed and tonsillar bacteriology could be demonstrated, and it would appear that the tonsillar bacteriology at the time of tonsillectomy is not altered by antibiotics prescribed in the previous six months.
TI  - Structure and function of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens in septic shock.
AB  - The pyrogenic exotoxins of Group A Streptococci and enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus constitute a family of related toxins that acts as "superantigens" because of their ability to stimulate large numbers of T-cell subsets. These toxins have been implicated in gastrointestinal food poisoning, toxic shock syndromes, Gram-positive sepsis, and, possibly, septic shock. There is increasing evidence that Gram-positive infections frequently coexist in septic shock and that bacterial superantigens play a major role.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect and postantibiotic sub-mic effect of dirithromycin and erythromycin against respiratory tract pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of dirithromycin and erythromycin against strains Streptococcus pyogenes group A M12, NCTC P1800, Streptococcus pneumoniae 23, Staphylococcus aureus Oxford strain 209, Moraxella catarrhalis 15616 and Haemophilus influenzae 5590 was investigated in vitro and in vivo by use of the tissue cage model in rabbits. By exposing strains to 2.5-5 x MIC levels for 6 h or 12 h, both compounds induced in vitro PAEs of 1-9 h, and in two cases >20 h. Cultures in the PAE-phase were then re-exposed to subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x MIC and 0.5 x MIC) of antibiotic and prolonged suppression of regrowth was obtained for 2->20 h. Following i.v. antibiotic treatment of rabbits (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg dirithromycin and 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg erythromycin) and bacterial infection of the implanted tissue cages in the same rabbit, the tissue cage fluid (TCF) was sampled 6 h after infection and regrowth was monitored by sampling from new tissue cages in untreated rabbits. These i.v. single doses of both antibiotics induced in vivo PAEs of >6 h, but <20 h against S. pyogenes. Suppression of regrowth in TCF was also obtained for > or = 20 h on infection with exposed S. pyogenes in the PAE-phase in newly implanted tissue cages in rabbits that had been treated with low doses of antibiotic to produce subinhibitory concentrations in the TCE Dirithromycin was in general as active as erythromycin in inducing PAE and in prolonging suppression of bacterial regrowth in the PAE phase.
TI  - Incidence of post operative wound infection and their antibiogram in a teaching and referral hospital.
AB  - A total of 406 post-operative clean wounds were studied for the presence of sepsis and antibiogram of organisms were established. The over all post-operative sepsis rate was 13% (clinical) and 12% (bacteriological). Staphylococcus aureus (32%) and Pseudomonas species (21%) were the commonest organisms recovered and Netilmycin, Cephaloridine and Norfloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against both Gram positive and negative infections. This study reflects the change in pattern of infecting bacterial flora in case of post operative wound infections and its antibiogram.
TI  - New N-substituted 7-aminocephalosporanic acid derivatives as potential agents against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Synthesis and in vitro activity.
AB  - The synthesis and the antimicrobial properties of a new series of cephalosporinic beta-lactam antibiotics is described. The data reported in the present paper show the potential of this type of substituted cephalosporins as new anti Gram-positive antibiotic drugs. In fact, all compounds tested showed a good in vitro antibacterial activity against the most relevant Gram-positive pathogens including resistant species that currently represent unmet medical need. On the contrary, the new synthesized compounds were found to be completely devoid of any activity on Gram-negative bacteria up to a concentration of the single agent of 128 microg/ml.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of G1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  - G1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in Cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. A compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. We tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. The following are MIC50, MIC90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: E. coli 16, 16, 4 32; Klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; Citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; Enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; Enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; Staphylococcus aureus 8, 16, 4-16; Streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; Streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; Candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; Candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; Candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. MIC values appear lower for Gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. G1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of E. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC50 and MIC90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for both MRSA and MSSA; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for MRSE; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for MSSE; 0.125 microgram/mL and 0.125 microgram/mL for S. pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for S. pneumoniae. Eighty-two percent of the tested E. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an MIC50 of 2 micrograms/mL and an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/mL. Quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common Gram-positive bacteria other than E. faecalis in Taiwan.
TI  - Bacteria associated with clinical mastitis in dairy heifers.
AB  - A 1-yr field investigation of clinical mastitis in heifers was carried out in 24  veterinary districts in Norway. Quarter lacteal secretions from cases that occurred prepartum or within 14 d postpartum were examined bacteriologically. The study included 1040 heifers with clinical mastitis, and the total number of quarters that were clinically affected was 1361. The organisms that were most frequently isolated from samples from these quarters were Staphylococcus aureus (44.3%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (18.2%), Staph. aureus together with Strep. dysgalactiae (1.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3.5%), A. pyogenes together with Strep. dysgalactiae (0.5%) or Staph. aureus (0.4%), and Escherichia coli (6.4%). Of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus simulans (53.7%), Staphylococcus hyicus (14.8%), and Staphylococcus chromogenes (14.8%) were the most prevalent species. Except for a higher relative percentage of A. pyogenes in cases that occurred before parturition (8.2%) than in cases that occurred after parturition (2.7%), no significant differences were observed in the distribution of the various organisms among prepartum and postpartum cases. Regional variations were observed in the distribution of organisms. The proportions of Staph. aureus and A. pyogenes were highest, and the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci was lowest, in late autumn and early winter. The proportion of E. coli was highest in summer. In heifers in which mastitis was associated with increased rectal temperature or other systemic signs, the proportion of clinically affected quarters that were infected with Staph. aureus was larger than that in heifers without systemic reaction.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of acetic acid and Burow's solution as topical otological preparations.
AB  - At present there are no topical otological preparations on the World Health Organisation's essential drug list, largely due to the ototoxic potential of preparations containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. Acetic acid and Burow's solution have long been used in the treatment of the discharging ear. The aim of this study was to ascertain the antibacterial activity of these two preparations against the most commonly occurring bacteria isolated from discharging ears in our department. Twenty fresh isolates of each of the following organisms--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pyogenes--were plated onto blood agar and tested against one per cent, two per cent and three per cent acetic acid and Burow's solution (13 per cent aluminium acetate). The activity of each agent was ascertained by the size of the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. Burow's solution showed significantly larger average zones of inhibition than acetic acid (p < 0.001). The two per cent and three per cent acetic acid as well as the Burow's solution were active against all the organisms tested.

TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria and mechanisms of their targeting to the cell wall envelope.
AB  - The cell wall envelope of gram-positive bacteria is a macromolecular, exoskeletal organelle that is assembled and turned over at designated sites. The cell wall also functions as a surface organelle that allows gram-positive pathogens to interact with their environment, in particular the tissues of the infected host. All of these functions require that surface proteins and enzymes be properly targeted to the cell wall envelope. Two basic mechanisms, cell wall sorting and targeting, have been identified. Cell well sorting is the covalent attachment of surface proteins to the peptidoglycan via a C-terminal sorting signal that contains a consensus LPXTG sequence. More than 100 proteins that possess cell wall-sorting signals, including the M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A of Staphylococcus aureus, and several internalins of Listeria monocytogenes, have been identified. Cell wall targeting involves the noncovalent attachment of proteins to the cell surface via specialized binding domains. Several of these wall-binding domains appear to interact with secondary wall polymers that are associated with the peptidoglycan, for example teichoic acids and polysaccharides. Proteins that are targeted to the cell surface include muralytic enzymes such as autolysins, lysostaphin, and phage lytic enzymes. Other examples for targeted proteins are the surface S-layer proteins of bacilli and clostridia, as well as virulence factors required for the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes (internalin B) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PspA) infections. In this review we describe the mechanisms for both sorting and targeting of proteins to the envelope of gram-positive bacteria and review the functions of known surface proteins.
TI  - Obturator internus muscle abscess in children: report of seven cases and review.
AB  - Obturator internus muscle (OIM) abscess is an uncommon entity often mistaken for  septic arthritis of the hip. We describe seven children with OIM abscess and review seven previously reported cases. The most common presenting symptoms were hip or thigh pain (14 patients), fever (13), and limp (13). The hip was flexed, abducted, and externally rotated in 11 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) were diagnostic for OIM abscess in the 14 patients. Associated abscesses were located in the obturator externus muscle (5 patients), psoas muscle (2), and iliac muscle (1). The etiologic agents were Staphylococcus aureus (8 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), and Enterococcus faecalis (1). Three patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage, and three had surgical drainage. Three patients had ischial osteomyelitis in addition to OIM abscess. The 11 children with uncomplicated OIM abscess were treated for a median of 28 days. All patients had an uneventful recovery.
TI  - Life-threatening rashes: dermatologic signs of four infectious diseases.
AB  - Four infectious diseases that are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality are Rocky Mountain spotted fever, meningococcal disease, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These diseases necessitate a timely diagnosis and treatment, which may be facilitated by recognition of the characteristic cutaneous findings. Herein the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management are presented, with emphasis on the dermatologic signs of each disease. A dermatology consultation can be valuable, but all physicians should be familiar with the cutaneous findings of these potentially life-threatening diseases.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Secondarily infected wounds and dermatoses: a diagnosis and treatment guide.
AB  - Secondary bacterial skin infections are common complications of primary dermatoses, primary nonbacterial skin infections, traumatic lesions, ulcers, cutaneous infestations, and other miscellaneous skin diseases. Most diagnoses are based on information obtained by patient history and physical examination. Secondary bacterial skin infections may be polymicrobial, commonly include the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and require proper antibiotic treatment. The use of topical antibiotics avoids the risk of systemic allergic reactions or generalized side effects, and provides a high antibiotic concentration at the site of infection. Therefore, topical antibiotics should be considered as potential primary therapy in the emergency department. When systemic therapy is indicated, most commonly used agents for secondary skin infections are the penicillinase-resistant semi-synthetic penicillins; the first-generation cephalosporins, the macrolides; and combination antibacterials, such as amoxicillin/ clavulanate potassium and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of axillary hidradenitis suppurativa.
AB  - A retrospective review of the microbiological and clinical data of 17 specimens obtained from axillary hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) over a period of 6 years was undertaken to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of this condition. A total of 42 bacterial isolates (2.5 per specimen) were obtained, 12 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 30 anaerobic or micro-aerophilic (1.8 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were isolated in six (35%) cases, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in four (24%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (six isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (three) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two). The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (10), Prevotella spp. (seven), micro-aerophilic streptococci (four), Fusobacterium spp. (three) and Bacteroides spp. sensu stricto (three). This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in axillary HS and the need for antimicrobial thereby to reflect this.
TI  - Streptococci isolated from various skin lesions: the interaction with Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - We isolated 73 streptococcus strains (41 from infections, and 32 from colonization) from various skin diseases between March, 1994, and June, 1998. In 29 out of 41 cases of infective origin, Staphylococcus aureus strains were simultaneously isolated. Twenty-four out of 28 patients with impetigo were suffering from atopic dermatitis. We confirmed that impetigo lesions where Streptococcus pyogenes was dominant in number always showed thick-walled pustules on an erythematous base; these skin lesions were considered to be an early manifestation of streptococcal impetigo. We further confirmed that thick-crusted lesions in streptococcal impetigo, where S. aureus exceeded S. pyogenes in number, were a late manifestation. Antimicrobial agents such as minocycline, fusidic acid, ofloxacin and tosufloxacin, were more effective against S. aureus strains than against beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains. In contrast, ampicillin, cefdinir, imipenem, erythromycin and vancomycin were more effective against beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Streptococcal pyomyositis: case report and review.
AB  - Pyomyositis is most often associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections after  trauma. We describe an unusual presentation of pyomyositis of the chest wall secondary to group A betahemolytic streptococcus infection in a 15-month-old child with acute abdominal symptoms. In addition, the patient had no history or evidence of trauma to the affected area. Pyomyositis presenting in this manner secondary to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection in the absence of a primary varicella infection has not been previously reported.
TI  - Multiple specificities of the staphylococcal and streptococcal fibronectin-binding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules.
AB  - Many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria express fibronectin (Fn)-binding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs), most of which have a similar structural organization with a primary ligand-binding domain consisting of 3-6 repeats of 40-50 amino-acid-residue motifs. The MSCRAMMs appear to preferentially bind to the N-terminal region of Fn, which is composed of five type-I modules. Here we report that the Fn-binding MSCRAMM FnbpA of Staphylococcus aureus contains a second ligand-binding domain located outside the repeat units. In addition, several sites in the Fn N-terminus presented as recombinant type-I module pairs bind to the repeat domain of the MSCRAMM. All of the MSCRAMMs analyzed, which include FnbpA of Staphylococcus aureus, Sfb of Streptococcus pyogenes, and FnbA and FnbB of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were shown to bind to multiple sites in the N-terminal domain of Fn. By dissecting the repeat domain of FnbpA using synthetic peptides and recombinant fragments, we show that discrete, different motifs are responsible for the binding to individual sites in Fn, rather than a common motif being able to bind to several pairs of type-I Fn modules. The C-terminal half of many of the MSCRAMM repeat units contain a common motif, which is shown here to bind to the type-I module pair 4 and 5. In addition, some of the repeat units of FnbpA contain N-terminal motifs which bound to the type-I module pairs 1-2 and 2-3, respectively. These latter binding motifs appear to be partly overlapping and dependent on flanking sequences. Fluorescence polarization experiments using fluorescein-labeled MSCRAMM peptides and recombinant type-I Fn module pairs revealed dissociation constants of 1-13 microM. It was also shown that the fluorescein-labeled peptides differed in their primary binding sites on Fn.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of persistent otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogens isolated from children with acute otitis media who did not respond to antimicrobial drug therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cultures obtained by tympanocentesis from 46 children. RESULTS: Organisms were recovered from 34 children (74%), and 43 isolates were recovered from these individuals. The organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (12 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (5 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (5 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (2 isolates). Resistance to the antimicrobial agent used was found in 27 (63%) of 43 isolates found in 22 patients (48%). Of patients who did not respond to amoxicillin therapy, H influenzae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 5 (56%) of 9 of those who did not respond to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy, 4 (44%) of 9 patients after azithromycin therapy, 3 (25%) of 12 patients after amoxicillin therapy, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy and from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the relation between resistance to antimicrobial drug therapy and failure of patients with otitis media to improve. They also highlight the importance of diagnostic tympanocentesis in establishing the presence of resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in pharyngitis and tonsillitis].
AB  - The aim of the study was a microbiological analysis of pharyngeal swabs obtained  from 158 patients with the diagnosis of pharyngitis and purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. Beta haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G were isolated from 30% of the patients. The most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pyogenes--12% of patients and Streptococcus group C--10.7%. Other streptococci were isolated less frequently: Streptococcus group B--44%, group G--2.5%. The majority of isolated bacteria belonged to potential pathogenic flora (70% patients). Staphylococcus aureus (37%) and Haemophilus spp. (36%) were isolated most frequently. Other bacteria were isolated in the following sequence: Moraxella catarrhalis--22%, Streptococcus pneumoniae--17% and Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family--6%. One case of Plaut-Vincent tonsillitis was diagnosed. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. The isolated anaerobic bacteria belonged to genus of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.
TI  - Unconventional organization of the division and cell wall gene cluster of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The genes responsible for cell wall biosynthesis and cell division (dcw genes) were identified and sequenced in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The genetic organization of the dcw cluster in Streptococcus pneumoniae differed significantly from the clusters of other bacteria reported to date. In particular, the genes corresponding to the 2 min region of the Escherichia coli chromosome were found distributed in three genetically separate regions of the Streptococcus pneumoniae chromosome. The first region contained the expected ftsA and ftsZ cell division genes at one end and pbp2b, ddl and murF at the other end. The murD, murG and divIB genes, always found located upstream of ftsA, were found in a second region separated from the first. A third region contained the yllC, yllD, pbp2x and mraY genes. The chromosomal region downstream of ftsZ was also sequenced and characterized. In Streptococcus pneumoniae this region contains four ORFs, all of unknown function, and an ORF encoding the Bacillus subtilis DivIVA homologue. The gene order and the organization of this region was found to be conserved in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis, raising the possibility that previously unidentified loci may also be involved in division.
TI  - [The role of superantigens in infectious diseases].
AB  - Exogenous antigens are presented to T lymphocytes through mechanisms that ensure  high recognition specificity. Recently described superantigens in contrast to conventional antigens are particles that follow a different processing and presentation route not binding to a specific region of T lymphocyte receptors. These particles bind to a large number of T lymphocytes, generating a disproportionate and non-specific immune response. Two types of superantigens have been described. Endogenous superantigens, transported in the host genoma, have been involved in clonal depletion and immunological tolerance phenomena. Exogenous superantigens, mainly bacterial toxins, have been involved in several diseases. There is evidence that these antigens participate in diseases such as Kawasaki disease, toxic shock caused by Staphylococcus aureus, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV infection and Streptococcus pyogenes infections.

TI  - The risk of infective thyroiditis in nodular goitres.
AB  - Infective thyroiditis which was more common in the pre-antibiotic era is now rare in developed countries but continues to occur in less developed areas. Over a 10-year period in Zaria, Nigeria which is situated in an endemic goitre region, nine such patients were treated. All were females, 30-50 years of age and had pre-existing, long-standing multinodular goitres. During the period, 84 patients (including the nine patients) with endemic multinodular goitres were treated, giving an infective rate of 10.7% in these goitres. Treatment was by adequate incision and drainage in all patients with suppuration. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism cultured and Streptococcus Pyogenes and Pseudomonas were the infective agents in a minority. Only one patient required thyroidectomy later, the goitre having disappeared in the other patients. One patient developed hypothyroidism requiring replacement therapy with thyroxine. Thyroid abscess remains an ever present risk in endemic multinodular goitres in our environment. Early presentation after onset of pain, prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics and thyroidectomy soon after is likely to reduce the risk of abscess formation in these goitres.
TI  - [In vitro activity of trovafloxacin in 238 respiratory pathogens].
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 238 clinical isolates obtained from respiratory specimens were compared with ciprofloxacin. Fifty-four Haemophilus influenzae, 58 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 40 Moraxella catarrhalis, 21 Streptococcus pyogenes, 25 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 40 Staphylococcus aureus (21 methicillin resistant and 19 methicillin susceptible) were studied. The MIC was determined following NCCLS recommendations. Ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin MIC90 was 0.016 mg/l and 0.016 mg/l for H. influenzae, 4 mg/l and 0. 25 mg/l for S. pneumoniae, </=0.008 mg/l and </=0.008 mg/l for M. catarrhalis, 0.5 mg/l and 0.064 mg/l for S. pyogenes, 0.064 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l for K. pneumoniae, 16 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 mg/l and 0.032 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. According to this data, trovafloxacin showed better in vitro activity than ciprofloxacin in the Gram-positive pathogen studied and similar activity against the Gram-negatives tested.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pathogenic microflora: data of the bacteriological laboratory at the antituberculosis clinic].
AB  - A total of 426 cultures for nonspecific organisms, made at the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Antituberculosis Dispensary, were analyzed. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were most common among the isolated pathogens. Evaluation of antibiotic sensitivity by using the disks showed augmentin, cefuroxime axetil, and ciprofloxacin to be most effective. Streptomycin and rifampicin resistance of pathogens was highest. In patients with tuberculosis, the non-tuberculosis flora showed resistance to the drugs widely used in general practice (ampicillin, carbenicillin, oxacillin, lincomycin, erythromycin). Among macrolides, rovamycin was more effective than erythromycin. It is concluded that when wide-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed, new and potent drugs should be used in a tuberculosis hospital.
TI  - [Group A Streptococcus pyomyositis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyomyositis is a group of infectious diseases involving muscle tissue. Staphylococcus aureus is usually the causal agent. Group A Streptococcus infections are uncommonly isolated in pyomyositis. Streptococcal pyomyositis can be distinguished by its severity. Death rate may be as high as 50%. CASE REPORTS: Diagnosis of cervical pyomyositis was made in 2 patients on the basis of ultrasound and computerized tomography findings. Group A Streptococcus was isolated from local samples. The diagnosis was confirmed at surgery. Host defense mechanisms were not deficient in either patient. Outcome was favorable in both patients after antibiotic therapy. DISCUSSION: Because of the seventy of group A streptococcal pyomyositis, early diagnosis is essential for prognosis. Ultrasound and computerized tomography are very helpful. Group A streptococcal pyomyositis should be considered as a life-threatening disease.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor combined with a penicillin antibiotic, were studied in pediatrics and the following results were obtained. 1) Serum concentration and urinary excretion of TAZ/PIPC after intravenous administration at a dose of 46 mg/kg to one child were investigated. Serum half-lives were 0.5 hours for TAZ and 0.6 hours for PIPC, while the urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration, were 61.6% and 56.3% respectively. 2) TAZ/PIPC was administered at a dose of 46.0-73.5 mg/kg t.i.d. for 3-13 days to 10 patients, 6 with respiratory infection, 1 with pharyngotonsillitis, 1 with pertussis and 2 with soft tissue infection of skin. Clinical response were excellent in 5 cases and good in 5 cases, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) isolated from 2 patients were eradicated after the treatment. As for adverse reaction, mild skin rash was observed in 1 case but disappeared within 2 days after withdrawal of the drug. As for abnormal laboratory test results decrease in neutrophiles and increase in eosinophiles in each 1 case were observed, which were, however, normalized after administration. From the above results, tazobactam/piperacillin was considered to be a useful antibiotic in the pediatric field.
TI  - Isolation, cDNA cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros.
AB  - An antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros immunized with Escherichia coli. Based on the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed to clone rhinocerosin cDNA. As a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. The complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cDNA clone by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. Rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus but not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results of reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the Malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. In addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the Malpighian tubule and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.
TI  - Comparison of four antibiotics in a murine model of necrotizing cutaneous infections caused by toxigenic Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The ability of azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, or cefuroxime to modify the course of group A streptococcus (GAS) or Staphylococcus aureus soft-tissue infection was compared in a mouse model. In GAS-infected mice given azithromycin, fewer demonstrated dermonecrosis (P = 0.0004); the average weight gain was greater (P < 0.05) and the latency to sustained weight gain was shorter (P < 0.05) than for animals given other antibiotics. All antibiotics were effective against S. aureus infections, with no significant differences among treatments in parameters evaluated. The effectiveness of azithromycin in GAS-infected mice may be related to the high and sustained tissue concentrations achieved with this antibiotic.
TI  - Toxin-mediated streptococcal and staphylococcal disease.
AB  - After several decades of seemingly decreasing virulence, streptococcal and staphylococcal infections have reemerged as a major source of morbidity and mortality. Within the past 2 decades, not only have well-established diseases such as rheumatic fever begun to reappear. but also many new entities, such as toxic shock syndrome, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema, and recalcitrant erythematous desquamating disorder have been described. Central to the renewed importance of these bacteria has been the production of circulating toxins, which often function as superantigens in causing the clinical manifestations, morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases.

TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis media in Costa Rican children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing number of resistant middle ear pathogens reported from different centers worldwide, an active surveillance of the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens is required for proper antimicrobial recommendations among different regions of the world. OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from Costa Rican children with acute otitis media. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1997 a diagnostic tympanocentesis was performed in 398 Costa Rican patients with acute otitis media. Middle ear fluid was obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the E-test technique in those isolates obtained between October, 1995, and January, 1997. RESULTS: The most common pathogens cultured were Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (4%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4%). Moraxella catarrhalis was uncommon. Beta-lactamase production was low (3.7%) among the H. influenzae isolates but frequent among the Staphylococcus aureus (57.1%) and M. catarrhalis (100%) strains. Overall 9 of 46 S. pneumoniae isolates (19.6%) exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin of which 8 isolates (17.4%) showed intermediate and one strain (2.2%) high level resistance. Among the penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to the following antimicrobials was: 81%, azithromycin; 89%, clarithromycin; and 100%, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Among the penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates the percentage of susceptible strains was 89% for azithromycin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone and 67% for TMP-SMX. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this microbiologic information the agents considered first line drugs in the treatment of acute otitis media in Costa Rica remain amoxicillin or TMP-SMX.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Mobilization of potent plasma bactericidal activity during systemic bacterial challenge. Role of group IIA phospholipase A2.
AB  - Extracellular mobilization of Group IIA 14-kD phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in glycogen-induced rabbit inflammatory peritoneal exudates is responsible for the potent bactericidal activity of the inflammatory fluid toward Staphylococcus aureus (1996. J. Clin. Invest. 97:250-257). Because similar levels of PLA2 are induced in plasma during systemic inflammation, we have tested whether this gives rise to plasma bactericidal activity not present in resting animals. Baboons were injected intravenously (i.v.) with a lethal dose of Escherichia coli and plasma or serum was collected before and at hourly intervals after injection. After infusion of bacteria, PLA2 levels in plasma and serum rose > 100-fold over 24 h to approximately 1 microg PLA2/ml. Serum collected at 24 h possessed potent bactericidal activity toward S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and encapsulated E. coli not exhibited by serum collected from unchallenged animals. Bactericidal activity toward S. aureus and S. pyogenes was nearly completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody to human Group IIA PLA2 and addition of purified human Group IIA PLA2 to prechallenge serum conferred potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal activity equal to that of the 24 h post-challenge serum. PLA2-dependent bactericidal activity was enhanced approximately 10x by factor(s) present constitutively in serum or plasma. Bactericidal activity toward encapsulated E. coli was accompanied by extensive bacterial phospholipid degradation mediated, at least in part, by the mobilized Group IIA PLA2 but depended on the action of other bactericidal factors in the 24-h serum. These findings further demonstrate the contribution of Group IIA PLA2 to the antibacterial potency of biological fluids and suggest that mobilization of this enzyme during inflammation may play an important role in host defense against invading bacteria.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - The efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  - There is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "Oral Health for a Healthy Life" proposed for the 1994 World Health Day. In this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly Listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. Listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Helicobacter pylori, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. Bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to Listerine. When saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of Listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced to 1%. When Listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. This was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of Listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. The use of antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. In Japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. For the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. Indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activities of sanfetrinem cilexetil, a new oral tricyclic antibiotic.
AB  - The in vivo antibacterial activities of a new oral trinem, sanfetrinem cilexetil  (a prodrug of sanfetrinem), were evaluated in comparison with those of cefdinir and amoxicillin. Sanfetrinem cilexetil showed potent efficacy against experimental murine septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli and against murine respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Likewise, in murine models of respiratory infection by penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, sanfetrinem cilexetil was more effective than amoxicillin in reducing the number of bacteria in infected lungs. These results were reflected in its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma.
TI  - Craniofacial necrotizing fasciitis secondary to sinusitis.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare condition which usually affects the trunk, perineum and limbs. Head and neck involvement is very uncommon and in most cases it is secondary to orbital or dental infection. We report a case of craniofacial necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) secondary to a maxillary sinusitis. The patient was treated intensively with antibiotics, surgical procedures and life-support measures. Despite all efforts, the patient died one week after admission. This case highlights early diagnosis and aggressive management as decisive factors for the outcome of the patient.
TI  - A microbiologist's view of factors contributing to infection.
AB  - Why some patients develop postoperative surgical wound infection and others do not remains a mystery. There are many risk factors for infection, and mathematical scoring systems are often good predictors of infection; yet, some patients with a plethora of risk factors fail to develop surgical site infections. Even patients with established abdominal infection do not automatically develop wound infection. Early experimental work, now confirmed in the clinical setting, dictates that bacteria must be in the wound to cause infection; the minimal infecting dose will depend on the environmental conditions in the wound. The presence of foreign bodies, trauma, hematoma, etc., will enhance the effect of the inoculum; therefore, surgical debridement and careful surgery are necessary to reinforce the host defenses. Some bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, have a greater propensity to cause infection, so extensive infection-control practices are necessary to prevent or contain these pathogens. To minimize the risk of surgical site infection, individual patient risk factors must be identified and modified whenever possible. The patient should be prepared for the operation and appropriate skin antiseptics should be used on the operative site. The patient should be considered for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and, if appropriate, bowel preparation should be carried out. Care and attention to the theater operating environment is important, especially for cases in which airborne transmission of bacteria should be controlled, e.g., ultraclean air systems for implant surgery. In elective surgery, the source of bacteria that cause infection is either the patient's normal flora (e.g., skin or bowel), i.e., endogenous, or the surgical staff or environment, i.e., exogenous. Surgical expertise and theater discipline are essential components in the fight against surgical sepsis.
TI  - Increasing incidence of streptococcal impetigo in atopic dermatitis.
AB  - Streptococcal impetigo associated with atopic dermatitis has dramatically increased from 1989 to 1994 in outpatients visiting our hospital, totalling 174 cases. The most frequent causative agents were group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, 70.7%) followed by group G (19.5%) and group B (9.8%). Streptococcus was isolated singly in 28.2% of cases and in concomitant with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 71.8%. Major clinical features of streptococcal impetigo, especially caused by group A streptococci, were non-bullous pustules with thick crusted ceiling. Impetigo caused by group G or B streptococci generally formed smaller sized pustules of fewer numbers. Impetigo was usually present, associated with severe eczematous lesions. Various degrees of fever were noticed in 32.8% (group A, 39.8%; group G, 17.6%; group B, 11.8%) during active stages. The lesions on the face often resembled Kaposi's varicelliform eruption in any group. Systemic antimicrobial agents were administered in 71.3% of cases and the remainder were treated with topical antibiotics (oxytetracycline hydrochloride) or disinfectants (povidone-iodine). Recurrence occurred within a month in 38.0% of cases treated with topical agents only and in 17.7% treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the results of treatment seem to indicate that cephems, as well as penicillins, are the first choice of treatment for streptococcal impetigo.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin and tazobactam combination against clinically significant bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactum which is not among the routinely tested antibiotic at the Public Health Bacteriology Laboratory, Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe was evaluated for its activity against bacterial pathogens using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Piperacillin/tazobactum showed superior in-vitro activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria when compared with routinely tested antibiotics such as gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and clindamycin and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Ciprofloxacin showed in-vitro activity comparable to that of tazobactam/piperacillin. Specifically, 96% of gram positive isolates (comprising Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. For gram negative organisms, 98% of Haemophilus influenzae Shigella spp, Klebsiella spp were also sensitive to the combination. The broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam shows that the potential of the drug combination for the treatment of infections caused by diverse microorganisms should not be underestimated. We recommend its inclusion in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing in our hospital.
TI  - Identification and characterization of staphylococcal enterotoxin types G and I from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcal enterotoxins are exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus that  possess emetic and superantigenic properties. Prior to this research there were six characterized enterotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin types A to E and H (referred to as SEA to SEE and SEH). Two new staphylococcal enterotoxin genes have been identified and designated seg and sei (staphylococcal enterotoxin types G and I, respectively). seg and sei consist of 777 and 729 nucleotides, respectively, encoding precursor proteins of 258 (SEG) and 242 (SEI) deduced amino acids. SEG and SEI have typical bacterial signal sequences that are cleaved to form toxins with 233 (SEG) and 218 (SEI, predicted) amino acids, corresponding to mature proteins of 27,043 Da (SEG) and 24,928 Da (SEI). Biological activities for SEG and SEI were determined with recombinant S. aureus strains. SEG and SEI elicited emetic responses in rhesus monkeys upon nasogastric administration and stimulated murine T-cell proliferation with the concomitant production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), as measured by cytokine enzyme-linked immunoassays. SEG and SEI are related to other enterotoxins of S. aureus and to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) and streptococcal superantigen (SSA) of Streptococcus pyogenes. Phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities were performed on related staphylococcal and streptococcal protein toxins to group SEG and SEI among the characterized toxins. SEG is most similar to SpeA, SEB, SEC, and SSA (38 to 42% amino acid identity), while SEI is most similar to SEA, SEE, and SED (26 to 28% amino acid identity). Polyclonal antiserum was generated against purified histidine-tagged SEG and SEI (HisSEG and HisSEI). Immunoblot analysis of the enterotoxins, toxic-shock syndrome toxin 1, and SpeA with antiserum prepared against HisSEG and HisSEI revealed that SEG shares some epitopes with SEC1 while SEI does not.
TI  - Mucin gene (MUC 2 and MUC 5AC) upregulation by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. In partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the Gram-negative organism Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the MUC 2 mucin gene [J.-D. Li, A. Dohrman, M. Gallup, S. Miyata, J. Gum, Y. Kim, J. Nadel, A. Prince, C. Basbaum, Transcriptional activation of mucin by P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94 (1997) 967-972]. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin genes other than MUC 2 are so regulated and whether Gram-positive organisms also contain mucin stimulatory activity. Results from in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays showed that P. aeruginosa upregulates MUC 5AC as well as MUC 2 in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. The upregulation of both genes by P. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. In addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. These data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.
TI  - A multicentre, double-blind, randomised study comparing the efficacy and safety of oral levofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - A multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial in Latin America compared oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 7 days with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days in 272 patients with uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections. Among 253 subjects evaluable for clinical efficacy (129 levofloxacin, 124 ciprofloxacin), clinical success (cure and improvement) was observed in 96.1% of levofloxacin-treated patients and in 93.5% of ciprofloxacin-treated patients. Overall, bacteriological eradication rates by pathogen were 93.2% and 91.7%, respectively. Levofloxacin eradicated 94% (66/70) of Staphylococcus aureus and 94% (17/18) of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, compared with 93% (70/75) and 92% (12/13) for ciprofloxacin. Microbiological eradication rates by subject were approximately 93% and 90% for the levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. Drug-related adverse events were reported by 8.9% of those receiving levofloxacin and 8.2% of those administered ciprofloxacin. Findings support the efficacy of oral levofloxacin for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to S. aureus and S. pyogenes.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, against species representative of respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of BAY 12-8039, a novel 8-methoxy-quinolone,  was compared with those of other quinolones, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime and erythromycin against species commonly implicated in respiratory tract infections as well as viridans group streptococci. The new compound was highly active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90 0.5 and MIC50 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci (MIC90 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively), group A streptococci (MIC90 0.25 microgram/ml), M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.125 microgram/ml) and H. influenzae (MIC90 0.063 microgram/ml), irrespective of beta-lactamase production. It was, however, less active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively). The new compound demonstrated bactericidal activity at concentrations 2, 4, 8 times the MIC against representative isolates of the above collection. At a concentration of eight times the MIC, the frequency of spontaneous resistance ranged from 2.5 x 10(-7) to < 4 x 10(-8). These results suggested that BAY 12-8039 would be a promising agent for the eradication of respiratory tract pathogens and that clinical trials assessing its efficacy for the management of infections caused by these organisms are warranted.
TI  - [Invasive streptococcal infection as a complication of chickenpox].
AB  - Two girls aged 11 months and 6 years, presented with an invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection during the course of primary varicella. The infant had severe cellulitis of the left arm and leg, fever and bacteraemia. She developed osteomyelitis of ulna and tibia. The 6-year-old girl had a fever > 38.5 degrees C, hypotension, an acute respiratory distress syndrome, liver function abnormalities, and positive cultures of blood and joints. Her clinical picture was compatible with a GAS-associated toxic shock syndrome. If during the course of primary varicella persistent fever, secondary fever or pain in one or more extremities occurs, invasive bacterial infection by GAS or Staphylococcus aureus should be considered, even in the absence of skin infection or cellulitis.
TI  - Tungiasis among five communities in south-western Trinidad, West Indies.
AB  - The prevalences of Tunga penetrans Linn. within the five townships of Granville,  Fullerton, Icacos, Coromandel and Cedros in south-western Trinidad, West Indies, as determined by physical examination of all inhabitants present during the survey, were 17.0% (38/223 subjects), 15.7% (36/237), 31.4% (102/325), 17.4% (42/242) and 17.9% (50/280), respectively. The rate in Icacos was significantly higher than in the other four sites (P < 0.001). Not only were males more likely to be infected than females in all five study sites (P < 0.0007) but chigoe-flea burdens were also higher in males than in females (P < 0.012), with mean (S.D.) burdens of 5.44 (2.54) fleas/male infected subject and 2.38 (2.00) fleas/female infected subject. Feet were significantly more infected than other areas of the body (P < 0.001). Analysis of variance revealed that the interactions between prevalence of chigoe-flea infection and geographical location (P = 0.0058) and between sex of infected subject and site of infection (P = 0.0109) were highly significant but that between geographical location and sex of infected subject was not significant (P > 0.30). At least seven species of bacteria, with varying sensitivities to antibiotics, were isolated from 16 patients with sepsis associated with their T. penetrans infections: Streptococcus pyogenes, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (not group A), Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and a Bacillus species. Closteridium tetani was not isolated.
TI  - Anhydrolide macrolides. 2. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2,3-anhydro-6-O-methyl 11,12-carbazate erythromycin A analogues.
AB  - A series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11, 12-cyclic carbazate analogues was prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. These 2,3-anhydro macrolides were found to be potent antibacterial agents in vitro against macrolide-susceptible organisms including Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, Streptococcus pyogenes EES61, and Streptococcuspneumoniae ATCC6303. These compounds were also very active against some organisms that show macrolide resistance (S. aureus A5177, S. pyogenes PIU2584, and S. pneumoniae 5649). The compounds generally showed poor activity against organisms with constitutive MLS resistance. Selected compounds were evaluated in vivo in mouse protection studies. Although most of the compounds tested in vivo showed poor efficacy, two compounds, 38 and 57, were more active than clarithromycin against S. pneumoniae ATCC6303.
TI  - Anhydrolide macrolides. 1. Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2,3-anhydro-6-O-methyl 11,12-carbamate erythromycin A analogues.
AB  - A series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11, 12-carbamate analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. These compounds were found to be potent antibacterial agents against Gram-positive organisms in vitro, many having MIC values below 1 microg/mL for the macrolide-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as improved activity compared to erythromycin A against the inducibly MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B)-resistant organisms. Structure-activity studies revealed that arylalkyl carbamates with two and four carbon atoms between the aromatic moiety and carbamate nitrogen have the best in vitro activity. All of the C-10 epi analogues evaluated were found to have substantially less activity than the corresponding natural C-10 isomer. Several analogues demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against the constitutively resistant S.aureus A-5278, S. pneumoniae5979, and S.pyogenes 930. However, despite potent in vitro activity, these analogues showed only moderate in vivo activity in mouse protection studies.
TI  - Peripheral blood lymphocytes from psoriatic patients are hyporesponsive to beta-streptococcal superantigens.
AB  - The strong association of acute guttate psoriasis and streptococcal throat infection, together with the preferential use of T cells expressing a particular T-cell receptor, has suggested a role for bacterial superantigens in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We examined the proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), obtained from patients with psoriasis and from healthy controls, to streptococcal superantigens, cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein (CAP) and secretion-type CAP (SCAP), isolated from group A, beta-haemolytic streptococci. PBLs from patients with psoriasis showed significantly less response to SCAP and CAP than those from healthy controls. Because there was no difference between psoriatic patients and controls in the proliferative response of PBLs to staphylococcal enterotoxin A or E (SEA, SEE) or the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), these findings strongly suggest that the reduced reactivity to the streptococcal superantigens seems to reflect anergy of a population of PBLs to the superantigens. As the CAP used in the present study stimulates V beta 8 T cells selectively, we further examined the proliferation of V beta 8 T cells after such stimulation using flow cytometry. V beta 8 T cells obtained from three of four psoriatic patients failed to proliferate in the presence of CAP, whereas they proliferated vigorously in the presence of SEE, which activates V beta 8 T cells, confirming the specific hyporesponsiveness of PBLs from psoriatic patients to streptococcal superantigens. We then determined the effects of serum factors on the suppressed response of PBLs to the streptococcal superantigens with SCAP or CAP. It was partially restored when PBLs were cultured with sera obtained from healthy subjects, although the responses were still significantly lower than those of the healthy controls. In contrast, psoriatic sera markedly suppressed the proliferative response of PBLs from healthy controls to CAP or SCAP, but showed no suppression of the proliferative response of PBLs to SEA. Because these findings suggest the presence of specific inhibitory factors in psoriatic sera, we examined whether the inhibitory effect was caused by antisuperantigen antibody. However, no significant increase was detected in antibody titre to CAP in psoriatic sera, as has been noted in sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The present results show for the first time the hyporesponsiveness of PBLs to streptococcal superantigens and the presence of serum inhibitors that specifically inhibit T-cell response to the superantigens in psoriatic patients. These findings suggest a pathological role for streptococcal infections in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic treatment of head and neck abscesses in children.
AB  - The clinical data, microbiological results and antibiotic treatment of 65 children who have required incision and drainage of suppurative head and neck abscesses was retrospectively investigated with the aim of developing a more effective clinical protocol of treatment, improving speed of resolution and rationalizing the need for surgical intervention. A positive culture grew in 78% of children and of these 45% were Staphylococcus aureus, 9% Streptococcus pyogenes, and 8% atypical mycobacteria. Only 3% of the samples grew anaerobes. All isolates of S. aureus were sensitive to Flucloxacillin and all isolates of S. pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin. All anaerobes were Metronidazole sensitive. In 40% of the children there were no localizing symptoms which could guide the treatment, therefore we recommend Flucloxacillin and Metronidazole as the antibiotic regimen of choice in acute suppurative lymphadenitis. The increasing incidence of atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis is noteworthy.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Staphylococcus aureus and Treptococcus pyogenes murD genes encoding uridine diphosphate N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligases.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (MurD), a cytoplasmic  peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme, catalyzes the ATP-dependent addition of D-glutamate to an alanyl residue of the UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine precursor, generating the dipeptide. The murD gene was cloned from both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sequence analysis of the S. aureus murD gene revealed an open reading frame of 449 amino acids. The deduced aa sequence of S. aureus MurD is highly homologous to MurD from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and St. pyogenes. Recombinant MurD protein from both S. aureus and St. pyogenes was separately overproduced in E. coli and purified as His-tagged fusion. Both recombinant enzymes catalyzed the ATP-dependent addition of D-glutamate to the precursor sugar peptide.
TI  - Bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (Haj) season in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and type of RTI-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. METHOD: A total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (Haj to Makkah Al-Mukarama, Saudi Arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. All 761 throat swabs of both Haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause respiratory infections. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. During the 1991 Haj season Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). In the 1992 Haj season Klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). Screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. Cultures from the 761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. Viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza A and adenovirus being the most common viruses. CONCLUSION: The pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza A and adenovirus predominated. Thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of mouth rinses on oral bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal efficacy of two types of Listerine; Listerine and Cool Mint Listerine, and povidone iodine on oral microorganisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Helicobacter pylori and Candida albicans were examined. Most of the oral bacteria were killed completely by a 10-sec exposure to Listerine or Cool Mint Listerine. H. pylori, MRSA and C. albicans were also reduced by a 30-sec exposure to the Listerine mouth rinse. Bacteria in dental plaque were decreased by exposure to Listerine, Cool Mint Listerine, and povidone iodine for 30 seconds. Mouthwashing with Listerine for 30 seconds resulted in a decrease to approximately 1/100 of the viable bacterial counts in saliva. These bactericidal effects against bacteria in saliva and dental plaque indicated that Listerine and Cool Mint Listerine antiseptic are useful in oral cavity as antiseptic mouth rinses.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Triggering of renal tissue damage in the rabbit by IgG Fc-receptor-positive group A streptococci.
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that streptococcal IgG Fc receptors (FcR) act to  elicit circulating anti-IgG as well as renal glomerular deposition of IgG in rabbits immunized with group A streptococci (GAS). In order to study if other FcR-positive bacteria might have similar effects, rabbits were immunized with either group G streptococci (GGS; strain G148) or Staphylococcus aureus (strain Cowan I) for two periods of 8 and 6 weeks, respectively. At the end of immunization, circulating anti-IgG was found in 6 of 20 (30%) and 4 of 19 (21%) animals receiving G148 and Cowan I, respectively, compared to all 28 receiving FcR-positive GAS strains of types M1, M4, M15 or M22 (p < 0.05 for both comparisons); furthermore, anti-IgG appeared earlier and at higher levels in the GAS groups. Weak glomerular IgG deposits occurred in 5 out of 10 (50%) and 2 out of 8 (25%) animals immunized with G148 and Cowan I, respectively. In contrast, all 11 rabbits examined, given GAS of types M1 or M15, displayed heavy deposits. None of four control animals immunized with either of two FcR-negative strains, GAS type T27 or group B streptococci (GBS) type Ia, exhibited any renal IgG deposits or circulating anti-IgG. Renal tissue materials from rabbits immunized with any of the four FcR-positive GAS strains showed strong inflammatory and degenerative glomerular changes, compatible with the picture seen in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). Only transient renal changes were found in those rabbits immunized with G148 or Cowan I, or the controls injected with the FcR-negative strains, GAS type T27 or GBS. Thus, only the FcR-positive GAS strains showed capacity to induce high levels of anti-IgG, pronounced tissue deposition of IgG as well as irreversible glomerular changes. Our experimental data suggest that streptococcal IgG FcR activity might play an important role in triggering APSGN.
TI  - A novel erythromycin resistance methylase gene (ermTR) in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Erythromycin resistance among streptococci is commonly due to target site modification by an rRNA-methylating enzyme, which results in coresistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics (MLSB resistance). Genes belonging to the ermAM (ermB) gene class are the only erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) genes in Streptococcus pyogenes with MLSB resistance that have been sequenced so far. We identified a novel erm gene, designated ermTR, from an erythromycin-resistant clinical strain of S. pyogenes (strain A200) with an inducible type of MLSB resistance. The nucleotide sequence of ermTR is 82.5% identical to ermA, previously found, for example, in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Our finding provides the first sequence of an erm gene other than ermAM that mediates MLSB resistance in S. pyogenes.
TI  - Unexpected high prevalence of secondary bacterial infection in patients with mycetoma.
AB  
TI  - Rapid lysis of gram-positive cocci for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using achromopeptidase.
AB  - To adapt pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to a busy clinical laboratory, we evaluated the use of achromopeptidase (ACP) as the sole agent for lysis of a variety of gram-positive cocci. Growth in an appropriate broth media was adjusted to a 3.0 McFarland density before aliquotting for washing and plug preparation. ACP incorporated into the agarose plugs, or added to the buffer solution, lysed cells in < 1 h when suspended in a Tris-NaCl buffer. Two 30-min washes in a Tris-EDTA buffer were sufficient to remove cellular debris without additional deproteination. Final PFGE results were obtained in approximately 48 h, including the initial broth subculturing.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - Periocular necrotizing fasciitis: a review of five cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to display a spectrum of clinical presentations of periocular necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococci and to discuss recent trends and treatment of this disease. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: A case series of five patients (four female and one male) was seen between July 1990 and January 1995 in four university centers. All had clinical evidence of periocular necrotizing fasciitis and grew group A streptococci on wound cultures or had serologic evidence of streptococcal infection. Details of patient presentation, treatment, and outcome are examined. RESULTS: The five patients showed a spectrum of clinical severity from a necrotizing infection confined to the eyelid to a potentially fatal, severe shock-like syndrome characterized by sepsis and multiorgan system failure. A history of trauma often was absent. Patients were treated successfully by a combination of appropriate antibiotics and surgical debridement. CONCLUSIONS: Group A streptococci can cause severe necrotizing infections of the eyelids. Early recognition and prompt treatment can be essential to these patients' survival.
TI  - In vitro activity of trimethoprim alone compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species associated with upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used to treat various respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, for many patients, intolerance of the sulfonamide component precludes use of this combination. This study examined the activity of trimethoprim alone in comparison to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species implicated in respiratory tract infections. For Haemophilus influenzae, minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim were equal to or one dilution greater than those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with 56 of 58 strains inhibited by the former at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. All oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 96.7% of Streptococcus pyogenes were inhibited by trimethoprim < or = 2 micrograms/ml. In contrast, only 50% of Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by this concentration of trimethoprim, whereas 93.3% were susceptible to the combination at < or = 2/38 micrograms/ml. All oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and all Moraxella catarrhalis were resistant to trimethoprim, although many of the former and all of the latter were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - The postantibiotic effect of fusidic acid against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE) of fusidic acid was tested for six strains of Staphylococcus aureus and four strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. The maximum PAE that could be achieved was more than 3 h, but at concentrations of antibiotic attainable in humans, the PAE was less than 2 h. Additional experiments were performed in albumin, to examine the effect of the strong protein binding of fusidic acid on the MIC and PAE. MICs were increased, but at the same multiple of the MIC, PAEs were similar to those performed in Mueller-Hinton broth.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility testing of topical antimicrobial agents used in pediatric burn patients: comparison of two methods.
AB  - One hundred and seventy-seven bacterial isolates obtained from pediatric burn victims were tested for in vitro susceptibility against bacitracin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, nitrofurazone, and mupirocin by two methods: standard microbroth dilution and Nathan's agar well diffusion (NAWD). Nitrofurazone had the broadest spectrum of activity. Mupirocin was the most potent agent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Silver sulfadiazine showed activity against gram-positive organisms and higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and smaller zone sizes were seen for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli. Bacitracin showed activity against S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes by the microbroth method; activity could not be assessed by NAWD. Mafenide acetate had the highest MICs for all isolates tested. Correlation between methods for all isolates tested was best for mupirocin and nitrofurazone. NAWD was labor intensive and difficult to interpret; MIC method was easy to perform and reproducible. Clinical correlation is necessary to establish breakpoints for interpretation of test results.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains. The results are summarized as follows. The specimens from 343 patients were cultured and 595 strains of bacteria were isolated and identified. Oral doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg of CDTR-PI were clinically effective at high percentages, 85.1% and 89.5%, respectively, of treated patients. CDTR-PI at 3 mg/kg orally was clinically effective in 80.8% of patients with PCG intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) infections, 80.0% of those with PCG susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) infections, 81.8% of those with H. influenzae infections and 78.3% of those with M. (B.) catarrhalis infections among the infections by major causative agents. The frequent isolates included S. pneumoniae accounting for 33.1%, H. influenzae accounting for 32.1%, M. (B.) catarrhalis accounting for 17.6% and S. pyogenes accounting 3.7% of all the isolates. PISP accounted for 16.1% of all the isolates and for 49.8% of the isolates of S. pneumoniae, and were isolated from 28.6% of the 343 patients. The isolation of PISP was frequent from children of 4 and under especially, and especially frequent from those below age 2. Of the isolates of S. pneumoniae, the biotype frequencies among PSSP were in the order of type I > type II > type III, while those among PISP were in the order of type I < type II with none of type III. Bacteriologically, an eradication rate of 89.4% was achieved with 3 mg/kg and 93.5% with 5 mg/kg of CDTR-PI.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.

TI  - Group A streptococcal bacteremia. A 10-year prospective study.
AB  - In this paper we present a prospective evaluation of 100 patients with Group A Streptococcal (GAS) bacteremia evaluated in our hospital over a 10-year period. Sixty-two patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU); all but 1 of these had an obvious cutaneous portal of entry related to the injection of illicit drugs. Twenty-seven patients had infectious metastasis, and the presence of septic pulmonary embolism was associated with suppurative phlebitis. Four of these patients had endocarditis. In the non-IVDU group, 24 patients had an underlying disease, and 12 were immunosuppressed. In 14 cases the infection was of hospital acquisition; in 35% infection was related to medical manipulations. Comparing the IVDU and non-IVDU groups, GAS bacteremia in IVDU patients is associated with a more benign outcome, a longer time of evolution before diagnosis, and a lower frequency of septic shock and mortality than in non-IVDU patients. Although in the univariate analysis GAS bacteremia was associated with several variables, in the multivariate analysis only the presence of shock and nosocomial acquisition of the infection were independently associated with a fatal outcome. Fifty-two patients were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 5 of these were in the non-IVDU group. During the last 5 years of study, GAS bacteremia in our hospital was 39 times more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in patients without HIV. Nine patients presented clinical criteria corresponding to Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), although its incidence was lower in the IVDU group. In the non-IVDU group, STSS was more frequent in patients with a necrotizing portal of entry, an age between 20 and 40 years, women, and when the origin of the infection was the skin or soft tissue. Six patients with STSS died, and death was associated with the presence of necrotizing lesions and lower counts of white cells, platelets, or hemoglobin.
TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - Serum concentrations and ex vivo inhibitory/bactericidal activity of clindamycin  after administration of two oral dosages.
AB  - Two dosages of clindamycin, 300 and 600 mg, were given orally to 10 patients each. The patients were admitted for minor elective surgery. Their mean age was 39.3 years; mean weight was 67.5 kg. None of them had taken antibiotics for at least 1 month. After administration of a single dose, blood samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after dosing. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method using Micrococcus luteus as test organism. Serum inhibitory and bactericidal activities against five isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined by the microdilution method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. The mean peak serum level was 3.4 mg/l for the 300-mg dose and 4.8 mg/l for the 600-mg dose. The mean reciprocal peak inhibitory titers for the 300-/600-mg doses were 13.7/23.8 and 15.2/34.7 against S. aureus and S. pyogenes, respectively. Most serum samples did not show bactericidal activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Increased intracellular survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis containing the Mycobacterium leprae thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase gene.
AB  - The thioredoxin (Trx) system of Mycobacterium leprae is expressed as a single hybrid protein containing thioredoxin reductase (TR) at its N terminus and Trx at its C terminus. This hybrid Trx system is unique to M. leprae, since in all other organisms studied to date, including other mycobacteria, both TR and Trx are expressed as two separate proteins. Because Trx has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species, we have investigated whether the TR-Trx gene product can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of mycobacteria by human mononuclear phagocytes and as such could contribute to mycobacterial virulence. The gene encoding M. leprae TR-Trx was cloned into the apathogenic, fast-growing bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Recombinant M. smegmatis containing the gene encoding TR-Trx was killed to a significantly lesser extent than M. smegmatis containing the identical vector with either no insert or a control M. leprae construct unrelated to TR-Trx. Upon phagocytosis, M. smegmatis was shown to be killed predominantly by oxygen-dependent macrophage-killing mechanisms. Coinfection of M. smegmatis expressing the gene encoding TR-Trx together with Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to be killed via oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms, revealed that the TR-Trx gene product interferes with the intracellular killing of this bacterium. A similar coinfection with Streptococcus pyogenes, known to be killed by oxygen-independent mechanisms, showed that the TR-Trx gene product did not influence the oxygen-independent killing pathway. The data obtained in this study suggest that the Trx system of M. leprae can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of intracellular bacteria and thus may represent one of the mechanisms by which M. leprae can deal with oxidative stress within human mononuclear phagocytes.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Clarithromycin. A review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients.
AB  - Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro  and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients. It is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. Absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. More than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. First-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. Drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. In addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. In dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. Clarithromycin was similar in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. Adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. Clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. It offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in US hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. The spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of BAY 12-8039 on gram-positive and gram-negative organisms as demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - Time-kill kinetics of BAY 12-8039 were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of BAY 12-8039 were studied on three strains each of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that BAY 12-8039 has marked activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions) and anaerobes. BAY 12-8039 also exhibited a postantibiotic effect of >1 h for all strains except one E. coli strain.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  - The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. As the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. Problematic pathogens include strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. Other important pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups B, C, and G, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of Listeria and Corynebacterium and Gram-positive anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. The novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.
TI  - [Severe streptococcal complications in varicella].
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in the incidence of group A beta hemolytic streptococcal  (GABHS) infections in children has been recently noted with a frequent association with varicella. CASE REPORTS: Two children, 3 and 4.5 years old, developed varicella. The first one was febrile and presented a phlyctene on his left foot. Few hours after his admission, he presented a septic shock; GABHS was isolated from blood. Despite immediate adapted antibiotherapy, he developed a right tibial osteomyelitis with abscess. The second child also developed varicella and was hospitalized because of fever, bad general condition, right cervical adenitis and edema on the left wrist. Edema rapidly extended to the hand and upper arm. One purulent lesion was noted on the upper arm from whom Staphylococcus aureus and GABHS were isolated. Blood samples were sterile. The clinical course was favorable with adapted antibiotherapy. A cutaneous desquamation was observed on the 9th day and we concluded that it was a GABHS cellulitis. CONCLUSION: These two cases confirm the recent report of increase in GABHS infections associated with varicella. Such complications must be looked for in patients with varicella remaining abnormally febrile and/or presenting unusual manifestations.
TI  - Summer mastitis experimentally induced by Hydrotaea irritans exposed to bacteria.
AB  - Summer mastitis is an acute suppurative bacterial infection of the udder in heifers and dry cows. To ascertain the possible role of flies in the transmission of the disease, experimental exposures of recipient heifers to Hydrotaea irritans previously exposed to bacteria were carried out. Flies were allowed to feed on secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis. The pathogens present were the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan cocci, Peptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacterioides species. The teats of eight heifers were exposed to flies with verified pathogen content. Two teats of each animal were deliberately damaged before fly exposure. One teat was cut, another pricked with insect needles to mimic insect bites. Two of the heifers developed summer mastitis in the quarters where teats had been cut. The bacterial species isolated from these quarters corresponded to those that had previously been fed to the flies. For the first time, it is now demonstrated that H.irritans is capable of transmitting summer mastitis pathogens and so causing summer mastitis in recipient heifers. Lesions on the teat orifice may be a predisposing factor in the development of the disease.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of streptolysin S expression is associated with altered  riboflavin metabolism in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 mutagenesis was used to create a mutant of Streptococcus pyogenes M type 3, designated ISS417, in which the ability to produce streptolysin S (SLS) and several other exoproteins was impaired. Concomitantly, the mutant became dependent upon riboflavin for growth and was able to grow in Todd Hewitt broth (THB) when supplemented with riboflavin or riboflavinrich yeast extract. The parent strain was apparently able to utilize THB-derived components as a substitute for riboflavin, while the mutant was not. Although the parent strain grew well in synthetic medium, it was unable to produce SLS, except when it was supplemented with a small amount of THB. Thus, a component of THB was able to "trigger" SLS formation in the parent strain. The mutant grew well in this medium, but was unable to produce SLS even when it was supplemented with THB. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that the ISS417 mutant harbours a single transposon insertion in its chromosome. Phage transduction experiments showed that the riboflavin dependency and the inability to make SLS phenotypes are co-transducible. The pleotrophic properties of the ISS417 mutant differ from those reported for insertional inactivation of the mga locus which regulates production of a number of surface proteins in S. pyogenes and the sar locus which regulates production of a number of exoproteins in Staphylococcus aureus. In view of the possibility that there exist a genetic linkage between the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and expression of the oxygen-stable SLS, we hypothesize that SLS has a role in the growth economy of S. pyogenes.
TI  - Study of use of cefdinir versus cephalexin for treatment of skin infections in pediatric patients. The Cefdinir Pediatric Skin Infection Study Group.
AB  - Three hundred ninety-four patients, aged 6 months to 12 years, entered a multicenter, randomized, controlled, investigator-blind study comparing cefdinir, 7 mg/kg of body weight twice a day, with cephalexin, 10 mg/kg four times a day, each given for 10 days. The most common infections treated were impetigo and secondary infection of preexisting dermatitis. The most common pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Two hundred thirty-one patients were microbiologically evaluable. Microbiologic eradication rates were 164 of 165 pathogens (99.4%) in the cefdinir group and 152 of 156 pathogens (97.4%) in the cephalexin group (P = 0.14). Clinical cure rates were 116 of 118 patients (98.3%) in the cefdinir group and 106 of 113 patients (93.8%) in the cephalexin group (P = 0.056). Sixteen percent of cefdinir patients and 11% of cephalexin patients experienced adverse events (P = 0.11), the most common being diarrhea, which affected 8% of the cefdinir group and 4% of the cephalexin group. Cefdinir appears to be an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - [Clinical study on azithromycin in 10% fine granules and 100mg capsules in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. The following results were obtained in our studies of AZM for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. MICs of AZM, erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. Among Gram-positive cocci, MICs of AZM ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). These MICs were similar to those of the other macrolides. Among Gram-negative bacilli, MICs of AZM were 0.05 micrograms/ml against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). These values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. Against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs of AZM were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. One strain of M. pneumoniae showed tolerance to AZM at MIC 25 micrograms/ml. The other agents exhibited higher MIC than AZM against this organism. 2. Plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. The patients received AZM at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. Drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after Day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. Urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules. Drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. Urinary excretion rates of AZM in three patients on capsules lied in a range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. Effectiveness of AZM in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. AZM was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. Effectiveness of AZM in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. AZM was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. AZM in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. AZM in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. As for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of AZM. One patient on AZM capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. As for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased WBC, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased GOT and GPT, one with increased GPT. They were all on fine granular form of AZM. As far as abnormalities found in patients administered with AZM in capsular form, two showed decreased WBC, one decreased WBC along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - [Efficacy of pefloxacin in the treatment of complicated relapsing erysipelas].
AB  - The effect of antimicrobial agents on the clinical and immunological indices was  comparatively studied in 30 patients with relapsing erysipelas complicated by pyoderma. The patients were treated with pefloxacin in a daily dose of 800 mg for 7-10 days (15 patients) and with the routine antibiotics such as benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and erythromycin (15 patients). The efficacy of the treatment was defined by disappearance of the clinical signs and normalization of the functional immunity status. The pefloxacin effect was evident at early stages of the treatment and observed at least for 3 months after the patient discharge from the hospital. Gradual elimination of the secondary immune deficiency in the convalescents due to sanitation of the infection chronic foci was recorded.
TI  - [Efficacy and tolerance of coamoxiclav in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in children].
AB  - Amoxyclav (amoxycillin/potassium clavulanate, A/PC) was used in the treatment of  55 children with acute bronchitis and pneumonia. The drug was administered in a dose of 20-40 mg/kg body weight a day in 3 portions. The treatment course was 4 to 10 days. The treatment was performed under careful clinicoroent-genologic control. The clinical picture of the disease in the children was characterized by a moderate process which made it possible to treat the children as outpatients. The clinical efficacy amounted to 90.5 per cent. The isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae proved to be susceptible to A/PC. It may be used as the 1st class agent in the treatment of children with lower respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Neutralization of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins and staphylococcal enterotoxins by antiserum to synthetic peptides representing conserved amino acid motifs.
AB  
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial action of cecropin and proline-arginine-rich peptides from pig intestine.
AB  - Two antimicrobial peptides, cecropin P1 (CP1), with a C-terminal carboxyl group,  and PR-39, with an amidated, C-terminus, are found in the small intestine of the pig. Each is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We have synthesized these peptides and several analogs, including the D-enantiomers and the retro sequences, each with a free or acetylated amino terminus. The CP1 amide was also prepared. The retro CP1 peptides were much less active than the parent CP1 peptide, confirming the importance of sequence or the amide bond and helix dipole direction, and the N alpha-acetyl peptides were also less active, indicating that a free amino terminus is essential for high activity. The ratio of the lethal concentration of L/D isomers of CP1 is less than 1 for Gram-negative, but greater than 1 for Gram-positive bacteria. PR-39 showed no significant chiral selectivity toward Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pyogenes, but the L/D ratio was high for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (66), and very high for Staphylococcus aureus (> 1000). In the latter case the lethal concentration for the D-isomer was 0.57 microM, whereas this organism was quite resistant to the L-isomer (> 600 microM). Thus the enantiomers of CP1 and PR-39 are not equally active for all species. In a plate assay with a very small log-phase inoculum of Staph aureus, D-PR-39 produced a clear zone of killing surrounded by a zone of stimulated growth. After prolonged incubation the two zones became one clear zone. Addition of D-PR-39 to the wells of a dense turbid plate of growing cells showed a cleared zone for each of the test organisms, indicating that PR-39 lyses the bacteria rather than simply inhibiting their multiplication.
TI  - Differentiation between bacterial species and sub-species by pyrolysis mass spectrometry of extracted DNA.
AB  - Whole cell samples from cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes were analysed by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and the results were compared with Py-MS-derived analyses of samples of DNA extracted from the same organisms. Py-MS analysis differentiated the four organisms in both circumstances. These results challenge previous assumptions that Py-MS is restricted to detecting phenotypic differences, although the basis for the differentiation of the DNA extracts has yet to be determined.
TI  - A highly discriminatory method for the direct comparison of two closely related bacterial populations by pyrolysis mass spectrometry.
AB  - The ability of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-MS) to discriminate between paired groups of closely related bacteria has been examined. The technique was challenged with increasing levels of biological difference; from that between different subcultures of the same isolate of Staphylococcus aureus, through that between separate isolates of the same strain and eventually to that between different staphylococcal species and Streptococcus pyogenes. By using an analytical method in which the spectral data from any two groups can be directly compared at a time, it was shown that Py-MS was capable of measuring statistically significant differences between staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes, between different Staphylococcus species and between two isolates of the same strain of S. aureus from different sources. Two subcultures of the same isolate were found to be indistinguishable. The differing magnitude of the Py-MS-derived differences corresponded to the "biological differences", being much larger between staphylococci and streptococci than between staphylococcal species and only just statistically significant between isolates of the same strain from different sources. The technique described allows the assessment of the magnitude and significance of Py-MS-derived differences between any two bacterial populations.
TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. A total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. Though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the 495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). In 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), Pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). Staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and Streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). Among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as S. suis, the major serotype was S. suis type 2 (35.4%). The remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). A total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.
TI  - Pre-septal cellulitis--varied clinical presentations.
AB  - Preseptal cellulitis has a typically benign course when treated with antibiotics, the clinical course depending on age of the patient, aetiology and the causative organism. In this study, 14 cases of preseptal cellulitis are documented with the age ranging from 2 to 55 years. The organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (7 cases), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case). In the remaining four patients no organism could be identified. All except four patients were cured within 6 weeks. Complications seen included lagophthalmos, lid abscess, cicatricial ectropion and lid necrosis in one patient each. The prognosis for preseptal cellulitis is good with appropriate antibiotics and surgical therapy.
TI  - An 18 year clinical review of septic arthritis from tropical Australia.
AB  - A retrospective study of 191 cases of septic arthritis was undertaken at Royal Darwin Hospital in the tropical north of Australia. Incidence was 9.2 per 100,000 overall and 29.1 per 100,000 in Aboriginal Australians (RR 6.6; 95% CI 5.0-8.9). Males were affected more than females (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1). There was no previous joint disease or medical illness in 54%. The commonest joints involved were the knee (54%) and hip (13%). Significant age associations were infected hips in those under 15 years and infected knees in those over 45 years. Seventy two percent of infections were haematogenous. Causative organisms included Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Streptococcus pyogenes (16%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (12%). Unusual infections included three melioidosis cases. Polyarthritis occurred in 17%, with N. gonorrhoeae (11/23) more likely to present as polyarthritis than other organisms (22/168) (OR 6.0; 95% CI 2.1-16.7). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed the hip to be at greater risk for S. aureus than other joints. Open arthrotomy was a more successful treatment procedure than arthroscopic washout or needle aspiration.
TI  - Detection of Fc receptor genes from Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A method based upon the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting genes encoding the Fc receptors of Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci is described. Primers were designed from the nucleotide sequences of the five Fc receptor genes encoding protein A, protein G, protein H, FcRA and protein V. Amplification products corresponding in size to the protein A and protein G genes were detected in S. aureus strain Cowan 1 and Streptococcus pyogenes strain G148, respectively, as expected. Str. pyogenes strain AR1 was shown to possess the type H receptor gene. Two clinical isolates of Str. pyogenes, strains IP-28 and ES-21L, were shown to possess genes for Fc receptor types FcRA and protein G, respectively. The identification of all these products was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Amplification of protein H genes from two other clinical isolates of streptococci, MS-4 and MS-38, yielded a product larger than expected and with a different restriction fragment pattern to strain AR1, indicating a new type of Fc receptor gene. This PCR method provides a DNA-based method for the determination of Fc receptor type in S. aureus and streptococci.
TI  - The toxic shock syndromes.
AB  - Because of the frequency with which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections occur, physicians are quite familiar with the diversity of their clinical presentations. In the 1970s, however, shock associated with multiorgan failure was described in menstruating female patients as well as in male patients following a variety of surgical procedures, such as rhinoplasty. This previously undescribed presentation of S. aureus infection, termed staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, was associated with unique strains of S. aureus. In the mid-1980s, the emergence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome was heralded by several case reports describing patients with group A streptococcal infections associated with shock and organ failure. This article compares the differences in the epidemiologic, clinical, and pathophysiologic features of the toxic shock syndromes.
TI  - Binding of Staphylococcus aureus to fibronectin and glycolipids on corneal surfaces.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens of bacterial corneal ulcers. It is generally believed that the first step necessary in the development of an infection involves adherence of bacteria to host tissue. The mechanisms by which staphylococci adhere to ocular epithelium have not yet been defined. An in vitro assay was used to measure binding of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to a cornea epithelial cell line. Reduction of the amount of cell-surface fibronectin by proteinase treatment decreased the adherence of S. pyogenes to a greater degree than that of S. aureus. The significantly higher number of staphylococci adhering to the cells as compared with S. pyogenes (P < 0.001) suggests the presence of additional binding sites for S. aureus. Using a thin-layer chromatogram overlay assay, we showed binding of S. aureus to various glycolipids extracted from corneal epithelial cells and corneal tissue. S. aureus was found to bind to gangliosides and asialo-GM1, whereas S. pyogenes did not bind to any of these complex lipids. The increased adherence potential of S. aureus due to the ability to bind to glycolipids may provide a selective advantage for S. aureus and explain the prevalence of this organism in bacterial corneal ulcers.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin in pediatric infections].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM) was studied for its concentrations in plasma and urine, efficacy and safety. 1. Plasma and urine samples were collected from one patient diagnosed as having Mycoplasma pneumonia for drug level determination. The drug was given once daily at 9.7 mg/kg body weight for three days. The drug concentrations in plasma was 0.149 microgram/ml in 12 hours after the start of the treatment, and 0.095 microgram/ml at the point of 24 hours after the end of the treatment. Urinary recovery rate up to 72 hours post-dosing was 6.39%. 2. The effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 19 patients with following diagnoses: pharyngitis in two patients, bronchitis in four, pneumonia in seven and Mycoplasma pneumonia in six. The drug was rated "excellent" in 11, "good" in seven, "poor" in one, resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%. 3. AZM eradicated two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in patients. 4. The AZM MIC's were 0.39 microgram/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, 0.20 microgram/ml against S. pneumoniae, < or = 0.0008 microgram/ml against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 5. One patient complained of mild diarrhea, while another showed a slight increase in eosinophils, suggesting an abnormal laboratory change. In conclusion, AZM was found useful in treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin using fine granules or capsules in the pediatric patients].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, in fine granules and in capsules  was studied for pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations. 1. Antibacterial activities. MIC profile of AZM was as follows: 0.78 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml against Staphylococcus aureus, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.10 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.10 approximately 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, < or = 0.025 approximately 0.39 microgram/ml against Moraxella(Branhamella) catarrhalis, 0.39 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and 0.20 approximately 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 2. Absorption and excretion. The elimination half-life of AZM after its administration at 10 mg/kg/day for three days was 28.1 approximately 46.1 hours. The cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 120 hours after start of treatment was 4.01 approximately 8.47%. 3. Clinical evaluation. AZM was given to 76 pediatric patients to treat following infections: pharyngitis in seven, tonsillitis in 11, bronchitis in 11, pneumonia in 19, Mycoplasma pneumonia in eight, scarlet fever in 13, infective enteritis in one, SSTI in four, and otitis media in two. Effectiveness of AZM was assessed in 75 patients and the drug was rated "excellent" or "good" in 71 resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.7%, 87.0% of the 46 cases indicated that AZM had eradicated bacteria identified before the treatment. One patient complained of moderate diarrhea which disappeared after treatment of anti-diarrheic. Abnormal laboratory changes were reported in 12 patients in the following: decreased leukocytes in eight, increased eosinophils in two, increased platelet count in one, and increased GPT in one. All cases of abnormality was deemed mild in severity and clinically insignificant.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Musculoskeletal complications of varicella.
AB  - Varicella, commonly known as chickenpox, is a common viral infection in children. An estimated 3.5 million cases occur annually in the United States. Serious musculoskeletal complications such as osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis, although uncommon, can be life and limb-threatening. The purpose of the current study was to determine the association between varicella and serious musculoskeletal complications necessitating operative treatment and to characterize these infections in otherwise healthy children. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who had been admitted to the Children's Hospital in San Diego because of varicella and its complications during the eleven-year period from 1984 through 1994. All records with an inpatient discharge diagnosis code for varicella were identified. Twenty-seven (6 per cent) of the 417 admissions for varicella were for musculoskeletal complications of the disease necessitating operative treatment. There were seven admissions for osteomyelitis, four for septic arthritis, five for necrotizing fasciitis, ten for a deep-tissue abscess, and one for toxic shock syndrome leading to multiple limb amputations. Seventy-nine (19 per cent) of the 417 admissions occurred in 1994. Eleven (41 per cent) of the twenty-seven musculoskeletal complications that led to operative treatment occurred in 1994, representing a significant increase in the number of such complications compared with the numbers in previous years of the study (p < 0.01). Bacterial pathogens were identified as the cause of twenty-five of the twenty-seven complications that led to operative treatment. Of these twenty-five, twenty-one (84 per cent) were found, on culture, to be caused by group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. This pathogen was the cause of the infection in five of the seven patients who had osteomyelitis while Staphylococcus aureus was the cause in only one. Group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was also the causative organism in two of the four patients who had septic arthritis, three of the five who had necrotizing fasciitis, and all ten who had a deep-tissue abscess. Nine of the eleven musculoskeletal complications leading to operative treatment in 1994 had group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcus as the causative organism. An understanding of the trends of and a high level of suspicion for potentially serious secondary infections in children who have varicella is necessary for prompt recognition and appropriate treatment.
TI  - Isolation, antimicrobial activities, and primary structures of hamster neutrophil defensins.
AB  - Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) neutrophil granules contain at least four microbicidal peptides belonging to the defensin family. These compounds were purified from granule acid extracts by reverse-phase chromatography and termed HaNP-1 to -4 (hamster neutrophil peptide). HaNP-1 and HaNP-3 revealed the most bactericidal activity, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.3 to 0.8 microg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. The HaNP-4 was always isolated in concentrations exceeding about 10 times the concentrations of other hamster peptides, but its antibacterial activity as well as that of HaNP-2 was relatively lower, probably as a result of conserved Arg residue substitutions. Other microorganisms were also tested, and generally, hamster defensins exhibited less potency against gram-negative bacteria. The amino acid sequence of hamster defensins showed a high percentage of identity to the sequence of mouse enteric defensins, reaching about 60% identical residues in the case of HaNP-3 and cryptdin 3.
TI  - [Gram-positive septic-toxic shock with bullae. Intraepidermal splitting as an indication of toxin effect].
AB  - A fourteen-year-old girl with acute otitis media died from gram positive sepsis and toxic shock despite intensive treatment. The definitive bacteriological results showed positive cultures for both S. aureus and S. pyogenes serotype A. In vitro the bacteria produced the bacterial superantigens TSST-1, enterotoxin A, enterotoxin C (S. aureus) and erythrogenic toxin C (S. pyogenes). The patient presented with large flaccid sterile bullae on her chest and arms as well as necrotizing fasciitis. Tzanck test showed keratinozytes without necrosis and no inflammatory cells. Frozen-section and conventional skin biopsy specimens revealed subcorneal intraepidermal cleavage. These cytological and histological findings are those of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and differ from bullous erysipelas or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Therefore bacterial exotoxins are most likely responsible for the intraepidermal blistering in our case just as in SSSS. Bullae are an unfavorable prognostic sign in gram positive toxic shock syndrome. Both Tzanck test and frozen-section biopsy are easy to perform and useful in the early and rapid recognition of gram positive bullous toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of azithromycin in pediatric infections].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM) was studied for its clinical efficacy in pediatric infections. The study on AZM was carried out in 43 patients whose diagnoses were given as follows: pharyngitis in five cases, tonsillitis in one, bronchitis in four, pneumonia in four, Mycoplasma pneumonia in 14, scarlet fever in nine, impetigo in four, pyodermia in one and Campylobacter enteritis in one. The patients received AZM once daily at 1.6 approximately 20.0 mg/kg body weight for three to five days. Effectiveness of AZM was evaluated in 39 cases and the drug was rated "excellent" in 15, "good" in 19, "fair" in one, "poor" in four, resulting in an efficacy rate of 87.2%. Twenty bacterial isolates were identified as causative isolates in 19 patients: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AZM eradicated 16 isolates but four persisted after therapy. One patient complained of loose stool, while two patients were found with decreases in white blood cell counts, and seven showed increases in eosinophils. However, no serious case of adverse event was reported.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of azithromycin in the  pediatric field].
AB  - Azithromycin (AZM), a new macrolide antibiotic, in fine granules and in capsules  was studied for pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation in the pediatric patients. Antibacterial activity of AZM against 43 clinical isolates: AZM exhibited slightly lower activity against Gram-positive bacteria and 2-8-fold higher activity against Gram-negative bacteria than erythromycin or clarithromycin. Plasma or urine samples were collected from eight patients receiving the drug in fine granular form, and two patients receiving it in capsules for the determination of drug levels. The elimination half-lives of AZM after administration at dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days were 50.0 and 51.2 hours for fine granules, and 41.5 hours for capsules. AUC0-infinity was 11.7 and 24.3 micrograms.hr/ml for fine granules, and 8.3 micrograms.hr/ml for capsules. The cumulative excretion rates up to 120 hours after the start of treatment were 8.24 and 13.84% for fine granules, and 3.83% for capsules. AZM was administered to 123 patients once daily at 3.7-20.0 mg/kg body weight over 3 to 5 days with reference to the standard dose of 10 mg/kg. The drug was used to treat patients with pharyngitis, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, pneumonia, mycoplasmal pneumonia, chlamydial pneumonia, otitis media, pertussis, intestinal infection, and SSTI. The effectiveness of AZM was evaluated in 109 cases. The drug was rated "excellent" in 65.1% of the patients and "good" in 29.4%, resulting in an efficacy rate of 94.5%. Furthermore, AZM eradicated 43 of 46 (93.5%) bacteria that had been identified before the treatment. Three patients complained of side effects of urticaria (1 case) and diarrhea (2 cases). Abnormal laboratory changes were reported as follows: decreased leukocyte (3 cases), increased eosinophil (5), increased platelet (2), increased eosinophil and platelet, elevated GPT (1), and elevated GOT and GPT (1). The abnormalities, however, were mild enough to raise no clinically significant problems. In conclusion, AZM in once daily regimen was effective and safe in treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - A multinational European survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five European countries. In terms of both MIC90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against Mycoplasma catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of Staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. Rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. Against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. Against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of MIC90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. In many cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. However, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. The findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus.
AB  - By screening a genomic lambda library of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, we have cloned and sequenced a gene, termed fnz, encoding a fibronectin (Fn)-binding protein called FNZ. On the basis of the deduced amino acid sequence of FNZ, the mature protein has a molecular mass of approximately 61 kDa. Analysis of FNZ reveals a structural organization similar to that of other cell surface proteins from streptococci and staphylococci. The Fn-binding activity is localized to two domains in the C-terminal part of FNZ. One domain is composed of five repeats, which contain a motif similar to what has earlier been found in other Fn-binding proteins in streptococci and staphylococci. The first and second repeats are separated by a short stretch of amino acids, including the motif LAGESGET, which is an important part of the second Fn-binding domain. This motif is also present in an Fn-binding domain (UR) in protein F of Streptococcus pyogenes. A fusion protein covering the Fn-binding domain of FNZ inhibits the binding of the 29-kDa N-terminal fragment of Fn to cells of various streptococcal species as well as to Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Bacterial complications of primary varicella in children.
AB  - Bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. Seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. The eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (P = .00025). Skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or shock occurred in 23 (27%). The latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (P = .011) and bacteremia (P = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (P = .001), prolonged hospitalization (P < .0001), intensive care management (P < .0001), and fatal outcome (P = .019). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. Before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (P = .09). These data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.
TI  - Management of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus and streptococcus are bacteria commonly found on the skin and in the mucous membrane. These bacteria are frequently associated with mild cutaneous infections but may invade to cause deeper infections including necrotizing soft-tissue infections, sepsis with or without metastatic lesions, and immunologic or toxin associated sequelae. Early recognition and timely intervention are the hallmarks of appropriate management. Initial empiric therapy should be directed towards a broad spectrum of pathogens that include staphylococcus and streptococcus.
TI  - [Erysipelas and impetigo].
AB  - Erysipela is a dermal or hypodermal infection of the skin, which predominantly involves the leg and is associated with high fever. Erysipela is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Venous insufficiency or lymphoedema are important local factors for the development of this infection which spreads from intertrigo, local wound or leg ulcer. Treatment is essentially based on parenteral penicillin G. Impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin due to Staphylococcus aureus or to Streptococcus pyogenes, and is frequent in children. Classical impetigo is made of yellow-brown crusts located around the mouth and nose, whereas bullous impetigo involves frequently the trunk and limbs. Secondary impetigo occurring in pediculosis or scabiosis is frequent. It is a contagious disease which is more frequent in patients with poor hygiene. It can be treated by general antibiotics, mainly macrolides, penicillin M or cephalosporins.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity and post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Recent macrolide derivatives, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin show more favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison to old ones and some differences in antibacterial activity. With the aim of improving our understanding of some aspects of their action against respiratory pathogens, we determined the MICs and MBCs of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin was the most active agent against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, while clarithromycin was more active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs similar to those of erythromycin. The bactericidal activity of all tested derivatives was weak against Staphylococcus aureus (MBC/MIC ratio approximately 16) and against Moraxella catarrhalis (MBC/MIC ratio, 8-16), but good against Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MBC/MIC ratio, 2-4). The determination of killing curves in the presence of 2 MIC and 10 MIC of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin confirmed their weak bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis as well as their effective activity against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Azithromycin showed the highest bactericidal activity against Haemophilus influenzae. As expected, the three derivatives produced a quite prolonged PAE when exposed to 5 MIC for 1 h, ranging between 2-4 h. The bactericidal activity and the prolonged PAE of new macrolides for the most common respiratory pathogens should assure a good clinical activity in respiratory infections including those sustained by Haemophilus influenzae, which is less susceptible to erythromycin and other old macrolides.
TI  - Excipient interaction with cetylpyridinium chloride activity in tablet based lozenges.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the investigation was to determine the effect of tablet excipients on the activity of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and the relative interaction between excipients and CPC. METHODS: An analytical assay was developed to evaluate the interaction between CPC and the excipients. In vivo activity was investigated using six volunteers by determining the reduction in colony forming units recoverable from the oropharynx after sucking each proprietary lozenge separately on different days. In vitro determinations investigated the relative antimicrobial activity of aqueous solutions of the lozenges and, the effect of pH and tablet base excipients on that activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the tablet based lozenges had markedly reduced antimicrobial activities compared with previous results with a candy based lozenge (in vivo and in vitro) or the same concentration of aqueous CPC (in vitro). Magnesium stearate suspensions in CPC 250 micrograms/ml indicated that magnesium stearate adsorbed CPC and at 0.4% lozenge weight and above significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of CPC 250 micrograms/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced activity of CPC in tablet based lozenges resulted from a decreased availability of CPC in solution due to an adsorption of CPC on magnesium stearate. To avoid this reduction in activity tablet based lozenges containing CPC 250 micrograms/ml, or similar concentrations, plus magnesium stearate should contain not more than 0.3% w/w lozenge weight of the lubricant.

TI  - Survival of potentially pathogenic human-associated bacteria in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat.
AB  - Plants may serve as reservoirs for human-associated bacteria (H-AB) in long-term  space missions containing bioregenerative life support systems. The current study examined the abilities of five human-associated potential pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli, to colonize and grow in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat, a candidate crop for life support. All of these bacteria have been recovered from past NASA missions and present potential problems for future missions. The abilities of these organisms to adhere to the roots of axenic five-day-old wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yecora rojo) were evaluated by enumeration of the attached organisms after a one hour incubation of roots in a suspension (approximately 10(8) cfu ml-1) of the H-AB. Results showed that a greater percentage of P. aeruginosa cells adhered to the wheat roots than the other four H-AB. Similarly incubated seedlings were also grown under attempted axenic conditions for seven days to examine the potential of each organism to proliferate in the rhizosphere (root colonization capacity). P. cepacia and P. aerogiunosa showed considerable growth, E. coli and S. aureus showed no significant growth, and S. pyogenes died off in the wheat rhizosphere. Studies examining the effects of competition on the survival of these microorganisms indicated that P. aeruginosa was the only organism that survived in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat in the presence of different levels of microbial competition.

TI  - An open comparative study of azithromycin and roxithromycin in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - An open, multicentre study was undertaken in order to evaluate the efficacies and safety profiles of azithromycin and roxithromycin in 440 adults with acute otitis media, sinusitis or acute beta-haemiolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis. Treatment with 500 mg azithromycin, administered orally once daily for 3 days, produced a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) in 51/52 (98%) patients with otitis media, 91/91 (100%) patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis and 64/68 (94%) patients with sinusitis. Treatment with 150 mg roxithromycin, given orally twice daily for 10 days, produced satisfactory clinical responses in 54/55 (98%), 91/92 (99%) and 69/73 (94%) patients with otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis and sinusitis respectively. Of the 17 azithromycin-treated patients with sinusitis who were clinically and bacteriologically evaluable, Staphylococcus aureus persisted in two and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one. S. aureus also persisted in 1/12 clinically and bacteriologically-evaluable patient treated with roxithromycin. Of the 58 and 64 patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis treated with azithromycin and roxithromycin, respectively, who were clinically and bacteriologically evaluable, Streptococcus pyogenes persisted at the end of treatment in 7/58 (12%) in the azithromycin group and in 13/64 (20%) in the roxithromycin group. At follow-up, there was no evidence of S. pyogenes reinfection in patients treated with azithromycin. Three episodes of reinfection occurred in the roxithromycin treatment group. Also, three patients showed evidence of clinical relapse at follow-up, although no pathogens were isolated. Azithromycin was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events. No azithromycin-treated patient was withdrawn prematurely because of a treatment-related event. Three roxithromycin-treated patients were withdrawn from treatment because of severe headache, thyroiditis or fatigue. In conclusion, for adults with acute upper respiratory tract infections, a 3-day course of once-daily azithromycin was found to be as effective and as well tolerated as a 10-day course of twice-daily roxithromycin.
TI  - Assembly of human contact phase proteins and release of bradykinin at the surface of curli-expressing Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previous work has demonstrated that most strains of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes bind kininogens through M protein, a fibrous surface protein and virulence determinant. Here we find that strains of several other pathogenic bacterial species, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, isolated from patients with sepsis, also bind kininogens, especially kininogen (HK). The most pronounced interaction was seen between HK and Escherichia coli. Among clinical isolates of E. coli, the majority of the enterohaemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, but none of the enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic strains, bound HK. Binding of HK to E. coli correlated with the expression of curli, another fibrous bacterial surface protein, and the binding of HK to purified curli was specific, saturable, and of high affinity; Ka = 9 x 10(7) M-1. Other contact phase proteins such as factor XI, factor XII, and prekallikrein bound to curliated E. coli, but not to an isogenic curli-deficient mutant strain, suggesting that contact phase activation may occur at the surface of curliated bacteria. Kininogens are also precursor molecules of the vasoactive kinins. When incubated with human plasma, curli-expressing bacteria absorbed HK. Addition of purified plasma kallikrein to the HK-loaded bacteria resulted in a rapid and efficient release of bradykinin from surface-bound HK. The assembly of contact phase factors at the surface of pathogenic bacteria and the release of the potent proinflammatory and vasoactive peptide bradykinin, should have a major impact on the host-microbe relationship and may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiology of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - Chronic sinusitis is one of the most common diseases treated in outpatient centres. In this prospective study, 49 patients with the diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated microbiologically by using sinus swab, irrigation fluid and sinus mucosal tissue specimens obtained during endoscopic sinus surgery. There was no bacterial growth in seven cases. In the remaining 42 cases a total of 89 bacteria were isolated, 28 of them being classical pathogens and 61 being non-classical pathogens. Among the classical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus was the most common one. The correlation between the isolates obtained from maxillary sinus and isolates obtained from throat, nose and nasopharynx did not have a predictive value. Since the overall rate of classical pathogen isolation from patients with chronic sinusitis was not significantly high, the possible role of factors other than bacterial growth should be identified in the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis.

TI  - Enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with Actinobacillus suis.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed Actinobacillus suis ATCC 15,557 (AS 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by AS 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed Lavtobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC 9018) and penicillin-treated Streptococcus pyogenes, Su (OK-432). In immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) against P. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of AS 15,557. The degree of PEC augmentation induced by AS 15,557 was higher than that induced by LC 9018 or by OK-432. The toxicity and histopathological changes associated with AS 15557 were very low, as compared with those by produced by LC 9018 and OK-432. The results suggest that AS 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of clarithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of clarithromycin (CAM), a new  oral macrolide antibiotic, were compared with those of erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM) and rokitamycin (RKM). The antibacterial spectrum and in vitro activities of CAM were similar to those of EM. Therapeutic efficacies of CAM against various experimental infections in mice--including systemic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and subcutaneous abscess due to S. aureus, and bacterial pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae--were superior to those of EM, JM and RKM. CAM exhibited higher serum levels than EM in mice after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. The in vitro activity of CS-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. In particular, CS-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. The activity of CS-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. CS-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa, CS-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. Against experimental pneumonia with K. pneumoniae in mice, CS-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. These results suggest that CS-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis complicating pregnancy and puerperium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon, rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection involving the subcutaneous tissue and fascia. Usually, it is a synergistic polymicrobic infection that occurs in patients with coexisting factors predisposing them to bacterial inoculation and the spread of infection. CASES: We report a monomicrobial variant of necrotizing fasciitis affecting three otherwise healthy pregnant or postpartum women. The necrotizing fasciitis involved either the lower extremity or the abdominal wall. The causative bacteria were Streptococcus pyogenes (two cases) and Staphylococcus aureus (one). All patients presented with an acute fulminant infection, including one woman who died from overwhelming sepsis. CONCLUSION: These cases raise a question about the possible role of increased bacterial virulence and the immunologic changes of pregnancy as potential predisposing factors in the development of necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Importance of Staphylococcus hyicus ssp hyicus as a cause of arthritis in pigs up to 12 weeks of age.
AB  - Lame pigs, up to 12 weeks of age, were necropsied to establish a diagnosis. Of 175 pigs examined, 165 were confirmed to have arthritis by histopathological examination of joint tissues. Lesions were most common in the elbow and tarsal joints and least common in the joints of the feet. Typically, there was severe fibrinopurulent inflammation of synovial membranes regardless of the bacteria isolated. A bacterial aetiology was found in 114 (69%) of the 165 pigs. In arthritic pigs in which an aetiology was established the causative agents were Staphylococcus hyicus ssp hyicus (24.6%), Streptococcus equisimilis (26.3%), Actinomyces pyogenes (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and Haemophilus parasuis (7.9%). While gender did not affect the prevalence of arthritis, there was an age influence, most of the pigs culled for arthritis being under 6 weeks of age.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [Efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil in the treatment of acute otitis media due to benzylpenicillin-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  - Clinical and bacteriological studies were carried out on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI) granule in infantile purulent acute otitis media treated at general practice settings and the following findings were obtained: 1. Two hundred forty eight strains were isolated from 210 patients, almost all of which (81.1%) harbored the following two strains: Streptococcus pneumoniae (42.3%) and Haemophilus influenzae (38.8%). Among S. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae, (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 36.2%, corresponding to 15.3% of all the isolates and found in 18% of all patients. 2. The bacteria in the middle ear discharge and the nasopharyngeal swabs were correlated with conformity rate of more than 80% with regard to Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae but no Staphylococcus aureus was detected simultaneously from the two sources in any of the patients. S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were considered to be contaminants that were originated from the external auditory meatus at the time of sampling. 3. Frequencies of isolation of S. pneumoniae from different age groups were higher in a lower age group between 0 and 4 years and those of PISP or PRSP had the similar tendency. 4. Antibacterial activities were determined for CDTR and related oral antibiotics against the strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae as representative isolates. CDTR had stronger antibacterial activities against both bacteria than the reference antibiotics. CDTR was found to be transferred into the otorrhea at a mean concentration of 0.58 micrograms/ml after single administration of CDTR-PI granule formulation at 3 mg(potency)/kg. 5. As for bacterial eradication efficacies in the middle ear cavity and the nasopharynx, eradication rates were higher than 80% in the middle ear cavity in all cases without large differences among bacterial species but eradication rate of PISP was 30% in the nasopharynx, and it was significantly lower than those of PSSP and other bacteria. 6. In view of clinical effectiveness, the efficacy rate was 89.4% and bacteriological effects was 92.2%; in view of safety, adverse reactions were; observed in 9.5% and the rate of usefulness was 89.4%. 7. From above-stated results, CDTR-PI was considered as a useful oral antibiotic for infantile acute otitis media including PISP infections.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Bacterial superantigen-induced human lymphocyte responses are nitric oxide dependent and mediated by IL-12 and IFN-gamma.
AB  - Bacterial superantigens cause marked proliferation of T cells and release of lymphokines. Nitric oxide, derived from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, inhibits this activation in murine cells. We have now investigated the roles of IL-12, IFN-gamma, lymphotoxin-alpha, and nitric oxide during superantigen-induced human lymphocyte activation. Lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of proliferative responses and lymphokine release. Both toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 from Staphylococcus aureus and recombinant streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A induced proliferation and production of IFN-gamma, lymphotoxin-alpha, and IL-12 by human mononuclear cells in a time-dependent fashion. The release of IFN-gamma was abrogated by a neutralizing Ab to IL-12, but lymphocyte proliferative responses were unaffected. A neutralizing Ab to IFN-gamma prevented the release of lymphotoxin-alpha, but did not affect proliferation. The neutralization of lymphotoxin-alpha using two different Abs did not affect IFN-gamma release or proliferation. In contrast to previous findings in mice, the arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, significantly inhibited both proliferation and lymphokine release by superantigen-stimulated human cells. Thus, the release of lymphotoxin-alpha by lymphocytes following superantigen stimulation is dependent upon the presence of IFN-gamma; the IFN-gamma response is in turn under the control of IL-12. There is no evidence that nitric oxide plays an inhibitory role during superantigen-mediated human lymphocyte activation. Indeed, arginine is a prerequisite for such activation.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Glycerol and ichthammol: medicinal solution or mythical potion?
AB  - Glycerol and ichthammol (G & I) has been used for generations by otologists. However, there is a paucity of information on both its mode of action and its anti-bacterial properties. The aim of this paper was to ascertain firstly, what the most common organisms found in discharging ears were and secondly, what antibacterial activity G & I had against these organisms. All ear swabs from 1992-1994 in our unit were reviewed to ascertain the prevalence of the commonly isolated organisms. Fresh isolates of these organisms were collected and plated onto agar with wells of glycerol, ichthammol and a combination of both as used in clinical practice. The diameters of the zones of inhibition observed after incubation were measured in millimetres. Common isolates were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabalis, Streptococcus pyogenes in descending order of frequency. Pure glycerol showed no significant zones of inhibition against any of the organisms tested. The average zones of inhibition for G & I and ichthammol alone were for Staphylococcus aureus 15 mm and 18 mm and for Streptococcus pyogenes: 16 mm and 23 mm. Ichthammol alone was significantly more effective than G & I (p < 0.001). There was no significant activity against Proteus mirabalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic benefit of G & I is due in part to the inherent anti-bacterial activity of ichthammol against the Gram positive organisms as well as its anti-inflammatory action and the dehydrating effect of the glycerol.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - The effect of formulation on the antimicrobial activity of cetylpyridinium chloride in candy based lozenges.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence on the  antimicrobial activity of cetylpyridinium chloride of the various components of the formulation of each of six candy based lozenges. METHODS: In vivo activity was investigated using six volunteers by determining the reduction in colony forming units recoverable from the oropharynx after sucking each lozenge separately on different days. In vitro determinations investigated the relative activity of aqueous solutions of the lozenges, the effect on activity of additional active ingredients, pH and lozenge base ingredients against separate inocula of each of the test organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the pH of the dissolved lozenge solution was the single most influential readily adjustable formulation parameter which significantly influenced the activity of cetylpyridinium chloride activity in candy based lozenges. CONCLUSIONS: Lozenges containing cetylpyridinium chloride as the active ingredient should be formulated at a pH greater than 5.5.
TI  - Phylogenetic distribution of streptococcal superantigen SSA allelic variants provides evidence for horizontal transfer of ssa within Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Phylogenetic analyses recently found the gene encoding the streptococcal superantigen SSA of Streptococcus pyogenes to occur in several well-differentiated clones comprising 10 (12.5%) of 80 clonal lineages examined. To determine if distinct clonal lineages carried the same ssa coding sequence or harbored a group of allelic variants, ssa was sequenced from 23 S. pyogenes strains representing the 10 clones identified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Three alleles of ssa were found in natural populations of S. pyogenes. ssa-1 and ssa-3 differed by a single synonymous substitution in codon 94; both encoded SSA-1. Each of these alleles was present in phylogenetically diverse clones that had not shared a recent common ancestor. ssa-2 was present in a single clonal lineage. It was identical to ssa-3 at codon 94 but had a nonsynonymous substitution at codon 28 that changed the second amino acid of the mature protein from serine to arginine. This substitution altered the predicted isoelectric point and affected the apparent molecular mass during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Despite sequence variation both upstream of and within the ssa locus, all ssa-positive lineages expressed either SSA-1 or SSA-2. The observed patterns of ssa allele-clone distribution provide evidence for individual incidences of horizontal transfer and recombination of ssa among distinct group A streptococcal lineages. Although the extensive homology of SSA to the staphylococcal superantigen SEB raises the possibility of intergeneric gene transfer, a search for ssa in 68 genetically diverse clones of Staphylococcus aureus did not identify the gene. Moreover, the absence of ssa among 119 representative strains of Lancefield group B, C, or G streptococci suggests that ssa is confined to S. pyogenes.
TI  - Production in Escherichia of moricin, a novel type antibacterial peptide from the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
AB  - Moricin is a novel type antibacterial peptide recently isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Two foreign gene expression systems in Escherichia coli were employed to obtain a large amount of the peptide for further characterization. An artificial moricin gene was chemically synthesized and inserted into two expression vectors, pXa1 and pMAL-c2. The recombinant moricin was efficiently produced in E. coli as fusion proteins and released by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide or o-iodosobenzoic acid. Eleven milligrams of pure recombinant moricin was obtained from 2 L of E. coli culture. The primary structure and molecular mass of the purified recombinant moricin was the same as those of the natural moricin. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the recombinant moricin against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of the natural moricin.
TI  - T-cell epitope analysis using subtracted expression libraries (TEASEL): application to a 38-kDA autoantigen recognized by T cells from an insulin-dependent diabetic patient.
AB  - Studies on circulating T cells and antibodies in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic  patients and rodent models of autoimmune diabetes suggest that beta-cell membrane proteins of 38 kDa may be important molecular targets of autoimmune attack. Biochemical approaches to the isolation and identification of the 38-kDa autoantigen have been hampered by the restricted availability of islet tissue and the low abundance of the protein. A procedure of epitope analysis for CD4+ T cells using subtracted expression libraries (TEASEL) was developed and used to clone a 70-amino acid pancreatic beta-cell peptide incorporating an epitope recognized by a 38-kDa-reactive CD4+ T-cell clone (1C6) isolated from a human diabetic patient. The minimal epitope was mapped to a 10-amino acid synthetic peptide containing a DR1 consensus binding motif. Data base searches did not reveal the identity of the protein, though a weak homology to the bacterial superantigens SEA (Streptococcus pyogenes exotoxin A) and SEB (Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B) (23% identity) was evident. The TEASEL procedure might be used to identify epitopes of other autoantigens recognized by CD4+ T cells in diabetes as well as be more generally applicable to the study low-abundance autoantigens in other tissue-specific autoimmune diseases.
TI  - Cefpodoxime proxetil suspension compared with cefaclor suspension for treatment of acute otitis media in paediatric patients.
AB  - A multicentre open-label, randomised trial was performed to compare the efficacy  and safety of cefpodoxime proxetil bd and cefaclor tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. A total of 167 children aged from 1 month to 11 years were enrolled in five centres: 78 treated with cefpodoxime and 83 treated with cefaclor, were evaluated in the ITT analysis. After tympanocentesis and culture of middle ear fluid, a pathogen was isolated from 85 (53%) of the 161 evaluable patients for the ITT analysis. The organisms isolated were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae: (n = 33, 37.5%); Haemophilus influenzae: (n = 22, 25%); Staphylococcus aureus: (n = 15, 17.1%); Streptococcus pyogenes: (n = 8, 9.1%); Moraxella catarrhalis: (n = 2, 2.3%); others (n = 6, 6.8%). Success (defined as a satisfactory clinical outcome, either cure or improvement) was achieved at the end of treatment, in 93.6% of ther patients in the cefpodoxime group and 91.6% of the patients in the cefaclor group (P> 0.05). Clinical recurrence was identified at the follow-up visit (30 days after inclusion), in 6.4% of the cefpodoxime-treated patients and 7.2% of the cefaclor-treated patients (P> 0.05). The drugs were well tolerated by 78/79 (99%) of patients in the cefpodoxime-treated group and 80/85 (94%) in the cefaclor-treated group. The incidence of adverse effects was higher in the cefaclor group than in the cefpodoxime group, but this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). IN conclusion, cefpodaxime proxetil administered bd is as effective as cefaclor administered tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. The less frequent dosing schedule of cefpodoxime (bd) compared with cefaclor (tds) appears to be more convenient for the treatment of the infections in children.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Bactericidal activity, morphological alterations, and synergistic interactions of rufloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with its N-desmethylate D derivative (MF 922).
AB  - The in vitro activity of rufloxacin, alone and in combination with its metabolite (MF 922) against common respiratory and urinary tract pathogens and anaerobes was assessed. No synergistic interaction between rufloxacin and MF 922 was observed by the checkerboard technique against aerobic bacteria. When the time-kill system was employed, 24 synergistic interactions were noted out of 30 tests performed (80%), of which 14 (100%) were with Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 2 with Moraxella catarrhalis (50%), 4 with Haemophilus influenzae (100%), 2 with Staphylococcus aureus (50%) and 2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (50%). Synergism was found with all Bacteroides fragilis irrespectively of the method used. Rufloxacin alone or in combination with MF 922, at concentrations achieved in vivo, induced morphological alterations in all the pathogens analyzed with the exception of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Towards S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, the same levels of rufloxacin and MF 922 were capable of inducing only bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effect, followed by reversible morphological modifications. The presence of 50% human serum in the test media did not affect the results.
TI  - Reactivity of mouse T-cell hybridomas expressing human Vbeta gene segments with staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens.
AB  - A panel of 15 mouse T-cell hybridomas, each expressing a different human Vbeta gene segment (hVbeta) in an otherwise mouse T-cell receptor (i.e., mouse alpha chain and CD3 complex), was constructed by transfection of hVbeta/mouse Cbeta chimeric T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta genes into a mouse T-cell hybridoma recipient lacking the endogenous TCR-beta chain. Several qualities that are conferred by the hVbeta chain of the TCR are retained in the chimeric human-mouse TCR complex: a large panel of hVbeta-specific antibodies specifically stained the hVbeta expressed by the mouse T-cell hybridomas. Moreover, hVbeta-transfected mouse cells could readily produce interleukin 2 when stimulated by superantigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. These characteristics made it possible to refine the reactivity of 17 superantigen preparations with the available transfected Vbetas. Each superantigen gave a characteristic pattern of reactivity on the transfectants. Positive reactivities with some of these transfectants, which differ only by the expressed hVbeta, demonstrate unambiguously the superantigenic character of a protein or fraction and its potential to react with the corresponding Vbetas. Therefore, these hVbeta-transfected cells constituted a valuable tool for determining "specificity fingerprints" of known or putative superantigens. First, commonly used, commercially available superantigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) showed additional Vbeta reactivities, compared with those of their recombinant counterparts. This stresses the importance of using defined preparations of superantigens for the definition of Vbeta specificities. Second, the stimulatory pattern of a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes demonstrated that this strain, unlike others, produces a potent Vbeta 8-specific superantigen that is an yet undefined at the molecular level.
TI  - Food safety: review and implications for dietitians and dietetic technicians.
AB  - Section 103 (d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act directs the secretary of health and human services to identify, publish, and annually review a list of pathogens transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers. The secretary is also directed to publish means by which diseases on the list are transmitted. The intent of the list is to protect disabled food handlers when they become ill and to provide managers with information for determining when to remove or reassign disabled food handlers who have infectious or communicable diseases to jobs that do not involve handling food. Pathogens often transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers are Salmonella typhi, Shigella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, hepatitis A virus, and the Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses. This article discusses section 103 (d) and for each of the six pathogens describes characteristics and growth requirements, types of foods involved in outbreaks, factors that contribute to foodborne outbreaks, and prevention and control measures. Human beings are the only reservoir of Sal typhi. The source of Shigella species is the intestinal tract of human beings and other primates. Human beings are the common reservoir of Staph aureus and Strep pyogenes. Staph aureus is frequently found in the nose and on the skin of healthy people, whereas Strep pyogenes is carried in the throat of infected or asymptomatic carriers. Foodborne viruses of public health concern originate in the human intestine. Foods that favor the multiplication of Sal typhi are often foods that require no cooking. Many outbreaks of foodborne disease attributed to Shigella species and viruses have been associated with salads. Moist, high-protein, and salty foods that have been cooked are most often involved in outbreaks of staphylococcal foodborne illness. Foods usually implicated in Strep pyogenes outbreaks are predominately composed of milk, eggs, or meat. Dietitians and dietetic technicians can use three approaches to reduce the incidence of foodborne disease attributed to food handlers: conducting training and education programs, implementing a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system, and supporting certification of foodservice managers.
TI  - Conformational changes in the fibronectin binding MSCRAMMs are induced by ligand  binding.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to host tissue involves specific microbial surface adhesins of which a subfamily termed microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) specifically recognize extracellular matrix components. We now report on the biophysical characterization of recombinant fibronectin binding MSCRAMMs originating from several different species of Gram-positive bacteria. The far-UV CD spectra (190-250 nm) of recombinant forms of the ligand binding domain of the MSCRAMMs, in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at neutral pH, were characteristic of a protein containing little or no regular secondary structure. The intrinsic viscosity of this domain was found to be the same in the presence or absence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, indicating that the native and denatured conformations are indistinguishable. On addition of fibronectin NH2 terminus as ligand to the recombinant adhesin there is a large change in the resulting far-UV CD difference spectra. At a 4.9 M excess of the NH2 terminus the difference spectra shifted to what was predominately a beta-sheet conformation, as judged by comparison with model far-UV CD spectra. The fibronectin NH2-terminal domain undergoes a minute but reproducible blue-shift of its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on addition of rFNBD-A, which contains no tryptophan residues. Since this result indicates that there is no large change in the environment of the tryptophan residues of the NH2 terminus on binding, the large shift in secondary structure observed by CD analysis is attributed to induction of a predominately beta-sheet secondary structure in the adhesin on binding to fibronectin NH2 terminus.
TI  - A monoclonal antibody enhances ligand binding of fibronectin MSCRAMM (adhesin) from Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody 3A10, generated from a mouse immunized with the Streptococcus dysgalactiae fibronectin (Fn) binding protein FnbA, was isolated, and its effect on ligand binding by the antigen was examined. The epitope for 3A10 was localized to a previously unidentified Fn binding motif (designated An) just N-terminal of the repeat domain which represents the primary ligand binding site on FnbA. Fn binding to Au was enhanced by 3A10 rather than inhibited. This effect was demonstrated in two different assays. First, in the presence of 3A10 the Au-containing proteins and synthetic peptide more effectively competed with bacterial cells for binding to Fn. Second, 3A10 dramatically increased the binding of biotin-labeled forms of the Au-containing proteins to Fn immobilized on a blotting membrane. Pure 3A10 IgG did not recognize the antigen by itself, and Fn was required for the immunological interaction between the antibody and the epitope. This induction effect of Fn was shown in both Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which immobilized Au-containing molecules were probed with 3A10 in the presence of varying concentrations of Fn. Specificity analyses of 3A10 revealed that the monoclonal also recognized a ligand binding motif in a Streptococcus pyogenes Fn binding MSCRAMM but not the corresponding motifs in two related adhesins from Staphylococcus aureus and S. dysgalactiae. Furthermore, 3A10 stimulated Fn binding by S. pyogenes cells. These results together with subsequent biophysical studies presented in the accompanying paper (House-Pomepeo, K., Xu, Y., Joh, D., Speziale, P., and Hook, M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1379-1384) indicate that the ligand binding sites of Fn binding MSCRAMMs have little or no secondary structure. However, on binding to Fn, they appear to undergo a structural rearrangement resulting in a defined structure rich in beta sheet and expressing a ligand-induced binding site for antibodies such as 3A10.
TI  - Systemic immune response to Streptococcal and Staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids in children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - The antibodies to LTA of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in sera from 110 children with or without recurrent tonsillitis were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody of IgA class was not detected in any sera. There was a significant positive correlation between IgG and IgM antibody levels to LTA of S. pyogenes and those to LTA of S. aureus. There was no significant correlation between anti-LTA IgM antibody and age or episodes of tonsillitis. However, serum anti-LTA IgG levels in younger patients ( < or = 7 y.o.) were significantly lower than those in their elders (>7 y.o.) (anti-S. pyogenes; p = 0.0007, anti-S. aureus; p = 0.007). Serum anti-LTA IgG antibody levels correlated inversely with episodes of tonsillitis in younger patients ( < 7 y.o.) (S. pyogenes: r = -0.362, p = 0.0082, S. aureus: r = -0.276, p = 0.047). These findings suggest that systemic hyposensitivity to LTA of S. pyogenes and S. aureus may be a possible cause of habitualness of tonsillitis in young children.
TI  - [On adenoidectomy].
AB  - The paper deals on the advantages for the rhinopharynx following adenoidectomy. The AA. explain their procedure for its removal under visual control. Both a radiological and microbiological study was done in 90 children waiting for the removal with the aim of realizing the changes derived to the upper air-way. The surgery enhances the adenoidal expression and significatively improves the rhinopharyngeal air-way (p < 0.001). Furthermore the pathogenic flora of epipharynx changes for benefit of the saprophytic flora (p < 0.001). The adenoidectomy is indicated when the adenoidal mass hinder the nasopharyngeal breathing, when causes adenoid outbreaks and also in those cases of stubborn secretory otitis not yielding to conservative treatment.
TI  - Molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  - Research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. Population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. A common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. Many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. Because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. Continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.
TI  - The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in children with otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of nasopharyngeal alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, as a defense mechanism of the normal bacterial flora against infection. Cultures were taken from the nasopharynges of 43 children with otitis media with effusion (OME). The detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococus aureus and group A streptococci were significantly lower in the nasopharynx than those isolated from the tonsils of the same patients. Moreover, the detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against all of these pathogens derived from the nasopharynx were lower than those in healthy children, streptococcal strains with activity against H. influenzae and Strep, pneumoniae were also lower than that in patients with tonsillitis. These findings suggest that low nasopharyngeal levels of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against respiratory pathogens may render children susceptible to OME. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the prevalence of pathogens in the nasopharynx and the inhibitory activities of alpha-streptococci against them in order to devise and select optimal treatment for patients with OME.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Emerging resistance to antimicrobial agents in gram-positive bacteria. Enterococci, staphylococci and nonpneumococcal streptococci.
AB  - Staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species) and enterococci are the aetiological organisms in 47 to 52% of nosocomial blood stream infections and approximately 30% of all nosocomial infections in the US. In European intensive care units, almost half of all infections are attributed to staphylococci. The streptococci have also become increasingly important because of the modified virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and the emerging role of the viridans group streptococci as a cause of potentially fatal bacteraemia in the neutropenic host. Resistance to available antimicrobial agents is increasing and includes, in particular, resistance to the glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) amongst enterococci, resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) amongst staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin and some other beta-lactams amongst viridans group streptococci. New compounds for effective therapy of infection with antimicrobial-resistant Gram-positive species are needed urgently. To this end, the streptogramin combinations [quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid)], everninomycin derivatives (SCH 27899), oxazolidinones (U-100572, U-100766) and several newer fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, DU 6859a, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin) are under rapid development and clinical investigation.
TI  - Etiology of acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections that are implicated as significant contributors to morbidity in HIV-infected children. To establish the optimal antibiotic therapy tympanocentesis is indicated as the first line diagnostic procedure, because unusual pathogens may play a role in advanced stages of deficient humoral or cellular immunity. METHODS: The microbiology of 60 episodes of AOM diagnosed in 21 symptomatic HIV-infected children (ages 9 months to 12 years) was compared with that of 121 episodes of AOM occurring in 113 immunocompetent HIV-negative children (ages 6 months to 12 years) in the last 5 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of the three most common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) was similar in HIV-infected and in normal children (56.5% vs. 54.9% of the ears). Staphylococcus aureus was significantly more frequent in AOM diagnosed in severely immunosuppressed stages. A significantly lower proportion of middle ear effusions obtained in HIV-infected children yielded no bacteria compared with normal children. Beta-lactamase production among isolates of H. influenzae was a rare phenomenon, both in HIV-infected and in normal children. No penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was found. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected children with absent or moderate immunosuppression empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the recommendations given for immunocompetent children of the same geographic area. In severe immunosuppressed stages, given the possible role of Staph. aureus, extended spectrum antibiotics should be considered.
TI  - Antibacterial and immunostimulating casein-derived substances from milk: casecidin, isracidin peptides.
AB  - Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified with casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of alpha s1-casein. This product consisted of the N -terminal segment (1-23) of alpha s1-casein B, named "isracidin", and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on a large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.
TI  - Interactions of human mannose-binding protein with lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - We explored the interaction of human recombinant mannose-binding protein and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The best ligand was Micrococcus luteus lipomannan, followed by Enterococcus spp. LTA containing mono-, di-, and oligoglucosyl substituents. LTAs lacking terminal sugars (those of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) or containing galactosyl substituents (those of Listeria spp. and Lactococcus spp.) were poor ligands. These results are consistent with known structural requirements for binding through the mannose-binding protein carbohydrate recognition domain.
TI  - Recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Important new diseases due to bacterial toxins functioning as superantigens have been described with increasing frequency within recent years. Toxic shock syndrome, recalcitrant erythematous desquamating disorder, streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome, and, most recently, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki disease) have been etiologically linked with certain staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins. We describe two patients with a novel clinical presentation of toxin-mediated disease, which shares certain clinical features with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. OBSERVATIONS: Two otherwise healthy young male adults developed recurrent erysipelaslike perineal erythema, which regularly erupted within 1 to 2 days of the onset of acute pharyngitis. Accompanying signs included mucosal changes and acral erythema with desquamation. Throat cultures obtained during the acute episodes yielded toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus from one patient and toxin-producing Streptococcus pyogenes from the other. CONCLUSION: The recurrent nature, age predilection, and clinical presentation suggest that our patients display a unique clinical syndrome due to toxin-producing bacteria.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - Anti-microbial activity and anti-complement activity of extracts obtained from selected Hawaiian medicinal plants.
AB  - Selected plants having a history of use in Polynesian traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious disease were investigated for anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity in vitro. Extracts from Scaevola sericea, Psychotria hawaiiensis, Pipturus albidus and Eugenia malaccensis showed selective anti-viral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and 2 and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus. Aleurites moluccana extracts showed anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while Pipturus albidus and Eugenia malaccensis extracts showed growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Psychotria hawaiiensis and Solanum niger inhibited growth of the fungi Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum, while Ipomoea sp., Pipturus albidus, Scaevola sericea, Eugenia malaccensis, Piper methysticum, Barringtonia asiatica and Adansonia digitata extracts showed anti-fungal activity to a lesser extent. Eugenia malaccensis was also found to inhibit the classical pathway of complement suggesting that an immunological basis for its in vivo activity was identified. This study has confirmed some of the ethnobotanical reports of Hawaiian medicinal plants having curative properties against infections using biological assays in vitro.
TI  - Severity of varicella infection in Saudis with diabetes mellitus: a possible role of acyclovir in treatment.
AB  - Severity of varicella infection in 54 patients with diabetes mellitus seen in Arar Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia, between January 1992 and December 1994 was compared with that in 55 apparently healthy controls, seen during the same period. Persistent fever, defined as fever lasting more than five days; extensive skin eruption, defined as affecting more than 50% of the body surface; and secondary bacterial skin infection evidenced by a positive skin culture of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes occurred significantly more in diabetics than in healthy controls. The mean duration of the illness in diabetics was 16.8 +/- 3.24 days as compared to 13.6 +/- 3.32 days in healthy controls. These findings suggest that varicella runs a more aggressive course in diabetic patients compared to otherwise healthy individuals. Treatment with the anti-viral agent, acyclovir may be indicated in diabetics with varicella infection.
TI  - The potential role of bacterial superantigens in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki syndrome.
AB  - Kawasaki syndrome is an acute multisystem vasculitis of infancy and early childhood associated with high fever, mucocutaneous inflammation, and the development of coronary artery abnormalities. Despite the widely held belief that Kawasaki syndrome is an infectious disease, investigations have failed to identify a causal organism. Previous studies have demonstrated that this illness is associated with marked activation of monocyte/macrophages and the selective expansion of V beta 2-, less so, of V beta 8.1/8.2-expressing T cells in the peripheral blood from Kawasaki syndrome patients during the acute phase of their illness. These immunologic features are characteristic of diseases that are caused by bacterial toxins which act as superantigens. Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal exotoxins are prototypic superantigens which stimulate large populations of T cells expressing particular T-cell receptor beta-chain variable (V beta) gene segments. Using the V beta 2+ T-cell expansion as an "immunologic footprint" for a superantigen, we have extended these observations to the identification and isolation of a novel clone of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-producing Staphylococcus aureus in the majority of patients with Kawasaki syndrome and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B/streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C-producing streptococci in a minority of Kawasaki syndrome patients. Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C are known to stimulate V beta 2+ T cells. These observations support the hypothesis that the activation of V beta 2+ T cells during the acute phase of Kawasaki syndrome is caused by bacterial superantigen(s).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. S-1090 was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. The in vivo efficacy of S-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.
TI  - Assays to detect and characterize synthetic agents that inhibit the ErmC methyltransferase.
AB  - High throughput chemical file screening with an enzymatic assay to detect inhibitors of the ErmC methyltransferase enzyme from macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistant pathogenic bacteria identified low molecular weight compounds that had IC50S (50% inhibitory concentration) in the nMolar to microMolar range. These same inhibitors were assessed in vitro for their capacity to inhibit the liver enzyme, cathechol-O-methyltransferase and the prokaryotic enzyme, EcoRI methylase. Selective inhibitors of the ErmC methyltransferase were tested in tertiary assays to determine their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), as single agents and in combination with the macrolide, azithromycin, against strains of pathogenic bacteria expressing MLSB-resistance. Compounds that were active in vitro, alone or in combination with azithromycin, against strains of macrolide-resistant pathogens were tested in a mouse model of infection using an MLSB-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus or a macrolide-susceptible strain of Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Antibiotics and bacterial resistance. A few elements of genetic basis for this relationship.
AB  - In the preantibiotic era, many people died of bacterial infections caused by such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antibiotics have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases but not the prevalence of these diseases. It was not long after the clinical introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1950s that the first reports of bacterial resistance began to appear. Use, and often abuse or misuse, of antimicrobial agents has encouraged the evolution of bacteria toward resistance, resulting often in therapeutic failure. In the beginning, new antibiotics have always appeared in plenty of time to provide new cures for diseases caused by resistant bacterial pathogens. Also, some clinically important groups of bacteria showed no signs of major increases in resistance. For example, S. pneumoniae strains remained susceptible to penicillin long after other bacteria had become resistant to it. Recent developments of bacteria resistance to antibiotics are indeed disquieting.
TI  - Tumor necrosis factor production by human T-cells stimulated with bacterial superantigens.
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production from T-cells stimulated with superantigenic exotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A was investigated in the presence of cells bearing distinct isotypes of HLA class II molecules. The main T-cell subset for TNF production was investigated in parallel. Similarly high levels of TNF production were induced upon stimulation with the toxins in the presence of DR+ or DQ+ cells, but only marginal levels of TNF production were induced in the presence of DP+ cells. Although both CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells produced TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in response to toxin stimulation in the presence of HLA class II+ cells, the former T-cell subset was the major source of producers of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta.
TI  - Could nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) enhance the progression of bacterial infections to toxic shock syndrome?
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest an association between the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the progression of invasive group A streptococcal infections to shock and multiorgan failure. There is a biochemical rationale that could support this theory. Though NSAIDs are frequently used to relieve pain or reduce fever, they also attenuate granulocyte functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing. In addition, findings in recent studies involving human volunteers injected with endotoxin suggest that pretreatment with NSAIDs enhances production of tumor necrosis factor, which leads to higher blood levels of this cytokine, probably by preventing feedback inhibition by prostaglandin E2. Thus, NSAIDs may contribute to the sudden onset of shock, organ failure, and aggressive infection by inhibiting neutrophil function, augmenting cytokine production, and attenuating the cardinal manifestations of inflammation.
TI  - Bacterial causes of acute osteomyelitis in sickle cell anaemia: changing infection profile.
AB  - The bacterial causes of osteomyelitis were reviewed on 25 patients with sickle cell anaemia using blood culture and direct wound swab. Age range was 2 to 45 years with a median of 23 years. Klebsiella species were cultured in 45% of the blood samples. Staphylococcus aureus was responsible in 20%, Salmonella species in 8% and Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in 4% of the samples. From direct wound swab culture, Klebsiella was responsible for 36%, Staphylococcus aureus 28% and coagulase Negative Staphylococcus 24%. Proteus species were responsible for 8% and Salmonella was cultured in 4%. The highest number of patients presenting with osteomyelitis occurred in the second decade. From (culture) sensitivity tests, ceftazidine and Ofloxacine were found to be the most effective antibacterial drugs. The preponderance of Klebsiella indicates a change in the previously accepted pattern of infection in which Salmonella species were considered to be the main causative organism.
TI  - Open clinical trial of roxithromycin in patients of Plateau Hospitals, Jos in upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - An open clinical study to assess the efficacy and tolerance of Roxithromycin 150  mg twice daily was carried out amongst Nigerian patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections at Plateau Hospital Jos. Twenty-two patients aged between 13 and 86 years comprising of twelve women, seven men and three children completed the study. 18 (81.8%) had bronchopulmonary infections, 3 (13.6%) had tonsillitis and 1 (4.6%) had otitis media. Pathogens isolated included streptococcus Pneumonia (22.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (13.6%), Bramhella Catarrhalis (9.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (4.6%), Klebsiella species (4.6%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (4.6%). There was 88.2% bacteriological cure and patients responded fast, with no major adverse reactions. Roxithromycin is therefore concluded to be an effective well tolerated drug for treatment of respiratory tract infections in Nigerians.
TI  - In vivo therapeutic efficacies of PD 138312 and PD 140248, two novel fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are novel broad-spectrum 7-pyrrolidinyl fluoronaphthyridines with a cyclopropyl or a difluorophenyl substitution at the 1 positions, respectively. They have been demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms. These compounds were evaluated for their in vivo potencies against acute systemic infections in mice and in a mouse pneumococcal pneumonia model. They were very effective by both the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration. Most remarkable were their comparative median protective values against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In general, these compounds were 28- to 100-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these clinically significant organisms when the drugs were given orally and 10- to 38-fold more active when the drugs were given parenterally. Average ratios of drug concentrations in mice after drug administration by the oral route to that after administration by the subcutaneous route indicate 34 to 44% greater bioavailabilities of PD 138312 and PD 140248 compared with that of ciprofloxacin. In a multidose pneumococcal mouse pneumonia model these new quinolones were extremely effective, with median curative doses of 2 to 2.8 mg/kg of body weight per dose. Ciprofloxacin was ineffective (median curative dose, >100 mg/kg per dose) in this model. Comparative pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed a relative superiority of PD 140248. Peak levels of PD 140248 in blood after the administration of a single oral 50-mg/kg dose were twice those of PD 138312 and ciprofloxacin, with PD 140248 having a substantially longer half-life. These results indicate that PD 138312 and PD 140248 have excellent therapeutic potential against clinically important gram-positive pathogens when the drugs are administered both orally and parenterally.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of three acid-stable azalide compounds, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.
AB  - L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 are novel azalide derivatives of erythromycin  that exhibit improved acid stability over erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. The half-life in aqueous solution at pH = 2.1 of these compounds ranged from 0.3 hour for erythromycin to 16.2 hours for L-708,299. The rank order of half-life in acid solution from most to least stable was L-708,299 > L-701,677 > L-708,365 > azithromycin = clarithromycin > erythromycin. In a disseminated Streptococcus pyogenes mouse infection model, azithromycin and L-708,365 were slightly more efficacious than clarithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299; all 5 compounds being more active than erythromycin. In a Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary challenge mouse model, azithromycin, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 were all equal in efficacy and at least four-fold more active than clarithromycin and erythromycin. Clarithromycin, L-708,365 and interestingly erythromycin, showed greater bacterial clearance than azithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299 in a localized infection model that measured clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from mouse thigh tissues. Our results indicate that L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 exhibit improved acid stability and were at least equally efficacious as presently marketed macrolide/azalide antibiotics.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Protein binding and serum bactericidal activities of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, the protein binding and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) of vancomycin and teicoplanin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were investigated in six healthy volunteers. Total concentrations in serum 1 h postadministration of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 25.5 +/- 2.7 and 10.8 +/- 8.9 mg/liter, respectively; mean free concentrations were 14.6 +/- 2.0 and 0.6 +/- 0.9 mg/liter, respectively. Protein binding for vancomycin was 36.9% +/- 2.87%, and that for teicoplanin was 97.4% +/- 2.6%. SBA determined in pooled human serum at 1 h against S. aureus ranged from 1:8 to 1:32 for both vancomycin and teicoplanin. Against S. pyogenes SBA at 1 h ranged from 1:16 to 1:128 for vancomycin and 1:256 to 1:2,048 for teicoplanin. In vitro kill curve studies showed that vancomycin is slowly bactericidal and that teicoplanin is bacteriostatic. Despite having less in vitro cidal activity against the study isolates and having low or unrecordable levels of free drug in serum, teicoplanin demonstrated a similar or better SBA than vancomycin. SBA was more closely related to the total drug level (r = 0.77 for S. aureus and r = 0.79 for S. pyogenes) than the free level of teicoplanin (r = 0.59 for S. aureus and r = 0.56 for S. pyogenes). The high level of protein binding of teicoplanin did not seem to impair its antibacterial activity as measured by its SBA.
TI  - [A new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  - Dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. This is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. The following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used. The method described by the European Committee for Standardization was followed. Test microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different marks). They were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group A), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the first experiment showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. A great proportion of the dental handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. Even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. The results of the third experiment were unclear. The tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) were used. On the other hand, when Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. This difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. In conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.
TI  - Fatal craniocervical necrotizing fasciitis in an immunocompetent patient: a case  report and literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniocervical necrotizing fasciitis (CCNF) is a rapidly progressive, severe bacterial infection of the superficial fascial planes of the head and neck. Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and obligate anaerobic bacteria are common pathogens. The disease usually results from a dental source or facial trauma. Extensive fascial necrosis and severe systemic toxicity are common manifestations of CCNF. Recently the lay press has referred to necrotizing fasciitis in several articles about "flesh eating" bacteria, which have resulted in several deaths. METHODS: We report the first case of a fatality in an otherwise immunocompetent patient. The patient was a 66-year-old black man with no identifiable source of infection and no history or evidence of immunocompromising disorders. RESULTS: Despite aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, he died 30 hours after admission from multisystem organ failure secondary to overwhelming sepsis. CONCLUSION: Treatment consists of early recognition of CCNF combined with aggressive surgical debridement and drainage of the involved necrotic fascia and tissue along with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic coverage. Although 11 other fatal cases of CCNF have been previously reported, all had an underlying medical problem which created an immunocompromised state, usually diabetes mellitus or chronic alcoholism. We present a case report and literature review along with a discussion of the related anatomy.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil against community-acquired respiratory tract infections].
AB  - We investigated clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil (CEMT-PI) in community-acquired respiratory tract infections and obtained the following findings. 1. Of the 420 respiratory tract infection cases that were treated with CEMT-PI according to a same protocol at a total of 42 institutions in Tokyo, Kanagawa-ken, Saitama-ken and Chiba-ken from February to the beginning of April 1994, 359 cases in which clinical evaluations were considered possible were selected as the subjects of the clinical study. Regarding genders of patients, slightly more females (56.3%) than males were included. Diagnoses given to these patients included laryngopharygealitis (60.7%), tonsillitis (14.2%) and acute bronchitis (13.6). Outpatients accounted for 94.4% of the subjects. 2. For the bacteriological study, a written material describing the method of collecting specimens, storage and transport in detail was distributed to the above mentioned institutions. The isolation and identification of suspected causative bacteria, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and investigation of beta-lactamase production were conducted all together. Suspected causative bacteria were detected from 238 (66.3%) out of the 359 cases. They included 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 76 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 20 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 17 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis. 3. Clinical efficacy rates (the ratio of those excellent+good) among those who were treated with 1 CEMT-PI tablet (194 mg, titer) twice a day was 76.5% and among those who were given 2 tablets twice a day was 87.4%. The improvement rate of the latter was higher at a significant level of P < 0.05. 4. The clinical efficacies classified by suspected causative bacteria (single bacterium) were 93.3% against M.(B.) catarrhalis, 91.7% against beta-streptococci, 87.1% against H. influenzae and 78.4% against S. pneumoniae, etc. Though 7 (9.2%) of the 76 strains of S. pneumoniae were benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), the bacteriological efficacy was assessed either excellent or good in all of the 7 patients from whom PISP were detected. The clinical efficacy was assessed 100.0% in those from which a plural number of bacteria were detected. The 13 cases from which small numbers of Staphylococcus aureus was detected with other bacterium were also included in these cases.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the gene for a novel superantigen produced by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and expression of the recombinant protein.
AB  - We previously reported that the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis produces a superantigen (YPM, Y. pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen) that expands T cells bearing V betas 3, 9, 13.1, and 13.2 in an MHC class II-dependent manner. Based on the previously determined N-terminal 23 amino acids of YPM (T-D-Y-D-N-T-L-N-S-I-P-S-L-R-I-P-N-I-A-T-Y-T-G- (one-letter code)), we cloned the ypm gene and analyzed the nucleotide sequence. The gene encodes a 151-amino acid protein with a 20-amino acid signal peptide at its N terminus. The recombinant YPM expressed by the cloned gene exerted a mitogenic activity on human PBMC at a concentration of approximately 1 pg/ml. T cells bearing V beta 13.3 were preferentially expanded as well as T cells bearing the same V beta repertoires stimulated by native YPM. T cells were stimulated by the recombinant YPM in the presence of either fixed or unfixed HLA class II-transfected mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, sequence diversity in the junctional region of the TCR beta-chain containing the V beta 3 element could be observed after stimulation by the recombinant YPM. These results indicate that YPM belongs to the category of superantigens and should be included as a novel member. The amino acid sequence of the mature protein showed no significant homology to other superantigens derived from Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This observation, together with the substantially smaller m.w. suggest that ypm must have evolved from a different ancestral gene.
TI  - Subclinical mastitis and milk production in primiparous Simmental cows.
AB  - The prevalence of subclinical mastitis in beef cows was investigated and its relationship with milk production and 205-d adjusted calf weaning weights (ADJWW) determined. Primiparous Simmental cows (n = 25) were milked six times at approximately 30-d intervals. Before each milking, milk samples were aseptically collected from each quarter for bacteriological analyses. After recording milk weights, samples were obtained for determination of somatic cell counts (SCC), butterfat (BF), and protein (PRO). Somatic cell counts were transformed to Dairy Herd Improvement Association linear scores for statistical analyses. Cows were retrospectively assigned to one of two groups based on their SCC linear score being either less than (LOSCC) or more than (HISCC) 4.5, which corresponded to a SCC of 292 x 10(3) cells/mL. Milk samples from 32% (8/25) of the cows and 18% (18/100) of the quarters were culture-positive for bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus species, Actinomyces pyogenes, and[or] coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) at one or more times. Milk production was higher in LOSCC than in HISCC cows (6.3 +/- .2 vs 5.4 +/- .3 kg/24 h; P = .004). Mean SCC linear score tended to be negatively correlated with mean milk production over the entire study (r = -.36; P = .08). Adjusted weaning weights were similar between calves suckling LOSCC and HISCC cows (243 +/- 5 vs 236 +/- 10 kg; P = .57). In summary, milk SCC concentrations in primiparous Simmental cows were highly variable. Higher SCC concentrations were associated with lower milk production in cows.
TI  - [Cephalosporin treatment of maxillary sinusitis].
AB  - A new oral prodrug cephalosporin, cefcanel daloxate, was compared with cefaclor,  another oral cephalosporin, in the treatment of acute purulent maxillary sinusitis. Three hundred fifty-four patients with purulent sinus secretion were recruited and randomized at thirteen European ENT clinics for the double blind study. The patients were treated with either cefcanel 300 mg tablets twice daily or cefaclor 250 mg capsules three times daily for ten days. Apart from the sinus puncture and secretion aspiration, the existence of sinus pain and purulent nasal secretion were inclusion criteria. Between days 12 and 15, reaspiration of the sinus was performed and signs and symptoms noted. The latter were checked again at the final visit between days 25 and 30. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for safety evaluation at inclusion, during and after treatment. The bacteriological culture of the purulent sinus secretion in 58.4% of patients revealed Haemophilus influenzae (37.9%) as the most prevalent pathogen followed by Streptococcus pneumonia (19.7%), while Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus amounted each to 6-7% only. The overall clinical outcome was defined as cure/improvement in 83.3% of the patients in the cefcanel group and 89.3% in the cefaclor group, respectively. No statistically significant differences with regard to efficacy were found between the two treatment groups. Adverse events, mostly related to gastrointestinal reactions, were reported by 36 patients (15.7%) in the cefcanel group and by 16 (13.4%) in the cefaclor group. Both cefcanel 300 mg twice daily and cefaclor 250 mg three times daily were highly effective with only minimal adverse events in the treatment of acute purulent maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - [Pharmacological study on the dry distillation tar of delipidated soybean (Glyteer) (5): Antimicrobial activity].
AB  - Glyteer (GL) possessed a broad antimicrobial spectra against bacteria and fungi.  The antimicrobial activity of GL was bactericidal action, but not bacteriostatic action. GL was more effective against fungi than bacteria. GL ointment also showed antimicrobial activity equal to that of GL. Furthermore, GL had an effect on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Resistance to GL was not induced in broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. These results suggest that GL applied externally exerts a potent effect as an anti-microbial drug for dermopathy with various microbialpathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa may be due to an  anti-inflammatory action of ichthammol or a dehydrating effect of glycerine on the oedematous ear canal. Its antimicrobial activity, if any, against the common organisms in otitis externa is not well known. A study of the antibacterial property of glycerine-ichthammol as measured by a growth inhibition test and a modified cidal assay, showed inhibition of selected gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) by ichthammol and glycerine-ichthammol combination, but only negligible antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Candida albicans was also weakly inhibited. As the activity against gram negative organisms is minimal, incorporation of an anti-gram negative antibiotic such as gentamicin in the glycerine-ichthammol compound to enhance its antibacterial spectrum is suggested.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Superantigens and pseudosuperantigens of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Superantigens use an elaborate and unique mechanism of T lymphocyte stimulation.  Prototype superantigen are the pyrogenic exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Many candidate proteins of bacterial, viral and protozoal origin have recently been reported to be superantigens. In most cases the evidence that these proteins are in fact superantigens is highly indirect. In this review the evidence that gram-positive cocci produce superantigens other than the pyrogenic exotoxins is critically discussed. Evidence in described demonstrating that the epidermolytic toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and the pyrogenic exotoxin B and M-proteins of Streptococcus pyrogenes are not superantigens. Criteria are described for acceptance of a candidate as a superantigen.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - [The effect of cefaclor and cefixime on nasopharyngeal pathogens in children].
AB  - Changes in nasopharyngeal flora were investigated in children with acute otitis media and with acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis in whom antibiotic therapy of relatively long duration was required until substantial improvement in clinical findings was achieved. 1. The antibiotics used were two cephalosporins, i.e., cefaclor (CCL) and cefixime (CFIX), administered to 18 patients each for 1 week and to 26 and 20 patients, respectively, for 2 weeks. Bacteriologic examination of the nasopharyngeal mucosa was performed at the first visit and at 1 week in those who underwent antibiotic therapy for 1 week, and at the first visit and at 1 and 2 weeks in those treated with antibiotics for 2 weeks. 2. The elimination rates for the infecting microorganisms in the patients in the CCL-treated group were 30% for Haemophilus influenzae, 83% for Staphylococcus aureus, 100% for Streptococcus pyogenes and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae at 1 week, and 18% for H. influenzae, 100% for S. aureus and 100% for S. pyogenes at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Replacement of S. aureus and S. pyogenes by H. influenzae was observed. 3. The elimination rates for infecting bacteria in the patients in the CFIX-treated groups were 61% for H. influenzae, 50% for S. aureus, 75% for S. pyogenes, 80% for S. pneumoniae and 100% for Moraxella catarrhalis at 1 week, and 72% for H. influenzae, 0% for S. aureus, 100% for S. pyogenes, and 0% for S. pneumoniae at 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The elimination rate for H. influenzae at 2 weeks was significantly higher than the corresponding value for the CCL-treated group. Replacement of H. influenzae by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae and of S. pyogenes by S. aureus was detected. 4. There was one patient with acute otitis media in the CFIX-treated group in whom a clinical relapse occurred due to H. influenzae persisters in the nasopharynx. Thus the diagnosis in this patient was so-called "recurrent otitis media". 5. H. influenzae tended to persist after exposure to therapeutically adequate concentrations of CCL, as did S. aureus and S. pneumoniae following treatment with CFIX. Thus, it would seem that ample heed must be given to persistence, particularly of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, the most common causative agents of acute otitis media in childhood. 6. A significant rise in the MICs of the cephalosporins was observed in 4 of 43 patients in whom the same type of organism was isolated from the nasopharynx at weekly intervals during antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Wound management in burn centres in the United Kingdom.
AB  - Despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and  the practice of early tangential excision, infection of the burn wound remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to survey and compare wound management and antibiotic usage in burn surgery in all UK burn centres. A postal questionnaire was used, followed up by telephone. Answers were obtained from all 39 units treating burns in the UK. A written policy on antibiotic usage was used by 13 centres. Excisions were covered routinely by prophylactic antibiotic therapy in 18 units, and three of these used antibiotic cover during all procedures in which the wound was manipulated. No routine antibiotic cover was given in 21 units. All units obtained surface swab cultures, but only two performed punch biopsy of the wounds. Quantitative bacteriology (counting colony forming units) was employed by three centres. Most units cleaned the burn with saline (17 of 39) or chlorhexidine (eight of 39) but combinations of these and other agents were also used. Nearly half (17 of 37) of those who replied had not seen any cases of proven or suspected toxic shock syndrome in the past 2 years. Four units gave prophylaxis against Staphylococcus aureus, and four gave antibiotics against Streptococcus pyogenes, despite recommendations in the literature. Twenty-nine units gave no prophylaxis. This study has revealed that there is no consensus on antibiotic usage amongst centres treating burns in the UK and that most units rely on surface swab cultures to monitor infection.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in Japan.
AB  - Bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. Of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. Major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pnuemoniae and S. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. New quinolones and new generation cephems were active against H. influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Only one strain of S. aureus was methicillin-resistant. As regards other pathogens, 6.5% of S. pneumoniae and 14.9% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. MRSA was found infrequently. But ampicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
TI  - Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. A single IM injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. Until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic GAS carriers. Since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. Explanations for recurrent GAS tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family member or peer, copathogenic colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; GAS tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. When therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. Several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating GAS and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. In previously untreated GAS throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences are greater. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Persistent acute otitis media: II. Antimicrobial treatment.
AB  - In this three-year prospective study, 137 children with acute otitis media (AOM)  that had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent AOM) underwent tympanocentesis to determine additional antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolate(s). One hundred eleven children with AOM not previously treated are described for comparison. In the persistent AOM group middle ear aspirates grew Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Haemophilus influenzae (7%), Brahamella catarrhalis (7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (6%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), two pathogens (3%) or no bacterial growth (49%); pathogens in previously untreated AOM were similar but fewer patients (30%) had no bacterial growth. After tympanocentesis additional antimicrobial therapy for persistent AOM patients utilizing drugs shown to be effective in vitro against the isolated pathogen failed to produce clinical resolution of infection in 27 (28%) of ears. Differing clinical efficacy was observed with various antimicrobials: amoxicillin (57% failure); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75% failure); cefaclor (37% failure); cefixime (23% failure); amoxicillin/clavulanate (12% failure); and cefuroxime axetil (13% failure). Presumptive clinical cure for previously untreated AOM patients was similar to that for untreated AOM except for fewer amoxicillin failures (30%). We conclude that clinical failure in persistent AOM occurs (1) even when no pathogen is isolated from tympanocentesis (50% of patients) and (2) despite demonstrated in vitro activity against culture-proved pathogens.
TI  - Persistent acute otitis media: I. Causative pathogens.
AB  - In this prospective study tympanocentesis was performed to determine the pathogens isolated from middle ear fluid of 200 ears in 137 children with acute otitis media (AOM) which had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent AOM). For comparison tympanocentesis from 154 ears in 111 children with AOM not previously treated are described. Patients were enrolled from October, 1989, until September, 1992. In the persistent AOM group amoxicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most frequently used antimicrobials before tympanocentesis. Middle ear aspirates produced no pathogenic bacterial growth in 49% of persistent AOM patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 24%, Haemophilus influenzae in 7%, Branhamella catarrhalis in 7%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5% and two pathogens in 3%. Two (18%) of 11 S. pneumoniae isolates tested were penicillin-resistant; 1 was intermediate and 1 was highly resistant. Ten (83%) of 12 H. influenzae and all of 11 B. catarrhalis AOM isolates produced beta-lactamase. In comparison previously untreated AOM patients produced no bacterial growth from tympanocentesis in 30%, S. pneumoniae in 36% (8% penicillin-resistant), H. influenaze in 13% (44% beta-lactamase-producing) and B. catarrhalis in 11% (85% beta-lactamase producing). AOM which is persistent after initial empiric antimicrobial therapy may be caused by middle ear inflammation after bacteria are killed or involve penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae or B. catarrhalis more commonly than occurs in AOM which has not been recently treated.
TI  - Recurrence of infection after revision of infected hip arthroplasties.
AB  - We performed revision surgery for infected arthroplasty in 98 hips (96 patients). In 28 hips infection persisted. Of the remaining 70 hips, 61 (87%) were reviewed after a mean interval of 5.9 years (1 to 17). Infection occurred in 10% of these after three years and in 26% after ten years. The infection rate after initially successful revision for septic arthroplasty is higher than after revision for aseptic loosening and the risk of developing infection continues for many years.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555, a new oral penem, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1. MICs were determined for 6 drugs, SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefdinir (CFDN) against 20 strains of bacteria isolated from patients who were subsequently treated with SY5555. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 microgram/ml against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, and MICs were from < or = 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae. These MIC values were equivalent or superior to those of the other 5 drugs. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-negative bacilli were 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and these values were equivalent to those of the other drugs, except CPDX. The MIC of SY5555 was 0.39 microgram/ml against 2 strains of Escherichia coli, and this value was equivalent or superior to those of CVA/AMPC and CCL, similar or inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, and inferior to that of CTM. The MICs of several drugs were determined for 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis and 30 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients before this clinical study. The MICs of SY5555 against the 10 strains of B. pertussis were compared with those of 7 drugs, CCL, CTM, CPDX, ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM) and erythromycin (EM). The MIC of SY5555 was 0.78 microgram/ml against all of the strains. This value was superior to those of CCL, CTM and CPDX, similar or inferior to that of IPM and inferior to those of PIPC and EM. The MICs of SY5555 against the 30 strains of C. jejuni were compared with those of 7 drugs. CCL, CTM, CPDX, CFDN, ABPC, IPM and EM, and the MIC of SY5555 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml or 0.05 microgram/ml and these values were equivalent or superior to those of the 7 reference drugs. 2. SY5555 dry syrup was administered orally at 30 min. after meals, to a total of 5 patients, at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg to 2 patients each and at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg to one patient and the plasma concentrations were determined. Peak concentrations were detected 1 to 3 hours after administration in all patients and the peak concentrations were 0.93 and 1.21 micrograms/ml at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, 2.85 and 5.49 micrograms/ml at the 10.0 mg/kg dose and 5.79 micrograms/ml at the 15.0 mg/kg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and laboratory studies on SY5555 in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Clinical effects of SY5555 dry syrup, a new oral penem antibiotic, were analysed  in 20 children with various bacterial infections. Ages of the patients varied from 8 months to 14 years. Doses of SY5555 were varied from 12.8 mg/kg/day to 30.5 mg/kg/day, and it was administered in 3 divided dosages. Clinical efficacy rates were as follows; 6/7 in acute bronchitis, 5/5 in pharyngotonsillitis, 3/3 in acute otitis media and 2/2 in cystitis and 3/3 in impetigo contagiosa. The overall rate was 95.0% (19/20). Bacteriologically, eradications were obtained with 1/2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3/3 of Staphylococcus aureus, 1/1 of Haemophilus influenzae, and each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens. Diarrhea was observed in 1 patient. And elevated eosinophiles or GPT was observed in one patient each. In vivo pharmacokinetics of SY5555 was examined in 2 cases. Peak plasma levels were observed at 1 hour after dosage in one patient and at 2 hours in another upon oral administration of 8.3 mg/kg of SY5555, and peak levels were 2.44 and 1.38 micrograms/ml respectively. Half-lives of SY5555 were 1.39 and 0.59 hr. Concentrations of SY5555 in urine after administration were 70.2 (2-4 hrs.) to 91.0 (0-5 hrs.) micrograms/ml, respectively. SY5555 dry syrup is considered as an useful and safe antibiotic in treating the infectious diseases in children.
TI  - [Clinical study of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - SY5555 dry syrup (powder to be dissolved before use) was clinically used in pediatric patients. The following results were obtained: 1. The subjects were 6 pediatric patients including 1 case each with pharyngitis, tonsillitis, lacunar tonsillitis and impetigo contagiosa and 2 cases with scarlet fever. The drug was administered at a daily dose of 14.5-29.0 mg/kg divided into 3 dosages. The clinical results were excellent in 5 cases and good in 1 case with an efficacy rate of 100%. 2. Identified bacteria included 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Five strains were eradicated but 1 strain still remained with an bacteriological eradication rate of 83.3%. 3. No side effects were observed throughout the study period. In laboratory test results, elevated eosinophil count was observed in only 1 case. 4. Patients' compliance was good in general. 5. Based on the results mentioned above, the drug was considered to be a useful new oral antibiotic in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new oral penem, SY5555, in infants and children].
AB  - A clinical study was performed on SY5555, a newly developed penem antibiotic, in  children. SY5555 was given orally to 14 patients at 19-29 mg/kg/day in 3 doses for 4 to 12 days. Clinical evaluations were made on the 14 patients including 4 with pharyngitis, 7 with tonsillitis, one with urinary tract infection, and 2 with impetigo. Overall clinical effects were excellent in 2, good in 12, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) were all eradicated. As to adverse reactions, mild diarrhea was observed in 4 patients. These data suggest that SY5555 is a useful oral antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies were carried out on SY5555, a new oral penem, in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. The clinical efficacies were examined in a total 31 patients consisting of 4 patients with pharyngitis, 10 with purulent tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever, 7 with impetigo, one with balanitis, one with cellulitis and 4 with UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 96.8% (30/31). Bacteriological efficacies of SY5555 were examined on identified pathogens including 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 of Haemophilus influenzae, one of Escherichia coli and one of Citrobacter freundii. The bacteriological eradication rate was 81.0%. As for side effects, loose stool in one patient was noted. Abnormal laboratory findings test results included eosinophilia in 2 patients, eosinophilia and elevation of serum transaminase in one patient, and thrombocytosis in another.
TI  - [Isolation of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, in the oral cavity and the effect of tobacco and gargling on oral flora].
AB  - We investigated the distribution of oral alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, which compose an oral defense mechanism. Detection rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes and S. aureus derived from the tonsil was higher than in other portions, the tongue, cheek, gingiva, or saliva. It has suggested that tonsillar bacterial flora are mainly a defense mechanism. The oral flora in healthy smokers was compared with healthy non-smokers to investigate the influence of tobacco on oral bacterial flora. The results showed that the detection rate of S. aureus in smokers was higher while that of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against S. aureus was lower. However, the detection rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes in smokers was as high as in non-smokers. It is suggested that it was easy for S. aureus to adhere to the oral mucosa in smokers, and was considered to influence the strain which produces beta-lactamase for medical treatment. We investigated the influence of gargling on oral bacterial flora by comparing the amount of bacteria before and after gargling with popidine-iodine gargle and saline solution. It was shown that alpha-streptococci, a main component of normal oral flora were decreased after gargling in both smokers and non-smokers. Furthermore, it was shown that group A Streptococcus was not decreased after gargling, and it was concluded that use of gargle medicinal mouth wash in bacillus carriers should be studied further.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.

TI  - [Bacterial study in patients with chronic disease of the palatine tonsils].
AB  - At the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic in Novi Sad, 58 patients, from 2 to 53 years of age, with chronic palatine tonsillitis were bacteriologically examined. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in most patients and was detected in 21 patients on the surface of the tonsil and in 25 patients at the place of a cut. Streptococcus pyogenes group A occurred only in 3 patients, group B in 1 patient which amounts to 5.17%, and 1.72%. The percentage of patients in whom rheumatism occurred was similar. The author points out the fact that there is a great disproportion between the number of patients who undergo surgery and number of complications at distant organs and appeals to reduction of indications for tonsillectomy to a reasonable level.
TI  - Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha expression in vivo and in vitro: the role of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the cell wall of most gram-positive bacteria, has been shown to play a significant role in the initiation and progression of bacterial infection. However, little is known of its position in the cytokine network involved in the induction and perpetuation of inflammation. In this study, we assessed whether the macrophage activating and chemotactic cytokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) was expressed in the setting of localized gram-positive infection. Furthermore, we determined whether LTA purified from either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes could induce the expression of MIP-1 alpha mRNA and protein from human blood monocytes. Immunohistochemical staining of human endocardial samples obtained from patients with acute S. aureus endocarditis revealed cell-associated MIP-1 alpha expression by neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro with LTA isolated from either S. aureus or S. pyogenes resulted in both the time- and dose-dependent expression of MIP-1 alpha mRNA. Similarly, staphylococcal and streptococcal LTA induced the dose-dependent production of MIP-1 alpha protein after 24 h in culture. These studies suggest that LTA may play an important role in triggering the recruitment and activation of leukocytes that characterizes the host response to gram-positive bacterial invasion.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - [Microbiological study of the nasopharynx].
AB  - A microbiological study of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx have been carried out in 90 children subjected to adenoidectomy by chronically hypertrophied and infected adenoids. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most important pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infection. Adenoidectomy produces a physiological effect on the nasopharyngeal microflora by converting an abnormal flora into a nearly normal one. It has been found out that there is a relation between nasopharyngeal pathogens and the seasonal periods, showing a decrease in summer.
TI  - Serial serum C-reactive protein to monitor recovery from acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Serial C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate determinations were compared with clinical course and outcome at 1 to 2 months in 63 children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. High CRP values (163 +/- 108 mg/liter) on admission began to descend after the second day of treatment. From the fourth day on higher (P = 0.03 to P = 0.0001) CRP values distinguished a complicated from an uneventful course of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and the patients symptomatic at follow-up (P = 0.003 to P = 0.0001) from asymptomatic ones. Children who developed extensive radiographic changes had elevated CRP values for a longer time (32 +/- 13 days) than children with typical changes (11 +/- 6 days, P = 0.0001). Erythrocyte sedimentation rates did not identify the type of clinical course but higher values on Days 4 to 7 distinguished children symptomatic at follow-up (P = 0.02) from asymptomatic ones. Monitoring serial CRP values can alert the physician to complications and predict outcome earlier than clinical signs or roentgenograms.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatrics].
AB  - We assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of SY5555 in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. In vitro antibacterial activities of SY5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN). Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SY5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. In cases of Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 against Haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 was less potent than that of CPDX. 2. Forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with SY5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). The clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. Bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. Side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. The palatability of SY5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. From the above results, SY5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Three erythromyxin-resistant Swedish isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, representing different T-types, were studied. Two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (MIC > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (MIC 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. In each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated Mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. The three plasmids pSE701, pSE702, and pSE703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. Novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain ER559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pSE703. Furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. One of the plasmids, pSE702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within S. pyogenes. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that the resistance determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid pAM beta 1 of Enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pE194 of Staphylococcus aureus. The copy numbers of pSE702 and pSE703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1 for pSE701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. The plasmids pSE702 and pAM beta 1 showed about 80% homology in DNA-DNA hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.
TI  - [Spiramycin (rovamycin), a macrolide antibiotic for oral treatment of outpatient  pneumonia].
AB  - Spiramycin activity against acute pneumonia has been studied in 21 outpatients (15 adults and 6 children). The drug was administered orally twice daily in a dose 3,000,000 units. The course lasted from 7 to 14 days. All the cases were confirmed roentgenologically. The disease ran a moderate-severity course. The response rate reached 95.2%. Another course of antibiotic therapy was not needed. Side effects were not registered. Bacteriological efficacy of spiramycin made up 71.3%. 14 out of 16 isolated strains of causative agents (S.pneumoniae, S.pyogenes, S.aureus, H.influenzae in 5, 1, 7 and 3 patients, respectively) proved sensitive to spiramycin. 2 patients developed mycoplasma infection diagnosed serologically. The findings confirm high therapeutic efficacy of spiramycin, its good tolerance. Spiramycin may be considered the drug of the priority choice in outpatient treatment of acute pneumonia.

TI  - Characterization and distribution of insertion sequence IS1239 in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The human pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes causes pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and toxic-shock-like syndrome. The bacterium synthesizes several extracellular products, including the recently described streptococcal superantigen SSA, a molecule that shares considerable homology with several Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins. While studying allelic variation at the ssa locus, six isolates expressing serotypes M4, M23, M33, M41, M43, and provisional type PT4854, were identified that had PCR products about 40-bp larger than expected, and one isolate (M15) had an amplified fragment that was more than 1-kb larger than expected. All six isolates have a 34-bp insert located 103 bp 5' of the ssa start codon. The larger product is a result of a 1110-bp insertion at the analogous location. The complementary strand of this insert has a 981-bp open reading frame that potentially encodes a 326-amino-acid polypeptide with substantial homology to the Escherichia coli IS30 transposase. Results of Southern blot analysis showed that at least twelve copies of the sequence are present in the serotype M15 S. pyogenes isolate. This element, designated IS1239, is the first simple insertion sequence described in group-A streptococci. Results of PCR screening showed that 26 of 78 (33%) S. pyogenes isolates expressing distinct M protein serotypes contained sequences with homology to IS1239, which means that the element is widely distributed in the species.
TI  - Antibacterial phenylpropanoid glycosides from Paulownia tomentosa Steud.
AB  - The butanol extract of Paulownia tomentosa stem showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SG511, 285 and 503), Streptococcus pyogenes (A308 and A77) and Streptococcus faecium MD8b etc. The most active compound of the extract was identified to be campneoside I, which had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. From such antibacterial activity, the methoxy group of campneoside I was postulated to be the essential element for the antibacterial activity.
TI  - Activation of arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse macrophages by bacterial amphiphiles.
AB  - The relative activities of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from four Gram-positive bacteria were compared to different lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations for activation of arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Total eicosanoid was determined in cultures labeled with [3H]-arachidonic acid. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) were determined by EIA analysis. The relative potencies of the different preparations were: smooth LPS from Salmonella abortus > or = Re-LPS from Salmonella minnesota (R-595) > or = LTA from Streptococcus pyogenes approximately Streptococcus faecalis approximately Staphylococcus aureus > or = monophosphoryl lipid A derived from the Re-LPS >> LTA from Bacillus subtilis. Activation of eicosanoid release was inhibited by staurosporin for all of the amphiphiles tested. Treatment of the macrophage cultures with LTA from S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, and S. aureus, either in the presence or absence of indomethacin, desensitized the cells to eicosanoid release on subsequent challenge with LPS. The desensitized cells remained responsive to the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate. LPS from Gram-negative bacteria has immunostimulatory and endotoxic activities which result, in part, from the release of eicosanoids and other mediators from activated macrophages. The similarities in the patterns of cell activation by LPS and LTA suggest that lipoteichoic acids might contribute to the pathogenicities of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome related to simultaneous Staphylococcus aureus epiglottic abscess and group A streptococcal pharyngitis with bacteremia.
AB  - A case of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is reported in which both a TSST-1-producing Staphylococcus aureus strain and a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal strain (GABHS) were involved. The S. aureus group I strain was isolated from an epiglottic abscess, and the GABHS strain from tonsils and blood cultures. Acute intubation was needed because of obstruction of the airways by swollen and hyperemic mucous membranes in the oro- and hypopharynx together with external edema around the neck. Intravenous therapy with penicillin G was instituted initially on account of GABHS cellulitis and bacteremia. The patient's condition deteriorated during this treatment, and improvement did not occur until drainage and intravenous dicloxacillin therapy was instituted. It is not possible in this case to draw any conclusions as to which of the two organisms caused the TSS or if they were both involved.
TI  - Intraphagocytic killing of gram-positive bacteria by ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The intraphagocytic killing of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Corynebacterium group D2 by ciprofloxacin (0.1, 1 and 5 mg/L) within human neutrophils was determined. The organisms showed different susceptibility to neutrophil killing mechanisms. The neutrophils with intact and impaired (by phenylbutazone treatment) O2-dependent killing mechanisms were studied. The minimum concentrations of ciprofloxacin to kill 90% of phagocytosed bacteria within untreated neutrophils after 2 h were 1 mg/L for S. aureus and Corynebacterium group D2, and 0.1 mg/L for S. pyogenes. In contrast, exposure for 3 h was required to achieve similar cidal effects within phenylbutazone treated neutrophils. Synergic interaction between ciprofloxacin and the O2-dependent mechanisms of phagocytes was found. The reactive oxygen metabolites produced in the respiratory burst did not affect the intraphagocytic activity of ciprofloxacin. Phenylbutazone treatment of phagocytes would be a good experimental model to study intraphagocytic killing by drugs in situations where the oxidative mechanisms of neutrophils are impaired (for example AIDS and chronic granulomatous disease).
TI  - Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA.
AB  - In this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic DNA. The target DNA sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the S. pneumoniae DNA polymerase I gene (pol I). PCR products of pure cultures of a set of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing S. pneumoniae. We were able to detect 2 fg of purified S. pneumoniae DNA. There were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. nontypeable H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The addition of EDTA and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the PCR reaction mixture inhibited the PCR assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to PCR reaction mixture did not interfere with the ability to detect the presence of S. pneumoniae DNA.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (V). The pattern of distribution on bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from patients with respiratory infections, who were seen in six private clinics, and clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin].
AB  - The pattern of distribution of bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from the same specimen recovered from the throat swab or the sputum of 479 patients with respiratory infections who were seen in six private clinics in Sendai City of Japan during the period from October to November in 1992 (period I) and from January to February in 1993 (period II) was documented. Of the 479 patients, 234 had acute pharyngitis, 145 had acute bronchitis, 96 had influenza, 21 had acute tonsillitis, 5 had acute pneumonia and 9 had other respiratory infections. One hundred (42.4%) strains of potential pathogen and one strain of M. pneumoniae were recovered from 236 cases in period I, and 66 (27.2%) strains of potential pathogen, one strain of M. pneumonae and 73 strains of Influenza virus (30.0%: 43 of type A Hong-Kong and 30 of type B) from 243 cases in period II. Of the 166 strains, major isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (56 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (15 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (17 strains), Esherichia coli (4 strains), Klebsiella spp. (35 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (23 strains). Only one strain of S. aureus was resistant to methicillin (MIC: 50 micrograms/ml). None of S. pneumoniae was resistant to 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 113 cases and roxythromycin to 220 cases by doctors in charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Major histocompatibility complex class II binding site for streptococcal pyrogenic (erythrogenic) toxin A.
AB  - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) is an important pathogenicity factor of group A streptococci. It is a member of the family of "superantigens" produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and its T lymphocyte stimulating activity is involved into the pathogenesis of certain diseases caused by pyogenic streptococci. In this study we have produced and characterized recombinant SPEA molecules in Escherichia coli. These molecules are indistinguishable from natural SPEA in both T cell stimulatory and HLA class II binding activities. Human class II molecules are more efficient than mouse class II molecules in presenting SPEA to T cells. In binding tests to major histocompatibility complex class II-positive cells SPEA competes with staphylococcal enterotoxin B and A but not with toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
TI  - Comparison of the composition and opsonic activities of imported and South African-manufactured intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - We compared the composition and opsonic activities for two common microbial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) of various imported intravenous (IV) (Sandoglobulin, Octagam and Gammagard) and intramuscular (IM) (Beriglobin and Globuman Berna) immunoglobulin (Ig) preparations with those of the corresponding locally manufactured products, Polygam (IV) and Intragam (IM). When tested at equivalent concentrations (1 g/100 ml) the total IgG and IgG subclass concentrations of the various IV and IM preparations were similar. All the test preparations (IV and IM) possessed similar opsonic activity for S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings demonstrate that, in respect of IgG content and protective biological activity, Intragam and Polygam, the locally manufactured IM and IV Ig preparations, respectively, compared extremely favourably with the corresponding imported products.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome in 8 children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in a paediatric hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. METHOD: Analysis of the medical records on 155 patients admitted between January 1982 and January 1992 suffering from shock, 8 of whom had TSS. RESULTS: Five out of 8 TSS patients were under 5 years of age. All the patients needed mechanical ventilation. All patients survived. In 7 patients a probably causative focus of infection was found. The cultures of 6 patients showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, those of 2 patients showed Lancefield group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (bacterial culture in one, increased antibody titer in the other). Systematic phage typing was not performed. CONCLUSION: Although TSS is a relatively rare disease in young children, it is a potentially lethal one, early recognition of which is very important.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (CDTR) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from November, 1993 to February, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results were as follows: 1. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of CDTR against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. The MIC of CDTR against CEPs-resistant E. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. Since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, CDTR will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.
TI  - Acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - We prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. Pathogens typical of acute otitis media (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. Pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). Pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while P aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1% versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). This suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a fibronectin/fibrinogen-binding protein from group A streptococci.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid and several streptococcal proteins have been reported to bind fibronectin (Fn) or fibrinogen (Fgn), which may serve as host receptors. We searched for such proteins by screening a library of genes from M type 5 group A streptococci cloned into Escherichia coli. Lysates of clones were probed with biotinylated Fn and biotinylated Fgn. One clone expressed a 54-kDa protein that reacted with Fn and Fgn. The protein, termed FBP54, was purified and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-FBP54 serum reacted with purified, recombinant FBP54 and with a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility in extracts of M type 5, 6, and 24 streptococci. Anti-FBP54 serum also reacted with 5 of 15 strains of intact, live streptococci, suggesting that FBP54 may be a surface antigen. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the gene is found in group A streptococci but not in Staphylococcus aureus or E. coli. The cloned gene was sequenced and contained an open reading frame encoding a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 54,186. Partial amino acid sequencing of purified FBP54 confirmed that this open reading frame encoded the protein. As determined by utilizing fusion proteins containing truncated forms of FBP54, the primary Fn/Fgn-binding domain appears to be contained in residues 1 to 89. These data suggest that FBP54 may be a surface protein of streptococci that reacts with both Fn and Fgn and therefore may participate in the adhesion of group A streptococci to host cells.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  - The clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. Their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). None had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. Three were admitted with intracranial complications. Bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included Streptococcus pneumonia (2), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. Acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. Antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. When antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. At least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. The prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Dynamics of emergence.
AB  - I have touched briefly here on the complex matrix of social, economic, political, and ecologic factors that have played a major role in the emergence of microbial diseases. But beyond these factors that contribute to the emergence of new infectious diseases, we must also recognize changes in microbial agents, human populations, insect vectors, and the ecologic relationships among them. Microbes and vectors swim in the evolutionary stream and they swim much faster than we do. Bacteria reproduce every 30 min; for them a millennium is compressed into a fortnight. Microbes were here, learning every trick for survival, 2 billion years before humans arrived, and it is likely that they will be here 2 billion years after we depart. Furthermore, science cannot halt the future occurrence of new microbes, which emerge from the evolutionary stream as a consequence of genetic events and selective pressures that favor the new over the old. It is nature's way. For all of these reasons, old and new infections will occur in the future as they have in the past. Surveillance efforts, both in the United States and other regions of the world, will be needed to blunt the emergence of such infections and to forestall epidemics and pandemics. But surveillance alone cannot detect the unexpected emergence of future microbes or prepare the defense against them. That will require a broadly based research effort to devise new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. We must swim with the microbes and study their survival and adaptation to new habitats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - Dual infections with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes causing toxic shock syndrome. Possible synergistic effects of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C.
AB  - We describe a 35-year-old woman with clinical, microbiologic, and serologic findings suggesting that the patient developed toxic shock syndrome as a result of dual infections caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Certain aspects of the pathogenesis of this toxin-related syndrome are reviewed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of Bridelia ferruginea (Euphorbiaceae).
AB  - Water and ethanol extracts of Bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. The extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella sp. The zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. Sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. The Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the Gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of cefdinir on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyrogenes.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of a new cephalosporin, cefdinir, were determined against a range of organisms using a viable counting technique. Cefdinir exerted considerable PAEs against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but no overall post-antibiotic inhibition of growth was detected against Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Exposure to cefdinir made the gram-negative organisms susceptible to the washing procedure used for drug removal, but this was followed by rapid recovery of viability in drug-free broth.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies in the pediatric field have been performed on biapenem (L-627), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, and the following results were obtained. 1. In the pharmacokinetic study, the plasma concentration of L-627 showed dose-dependant change: Cmax was 14.6 micrograms/ml and AUC was 15.4 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 6 mg/kg, while Cmax was 49.2 micrograms/ml and AUC was 60.1 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 12 mg/kg. After the administration of 6 mg/kg, the urinary concentration reached maximum within 2 hours and the cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours was 49.4%. 2. Antibacterial activities of L-627 against 27 strains of clinical isolates were determined. MICs of L-627 against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were sufficiently low, and those against such Gram-negative rods as Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Bordetella pertussis were satisfactory and as low as those of imipenem or ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies of L-627 were evaluated in 36 cases of bacterial infections. The overall efficacy rate was 100%, and excellent responses in 26 cases and good in 10 cases were obtained. As for bacteriological efficacies, all strains except 1 of B. pertussis were eradicated and a high eradication rate of 96.6% was obtained. 4. No side effects were observed in 37 evaluated cases. As abnormal laboratory test results, eosinophilia was noted in 2 cases (5.4%), but they returned to normal values rapidly after the drug was discontinued. From these results, it has been concluded that L-627 is a safe and effective drug to be used in treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.
TI  - Fibronectin receptors from gram-positive bacteria: comparison of active sites.
AB  - Many parasitic bacteria express fibronectin binding proteins that are located on  the cell surface. These proteins may act as adhesins and mediate the adherence of the microorganisms to fibronectin-containing host tissues. The ligand binding sites in the fibronectin receptor proteins from Gram-positive bacteria are composed of unique 37-48 amino acid long motifs that are repeated 3-4 times. We have now expressed the ligand binding sites of fibronectin receptors from Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae (two receptors), and Streptococcus pyogenes as recombinant proteins. The purified recombinant proteins have the expected molecular weights as indicated by electrospray mass spectroscopy although they migrate abnormally on SDS-PAGE. Each recombinant protein effectively inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled intact fibronectin or the N-terminal fibronectin domain to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The relative inhibitory potency of the different recombinant proteins was similar for all target bacteria and is reflected in their relative affinities for fibronectin. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the repeat units of the ligand binding site of the fibronectin receptor proteins were shown to inhibit the binding of the N-terminal fibronectin fragment to Streptococcus pyogenes cells. Together with amino acid sequence comparison, these data demonstrate that the repeat motif of the fibronectin receptor of Streptococcus pyogenes conforms to the consensus sequence previously reported for the Staphylococcus aureus receptor and to one of the Streptococcus dysgalactiae receptors (McGavin et al., 1993).
TI  - Recent advances in toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - The pathogenesis and treatment of toxic shock has become clearer even as its epidemiology has evolved. Nonmenstrual cases due to Staphylococcus aureus can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections are life threatening.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Bacterial superantigens in autoimmune arthritis.
AB  - Discoveries of the biological properties of bacterial superantigens have given rise to much speculation about their possible role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. There is an increasing body of data to support these speculations. This field of research has the potential to provide a long-elusive understanding of the mechanisms which underlie microbial involvement in the pathogenesis of autoimmune polyarthritides.
TI  - Modulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa adherence to the corneal surface by mucus.
AB  - To gain access to the corneal epithelium and cause infections keratitis, bacterial pathogens must first interact with ocular surface factors that could affect bacterial adherence. In this study, we demonstrated that the mucus layer, and, in particular, the mucin fraction of mucus, modulated adherence to intact corneal epithelium of Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not that of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Removal of endogenous mucus from rat or rabbit eyes increased the adherence of P. aeruginosa by 3- to 10-fold. Ocular mucus obtained from rat eyes, porcine stomach mucin, or bovine submaxillary gland mucin inhibited adherence of P. aeruginosa to uninjured corneal epithelium. The mucin fraction of ocular mucus, purified by ultracentrifugation, was found to contain the inhibitory activity, and inhibition was demonstrated at concentrations of mucin as low as 35 micrograms/ml. Ocular mucin was the only material tested that inhibited adherence of P. aeruginosa to an injured cornea. However, the binding of P. aeruginosa to immobilized substrates in vitro did not predict which fraction would possess antiadherence activity: bacteria bound well to whole ocular mucus, mucin, the nonmucin fraction of ocular mucus, and dilute human tears as well as to porcine stomach mucin and bovine submaxillary gland mucin. The effectiveness of the mucin fraction of ocular mucus at inhibiting the binding of P. aeruginosa to the cornea implies that this material is a barrier that protects the surface of the eye from P. aeruginosa adherence.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657, new rifamycin derivatives.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the new rifamycin derivatives KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were compared with those of rifampin. Rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin were also tested for reference. The respective MICs of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90S) were 0.016 and 0.0078 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.016 and 0.0039 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 0.0625 and 0.016 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. These MIC90S of KRM-1657 were equal to or 2- to 64-fold lower than those of rifampin. KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 with MIC90S of between 0.002 and 0.078 microgram/ml were 2- to 128-fold more active than rifampin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC90S of KRM-1657 for Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.25 and 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively; KRM-1657 was almost as active as rifampin and was 8- to 16-fold more active than KRM-1648 against these strains. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutations to resistance to KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 was equal to that to rifampin. Against systemic infection with S. aureus in mice, the efficacies of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were comparable to that of rifampin.
TI  - Hexachlorophane powder and neonatal staphylococcal infection.
AB  - An outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus infections occurred following discontinuation of antiseptic cord care on a neonatal unit. Multiple phage types were involved. The most common site of infection was the umbilicus. In addition, there were two clusters of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection and one due to Streptococcus pyogenes. The outbreak was rapidly controlled by the reintroduction of hexachlorophane powder for cord care.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in pediatric field].
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) granules, a new oral cephem, was given to pediatric patients with infectious diseases to evaluate antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and the following results were obtained. 1. In sensitivity test, 30 strains were used comprised of 5 species, isolated from the patients before administered with CDTR-PI. Against Staphylococcus aureus, MICs of 7 agents, cefditoren (CDTR), cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram, cefotiam, cefpodoxime and methicillin, were determined. Against other 4 species, MICs of the above 6 agents excluding methicillin were determined. Among Gram-positive cocci tested, the MICs of CDTR were 0.78 to 100 micrograms/ml or higher against S. aureus (16 strains), < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (5 strains), and 0.10 or 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 strains). These values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems and of methicillin. Among Gram-negative rods tested, the MICs of CDTR were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (3 strains), and 0.10 or 0.20 microgram/ml against Escherichia coli (4 strains). Also, these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems. 2. When CDTR-PI granules was orally administered in a single dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 1 patient and that of 6.0 mg/kg to 2 patients 30 minutes after meal, plasma CDTR concentrations reached their maxima 4 hours after administration in the former patient and 1 or 2 hours after administration in the latter 2 patients, and the peak plasma concentrations were 1.91, 3.46 and 4.82 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 1.01, 0.81 and 0.88 hours and AUCs of 8.62, 9.89 and 13.52 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Dose-dependency was observed for the peak plasma concentrations and AUCs also tended to depend on dose excepting for the AUC in one 6.0 mg/kg patient. 3. The urinary concentrations in the above patients reached their peaks at 4 to 6 hours after administration in one 3.0 mg/kg patient and at 4 to 6 hours and 2 to 4 hours after administration in two 6.0 mg/kg patients, and the corresponding values were 126.0, 195.0 and 234.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Recovery rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 18.2, 24.6 and 21.3%, respectively. 4. Of 53 patients with 13 diseases, CDTR-PI was clinically judged "excellent" in 32 (60.4%) and "good" in 21 (39.6%), showing excellent efficacy. 5. Bacteriologically, excellent results were obtained, i.e., 29 (96.7%) of 30 strains from 5 species were eradicated. 6. Side effects were observed in none of the 54 patients treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from skin infections in 1992 to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We studied the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) isolated from skin infections in 1992. For S. aureus, we measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the following 10 drugs: methicillin (DMPPC), cefaclor (CCL), gentamicin (GM), erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM), minocycline (MINO), vancomycin (VAN), fusidic acid (FA), ofloxacin (OFLX) and nadifloxacin (NDFX); for S. pyogenes, we determined the MICs of the following 9 drugs: ampicillin (ABPC), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR), erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM), minocycline (MINO), norfloxacin (NFLX), of loxacin (OFLX) and nadifloxacin (NDFX). These drugs are frequently used to treat skin infections, either systemically or topically. NDFX is a new synthetic fluoroquinolone, recently developed for use as a topical acne medication in Japan. It is used NDFX for acne, but not for skin infections. There were no strains of S. aureus resistant to NDFX, VAN or FA. The resistance (> or = 12.5 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus was highest to GM and lowest to OFLX. Four strains of methicillin-resistant (> or = 12.5 micrograms/ml) S. aureus (MRSA) were found. In contrast, no resistant strains of S. pyogenes were found except to MINO. Only two strains of S. pyogenes were susceptible to MINO. The sensitivity of S. pyogenes to ABPC, AMPC, CPDX-PR, EM and CLDM was very good. All the strains were susceptible at a MIC below > or = 0.05 microgram/ml. However, the S. pyogenes strains were not very sensitive to the new quinolones, especially NFLX. We concluded that penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides are still effective against streptococcal infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Diagnosis of cellulitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - A prospective microbiological evaluation of cellulitis in 22 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus was performed. Patients with helper lymphocyte counts of less than 200 cells/mm(3) had a greater frequency of positive cultures. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and initial antibiotic therapy should cover these Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - Criteria for the assessment of adverse effects of chemotherapy on the oral microflora.
AB  - Any assessment of an antimicrobial agent for the prevention of dental caries must include a consideration of its possible adverse effects on the oral flora. It must include an examination of the resistance developed by the target pathogens and either developed by, or inherently present in, microorganisms that are known to cause opportunistic infections (yeasts, enteric organisms, Pseudomonas, clostridia, and Staphylococcus aureus). Streptococcus pyogenes should also be included. Insofar as possible, these assessments should be done in preliminary experiments, both in vitro and clinical, rather than in caries trials, so that the large numbers of subjects will not be submitted to unnecessary exposure to the formulation. It must be recognized that some combinations of agent, vehicle, and frequency are more prone than others to cause adverse effects on the oral flora, and will also influence the length of the test period that should be utilized. The microbial assessments should be done on subjects prior to use of the agent, at appropriate frequencies during therapy, and approximately 2 months after the cessation of therapy. Currently, requirements to assess the state of gingival or periodontal health by microbiological examination seem unjustified, because of the relative lack of strong evidence for their diagnostic or predictive value (Ranney, 1989) and because of the ease with which direct measurements of clinical signs and symptoms can be made. Consequently, only the latter should be required.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Morphological alterations of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes exposed to cefdinir, a new oral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and the morphological alteration  of Staphylococcus aureus 209-P JC and Streptococcus pyogenes C-203 exposed to cefdinir were studied. Although cefdinir was bactericidal against both strains, the extent of the decrease in colony-forming units (CFU) was similar in a fairly wide range of concentrations. Transmission electron microscopy of S. aureus 209-P JC revealed that cefdinir induced thickening of the cross wall and frequent cell lysis at low concentrations. The lytic sites were seen at the site of septum formation. In S. pyogenes C-203, cefdinir induced thickening of the peripheral wall and cross wall, and protoplast-like cells were observed during the incubation period. Cefdinir showed high affinity for all PBPs of S. aureus 209-P JC and S. pyogenes C-203. The drastic changes in the morphology of S. aureus and S. pyogenes were caused by binding of cefdinir to all PBPs.
TI  - The type I macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host defense functions. Using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type I bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most Gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to Gram-positive bacteria. Lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to Gram-positive bacteria. Scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during Gram-positive sepsis. Since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: a classification of necrotizing soft tissue infections.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, often fatal soft tissue infection. It still remains a confusing entity because of the nomenclature and multiple subtypes described in the past. An interesting case study of a patient with necrotizing fasciitis secondary to nonclostridial gas gangrene is presented. A comprehensive review of necrotizing fasciitis, its disease process and treatment modalities will be discussed.
TI  - Immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - We have investigated the local immune response of the BALB/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. After two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgM, and IgA) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. The procedure followed the principle of the classical ELISPOT test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (Eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. Lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific IgA synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas IgG and IgM production rates showed no remarkable differences. In addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific IgA titers but not increased IgM and IgG levels. We conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced IgA response in a distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.
TI  - Penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  - Recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. Failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. These organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and H parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Fusobacterium sp, and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect GABHS in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. Numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent GABHS tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both GABHS and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Comparison of antibody activity against various microorganisms in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations determined by ELISA and opsonic assay.
AB  - In the present study the level of antimicrobial antibodies and the phagocytosis-promoting activity in immunoglobulin preparations produced for intravenous use were assessed. The level of antibodies directed against various microorganisms in six immunoglobulin preparations was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and was shown to be either equal to or higher than that of pooled normal human serum. All preparations were able to promote phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli K12, and Streptococcus pyogenes by human granulocytes. Substantial differences among the various preparations in antibody activity were noted. In particular, Intraglobulin, chemically modified by beta-propiolactone treatment, exhibited little activity in both the ELISA and the phagocytosis assay. In contrast, IVIG SRC, Gamimmune, Sandoglobulin (treated at low pH in presence or absence of trace amounts of pepsin), and Gammagard (treated by ion-exchange chromatography) showed good activity in both assays. Comparison of the results of the ELISA and phagocytosis assay for the various preparations indicated a good correlation except for S. aureus with a moderate (strain 42D) or high (strain Cowan I) protein A content. These data indicate that the antibody activity of immunoglobulin preparations against various microorganisms determined by ELISA can be used to predict their opsonic activity.
TI  - Nutritional profile and antimicrobial spectrum of the spice Aframomum danielli K. Schum.
AB  - The spice, Aframomum danielli, on a wet weight basis with a moisture content of 10.5%, protein content of 8.2% (dry matter basis) and caloric value of 469.7 kcal/100 g, contains in varying amounts, minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and copper. Amino acids found in varying concentrations in A. danielli include L-Threonine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-Glutamic acid, glycine, L-Leucine and L-Lysine. Using minimum inhibition zone of 20-22 mm in diameter, A. danielli inhibited the growth of Salmonella enteriditis, Psudomonas fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. ochraceus and A. niger. The minimum concentration (MIC) determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 in 320 whilst the MIC for S. aureus was 1 in 8,000.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefditoren pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies were performed in pediatrics on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) in granules. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of CDTR after administration of CDTR-PI to children (ages between 1 and 10) were investigated. Five cases were administrated with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 3 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations in these cases reached their peaks at 2 hours after administration with an average level of 1.23 +/- 0.34 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.04 +/- 0.04 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.60 +/- 0.38 hours. Urinary recovery rates of CDTR in the first 8 hours after administration of CDTR-PI averaged 14.9 +/- 0.9%. Five cases were administered with CDTR-PI at a dose level of 6 mg/kg 30 minutes after meal. Serum concentrations with the drug after meal reached their peaks at 1 hour after administration with an average level of 2.62 +/- 0.42 micrograms/ml and diminished to 0.21 +/- 0.11 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after administration with a half-life of 1.58 +/- 0.31 hours. Urinary recovery rates of CDTR in the first 8 hours after administration of CDTR-PI averaged 17.0 +/- 0.7%. These data also showed that serum and urinary concentrations of the drug depended on dose levels. 2. CDTR-PI was administered to 31 pediatric patients (their ages ranged between 1 year and 10 years) with various infections, and clinical and bacteriological effects and adverse reactions were investigated. Clinical effects were evaluable in 24 cases including 2 cases of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute pharyngitis, 12 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 5 cases of acute pneumonia. Clinical responses were excellent in 16 cases, effective in 8 cases, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Antimicrobial effects against a total of 16 strains identified or assumed to be pathogenic bacteria were evaluated. The 16 strains of bacteria included 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. All the bacteria listed here were judged to have been eradicated except 2 strains of H. influenzae (1 was decreased and 1 was unchanged) thus, the eradication rate was 87.5%. Two strains of bacteria replaced infection causing bacteria. Streptococcus pneumoniae replaced S. pyogenes and S. aureus replaced H. influenzae. No adverse side reactions were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Incurable bacterial skin infection].
AB  - The most dominant species isolated from bacterial skin infection is always Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The frequency of isolation of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has recently been increasing in skin infections. MRSA is resistant to many kinds of antibiotics, therefore, MRSA infections is incurable, in many cases. MRSA are isolated most often from infectious decubitus or leg ulcers, in compromised hosts. S. aureus is etiologically related to atopic dermatitis. Simultaneously with S. aureus, there is a increasing frequency of isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in atopic dermatitis. S. pyogenes infections are much more severe because patients infected with S. pyogenes have fever and/or concurrent kidney disorders. In these skin disorders, there is severe skin damage or defect, so that, it may be very difficult to eradicate MRSA in decubitus, ulcers and S. pyogenes in atopic dermatitis.

TI  - Lipoteichoic acid induces secretion of interleukin-8 from human blood monocytes:  a cellular and molecular analysis.
AB  - Invasion by gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial organisms is characterized  immunopathologically by the activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells, leading to the elaboration of macrophage-derived regulatory and chemotactic factors, and the resultant influx of inflammatory leukocytes. Little is known regarding the mechanisms by which gram-positive organisms initiate macrophage activation and subsequent inflammation. In this investigation, we postulated that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) purified from two different gram-positive bacterial species was an important signal for the expression of chemotactic cytokines from human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). In initial experiments, we demonstrated that cell-associated interleukin-8 (IL-8) was expressed by mononuclear phagocytes present in inflamed areas of endocardium in cases of acute Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. We next demonstrated that LTA purified from either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes induced the time- and dose-dependent expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein from human PBM. The expression of IL-8 mRNA from LTA- but not lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PBM was superinduced by concomitant treatment with cycloheximide, indicating that the expression of IL-8 mRNA from LTA-treated PBM was negatively controlled by repressor proteins. Furthermore, mRNA stability studies indicated that IL-8 mRNA was less stable in the presence of LTA than in the presence of LPS. Our findings indicate that LTA can induce the secretion of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotactic factor IL-8 and that LTA may be an important cellular mediator of inflammatory cell recruitment that characterizes immune responses to gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - Superantigens.
AB  - "Superantigens" is the term for a group of molecules that have in common an extremely potent stimulatory activity for T lymphocytes of several species. They stimulate CD4+, CD8+ and gamma delta + T cells by a unique mechanism: they cross-link variable parts of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with MHC class II molecules on accessory or target cells. The interaction site on the class II molecule and on the TCR is different from the peptide binding site; on the TCR it is the variable part of the beta chain (V beta). The prototype superantigen is the staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), member of a family of genetically related proteins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These are soluble exotoxins of approximately 27 kd molecular mass. It is intriguing that this molecular mechanism of T-cell stimulation has been independently produced at least three times in evolution. Other pathogens producing superantigens are retroviruses (the Mouse Mammary Tumor Viruses) and a mycoplasma (Mycoplasma arthritidis). Many additional candidate superantigens have been proposed, but in most cases unequivocal evidence for superantigen activity is still missing. There are several reasons why these molecules have aroused such tremendous interest in recent years. First, they have provided key information on tolerance mechanisms, both on the deletion of T cells in the thymus and on the induction of peripheral tolerance by anergy and apoptosis. Second, of all polyclonal T-cell stimulators they are the ones that most closely mimic the recognition of specific antigen. Finally, they have been recognized as important factors in the pathogenicity of the producing pathogens, inducing shock and immunosuppression. Whilst there is evidence that superantigens could be involved in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases, in most cases this is still very preliminary and indirect.
TI  - Bacterial resistance in eastern Europe--selected problems.
AB  - The profile of infection and pattern of bacterial resistance in Eastern Europe is distinct from that observed in other parts of the world. Several Polish investigations have reported that environmental pollution may increase the risk of respiratory disease. Studies from Hungary and Romania have documented a dramatic increase in the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. In comparison, resistance to these agents amongst Polish pneumococci isolates is lower, although these pathogens and Streptococcus pyogenes have displayed increasing tetracycline resistance. 20% of Polish Haemophilus influenzae isolates and a high percentage of Moraxella catarrhalis strains exhibit ampicillin resistance. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been found to constitute 22% of Polish S. aureus strains. Two major clones of MRSA have been identified in Poland which differ in their degree of antimicrobial resistance. The pattern of antimicrobial resistance amongst Polish respiratory pathogens is undoubtedly a reflection of management policies and the use of these drugs. It is hoped that the economic and political changes taking place within Eastern Europe will provide the information and resources to establish more efficient infection control and antibiotic policy and thus delay and limit the appearance of bacterial resistance.
TI  - [Therapy of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in lactating dairy cows using intra-mammary Sulphamycin (Polfa, PR)].
AB  - Sulphamycin (Polfa, Poland) is an intramammary preparation for the treatment of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in dairy cows. Its effects were observed in 141 dairy cows treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The animals were selected after clinical examination of the mammary gland and bacteriological examination of udder secreta. In 37 subclinically diseased cows the efficiency of treatment depended on the infectious agent and amounted to 85.2, 77.8, 73.3 and 60.0%, Streptococcus agalactiae beta-haemolytical Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium pyogenes being the respective pathogens. In 61 cows with acute mastitis the efficiency of the preparation reached 71.2, 78.3, 61.7 and 80.9% in the cases induced by S. agalactiae, beta-haemolytical Streptococci, S. aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Forty-three cows were treated for acute mastitis and concomitant alteration of the general health state; in these cases, S. agalactiae, S. aureus and E. coli were identified as the infectious agents and the respective therapeutic efficiency presented 62.5, 69.8 and 76.2%. S. agalactiae and beta-haemolytical Streptococci responded most sensitively to erythromycin whereas S. aureus and E. coli proved to be septrin- and streptomycin-sensitive, respectively.
TI  - Superantigens produced by infectious pathogens: molecular mechanism of action and biological significance.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Rabbit CAP18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kDa) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of Re-lipopolysaccharide coated erythrocytes. The C-terminal 37 amino acids of CAP18 comprise the LPS-binding domain called RNIP, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. Synthetic RNIP has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [IC50 = 130-200 nM] and gram negative bacteria [IC50 = 20-100 nM). Susceptible strains include Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. Although a 32 amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the C terminus of RNIP is highly active, other fragments of RNIP including truncation of its N-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins RNIP is active in serum. RNIP or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus in Kawasaki syndrome.
AB  - Kawasaki syndrome (KS), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in peripheral blood. Our study suggests that KS may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. Bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute KS and 15 controls. Bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 KS patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) secreting Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (SPE) B and C were found in the other 2. These toxins are known to stimulate V beta 2+ T cells. All TSST-producing KS isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. S aureus isolates from acute KS patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). S aureus colonies from KS patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-KS isolates were gold. These observations suggest that the expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in most patients with KS may be caused by a new clone of TSST-producing S aureus, and, in a minority of patients, SPEB-producing or SPEC-producing streptococci.
TI  - Staphylococcal and streptococcal pyodermas.
AB  - The pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy of the common pyodermas, those caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, are reviewed.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of selected lozenges.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of 10 lozenges (Merothol, Merocets, Merocaine, Strepsils (two varieties), Dequacaine, Dequacets, Zensyls, Tyrozets, and Labosept) were determined by use of a microtiter counting method with Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans as the test organisms. Merothol, Merocets, Merocaine, and both Strepsils formulations all reduced the counts of both S. aureus and S. pyogenes suspensions by approximately 6 log cycles within 5 and 20 min, respectively. Merothol, Merocets, and Merocaine also caused a reduction in the counts of the C. albicans suspension approximately 5 log cycles within 40 min, but no other lozenge formulation showed rapid and marked activity against C. albicans. Dequacaine and Dequacets showed marked but much slower activities against this yeast. Zensyls caused an approximately 6-log-cycle reduction in bacterial counts within 40 min, and Dequacaine, Dequacets, and Tyrozets showed marked but slower antibacterial activities. This work confirmed by a statistically sound in vitro method the in vivo antibacterial activities reported for Merothol, Merocets, and Merocaine, demonstrated equivalent antibacterial activities for Strepsils, and indicated that Merothol, Merocets, and Merocaine also showed marked activities against C. albicans.
TI  - Bacterial flora in patients presenting with sore throat in Dutch general practice.
AB  - The bacterial growth in patients presenting with a sore throat was assayed and four clinical features were tested in order to reliably differentiate between beta-haemolytic streptococci group A (GABHS) and other micro-organisms. For 2 years, 53 general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands took throat swabs from all patients, aged 4-60, presenting with a sore throat lasting 14 days or less. Four clinical features: fever (history), (tonsillary) exudate, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy and absence of cough were registered. In 70% of the 598 patients one or more micro-organisms were cultured from throat specimens. In 48% of the patients beta-haemolytic streptococci were found (32% group A, 7% group C, 4% group G, 5% others). Enterobacteriaceae were cultured in 5%, Candida albicans in 5%, Staphylococcus aureus in 4%, various others in 8% of the patients. In 30% of the patients cultures remained negative. Of the 270 patients with three or four clinical features, 46% (95% Cl, 40-52%) harboured GABHS in their throats, while in 328 patients with less than three features 21% (95% Cl, 16-25%) were GABHS positive. However, this relationship between presence or absence of clinical features and culture result was not found in the youngest age category (4-14 years old). Culture results were not related to sex, smoking habits or the insurance mode of the patient. The clinical relevance of several micro-organisms, other than beta-haemolytic streptococci, remains to be determined. The four mentioned signs and symptoms were helpful in predicting the probability of GABHS in patients aged 15 years and older.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of scrubbing and irrigation on staphylococcal and streptococcal counts in  contaminated lacerations.
AB  - We studied the effects of scrubbing with poloxamer 188 (SCR), irrigating with povidone iodine (PI), and scrubbing followed by irrigation (SCR-PI) on staphylococcal and streptococcal counts in inoculated guinea pig lacerations. PI irrigation and SCR-PI significantly lowered streptococcal counts (P < 0.05). Staphylococcal counts were not different from those in controls.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on S-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  - S-1108 is a new oral esterified cephem antibiotic. Its active form, S-1006, has a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, S-1006 is extremely stable against beta-lactamases with some exceptions. In the present study, we conducted laboratory and clinical evaluations of S-1108 granules in pediatrics. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. A drug sensitivity test revealed that MIC80 of the drug against 456 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus that had been kept in our laboratory was 6.25 micrograms/ml, similar to those of cefaclor (CCL) and methicillin (DMPPC). The most frequent MIC was 1.56 micrograms/ml against 20 strains of S. aureus isolated from patients who received this drug, and this value was similar to those for CCL, amoxicillin (AMPC) and DMPPC. As regards to Streptococcus pyogenes, MIC of S-1006 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against 449 clinical isolates in our culture collection and 7 strains obtained from patients who received this drug, and these MICs are similar to those of cefteram (CFTM). MICs of S-1006 against 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from patients who received this drug were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml, 0.10 microgram/ml or 0.39 microgram/ml which are similar to those of CFTM. MICs of S-1006 against 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae obtained from patients who received this drug were 0.05 or 0.10 microgram/ml which are similar to those of CFTM. 2. When S-1108 granule preparation was administered to 1 patient at 4.0 mg/kg, the peak plasma concentration of S-1006 was 1.25 microgram/ml. S-1108 granule preparation was also administered to 2 patients at 6.0 mg/kg, and the peak plasma concentrations were 2.43 micrograms/ml and 2.23 micrograms/ml. Plasma half-lives were 1.11 hours after 4.0 mg/kg and 1.28 hours in both patients given 6.0 micrograms/ml. AUCs were 4.06, 8.37 and 7.73 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. A dose-response relationship was observed between the two doses. 3. Urinary concentration was the highest during the 4-6-hour period for a patient given 4.0 mg/kg, and during the 0-2-hour or 4-6-hour period for 2 patients given 6.0 mg/kg. The peak concentrations were 258.0, 602.0 and 500.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and urinary recovery rates during the 0-8-hour period were 38.9, 38.3 and 23.1%, respectively. 4. Clinical effects were excellent or good in 88 of 93 patients, showing a very high efficacy rate of 94.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical study of S-1108 fine granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - S-1108 in a fine granular form was administered in 14 children and its safety and efficacy in bacterial infections were evaluated. Among them, 2 cases of cystitis and 1 case of pneumonia were considered unevaluable for the efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 81.8% in the eleven evaluable cases treated with S-1108 fine granules including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 2 cases each of tonsillitis, pertussis and cystitis. 2. Bacteriological efficacy of 100% was achieved against pathogens identified in 5 children including 1 case each of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and 2 cases of Escherichia coli. 3. The only abnormal laboratory test results observed were eosinophilia and leukocytopenia in one case each. Diarrhea was recorded in 1 case. Judging from the above results, it appears that S-1108 in the fine granular form is an effective, useful and safe antibiotic of first choice for the treatment of infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - Molecular evolution of the staphylococcal and streptococcal pyrogenic toxin gene  family.
AB  - The pyrogenic toxin (PT) family is composed of the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), the toxic shock syndrome toxin, and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPE). Whereas considerable effort has focused on characterization of PTs due to their unique biological properties, our understanding of the evolution of this gene family is incomplete. Phylogenetic relationships for members of the PT family were estimated by examining the previously reported nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding SPEA, SPEC, SEA, SEB, SEC1, SEC2, SEC3, SED, and SEE. Additionally, we present and analyze sequence data on seven previously unreported sec genes. Within the PT family, sequence divergence was partitioned in a hierarchical fashion such that mean sequence divergence ranged from 1.179 among all 16 toxin genes, 0.443 among those restricted to Staphylococcus, and 0.028 among the genes encoding 10 variants of Type C SE. Results of this study are interpreted as suggesting that the PT family consists of two large clades. One clade consists of the staphylococcal toxins SEA, SEE, and SED, being closely related to the streptococcal toxin SPEC, whereas the other clade depicts close relationships of the staphylococcal toxins SEC and SEB with the streptococcal toxin SPEA.
TI  - Disinfectant effects of "Taisalite" and "Taifresh Ace" containing Irgasan DP300 against MRSA and HIV.
AB  - Sterilization and disinfection in dental clinics and laboratories are important in controlling disease vectors such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We determined the inactivation of disinfectant effects of "Taisalite" and "Taifresh Ace" containing Irgasan DP300 on MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, and HIV. Exposure for 10 seconds to 50% or 5% Taisalite solution inactivated HIV completely. HIV was also completely inactivated by 10 minutes of exposure to 50% or 5% of Taifresh Ace solution. Taisalite possessed strong bactericidal activity against S. pyogenes and MRSA. C. albicans was resistant to 10 to 30 second exposures to Taisalite. MRSA and C. albicans were killed completely by exposure to 90% Taifresh Ace solution for 10 minutes. S. pyogenes was not highly sensitive to Taifresh Ace. The present study showed that Irgasan DP300 containing Taisalite is an excellent disinfectant against HIV and MRSA and that Taifresh Ace is a useful detergent against these micro-organisms.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were performed in the field pediatrics. The following results were obtained. 1) Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of S-1006, the active form of S-1108, were studied against clinically isolated strains of (Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 3), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 8), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 5) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2). MIC values ranged < or = 0.025-1.56 for GPC and < or = 0.025-0.78 microgram/ml for GNR. 2) Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of S-1108 were measured upon administration of S-1108 after meal at dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), 4 mg/kg (n = 1) and 6 mg/kg (n = 1). The peak blood concentrations of S-1006 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 4), ranged from 0.57 to 1.82 micrograms/ml at 1, 2 and 4 hours after dosing. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters T1/2 and AUC were 1.29 +/- 0.69 hours and 4.47 +/- 2.25 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. At a dose of 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 1.79 and 1.27 micrograms/ml at 2 and 3 hours after treatment. T1/2 and AUC were 1.34 and 1.11 hours, and 8.19 and 5.65 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates ranged from 13.0 to 37.2% for the first 8 hours after administration. 3) Clinical studies Clinical efficacies were examined in 32 cases of various pediatric infections including 5 cases of acute pneumonia, 11 cases of bronchitis, 2 cases of scarlet fever, 8 cases of tonsillitis, 1 case of pharyngitis, 2 cases of otitis media and 3 cases of UTI. Clinical efficacy rate was 96.9% (31/32) and bacteriological eradication rate was 87.1% (27/31). There were no side effects and abnormal laboratory test values except 1 case (Eosino. 2-->10%) in the 32 cases.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Laboratory and Clinical Studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out to evaluate its usefulness at a dose between 2 and 4 mg/kg a day for 7 to 14 days in the pediatric field. 1) Pharmacokinetic studies S-1108 at a dose of 2 mg/kg was administered to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters in 1 subject. Cmax, T1/2 and AUC were 0.69 hour, 1.42 hours and 2.15 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. 2) Antimicrobial activities MICs against various clinically isolated organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae) were determined. The MIC values of S-1006 were similar to those of cefteram, the MICs against S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae were < or = 0.025 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. 3) Clinical studies S-1108 was administered to patients with various pediatrics infections in 34 cases (upper respiratory tract infections: 12 cases, lower respiratory tract infections: 5 cases, urinary tract infections: 9 cases, skin and soft tissue infection: 6 cases, otitis media: 2 cases). Clinical efficacy rate was evaluated according to "Standard of clinical evaluation in pediatrics field". The responses were all good or excellent. 4) Side reactions There were no serious adverse reactions in any cases. The above results suggest that S-1108 is potent effective and safe agent in the pediatric field at a dose between 2-4 mg/kg (t.i.d.) a day.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in children].
AB  - A new oral cephem antibiotic, S-1108, was evaluated for its clinical efficacy and safety in children. S-1108 was effective in 95% of the 59 examined cases of respiratory, middle ear, skin and urinary tract infections. S-1108 was highly effective in infections of Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, but was less effective in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections. The serum half-life was 1.26 +/- 0.36 hours upon after meal administration of 4 mg/kg. No severe adverse reaction was encountered. From these data, S-1108 appears to be safe and effective in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on S-1108 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on S-1108 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 11 patients were treated with S-1108. Each dose was 3 mg/kg, orally administered 3 times daily for 4-14 days. The clinical efficacies of S-1108 in 10 patients with bacterial infections (1 with bacteremia, 4 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 1 with scarlet fever and 2 with streptococcal pharyngitis) were evaluated as excellent in 8 patients and as good in 2 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Only one patient with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) who received gamma-globulin was not evaluated. Fourteen causative strains of 5 species were found in 10 patients. Three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae out of 5, 2 of 3 Branhamella catarrhalis strains, none of Staphylococcus aureus and all 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes were eradicated. No adverse reaction was observed in any of the 11 patients. 2. MICs of S-1108 against 5 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae from cases of infections were examined. All of them were relatively highly resistant to penicillins. S-1108 was compared with cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefaclor and cefixime, and it showed better antibacterial activity or than other cephems. 3. Double peaks were obtained in plasma levels of S-1108 orally administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg at 30 minutes after meal and were 1.03 microgram/ml and 0.74 microgram/ml at 1 and 4 hours after administration, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in pediatric field].
AB  - Nine pediatric patients with bacterial infections (5 cases of tonsillitis, 3 cases of impetigo and 1 case of UTI) were treated with S-1108, and the efficacy and the safety were evaluated. The clinical responses to S-1108 treatment were excellent in 7 cases and good in 2. The efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriologically, the causative organisms (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Escherichia coli) were eradicated. No clinical side effects were observed. Elevation of CK in 2 cases and eosinophilia in 1 case were noted.
TI  - Induction of the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by Bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  - The presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. The importance, however, of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of B. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Prostaglandin E2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the cAMP-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. Of the bacterial species tested, B. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin E2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome. Are you recognizing its changing presentations?
AB  - Nonmenstrual cases of toxic shock syndrome now occur at least as often as the classic menstrual cases. The syndrome has been reported in every conceivable clinical setting involving colonization or infection with Staphylococcus aureus and as a complication of surgical procedures, traumatic injuries, and local infections. Unusual clinical manifestations have been observed in patients with AIDS. Cases of toxic shock syndrome also have been linked to infection with toxin-producing strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and group A streptococci. Knowledge of the expanding spectrum of toxic shock syndrome and early consideration of the disease in patients with fever, hypotension, rash, and/or multisystem disease are essential for timely diagnosis and optimum management.
TI  - Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - The electrified drain. A new device for sterilizing the field of drainage.
AB  - A randomized control study was performed on 24 patients to evaluate the effect of a new drainage system. Two types of drains were used: electrified and the conventional corrugated rubber drains. All of the 24 patients had an incisional hernia repair operation. In 12 patients, the wound was drained with an electrified drain (ED) and in the other 12 by the conventional drain (CD). The ED consisted of a corrugated rubber drain to which 2 silver-silver chloride electrodes were fixed. The wounds were drained for the first 3 post-operative days during which antibiotics were given. A peroperative and daily swab from the wound was taken during the time of drainage and for 4 days thereafter, and cultured. For evaluation, a pathogen count of less than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml of discharge from wound cultures was considered as successful drainage, while counts above this level were defined as failures. Drainage failure occurred in 4/12 patients (33%) of the CD group. Pathogens encountered were Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and albus and P. aeruginosa. Manifestations of wound inflammation occurred in 2 of the 4 patients. The appropriate antibiotic was given to the 4 patients after culture and sensitivity tests were performed. Drainage failure did not occur in any of the ED group. Post-operative laboratory assessment of blood count, liver and kidney functions and serum electrolytes recorded insignificant changes against preoperative values in both groups. The results demonstrate the superiority of the ED over the CD. The electric field produced by the ED seems to be lethal to organisms. The ED is simple, safe and cost-effective.
TI  - Effect of specific bacteria on lymphocyte proliferation in diseased and nondiseased tonsils.
AB  - Tonsillar tissue lymphocyte (TTL) function as measured by lymphocyte proliferation was assessed in vitro in 38 tonsils--30 diseased and 8 normal controls. TTLs from diseased and control tonsils were challenged with intact, heat-inactivated bacteria which may be found in the core of diseased tonsils; these bacteria were Streptococcus pyogenes and Hemophilus influenzae type B (HIB), as well as the dominant bacterium (DB) grown from that particular tonsillar core. The phytomitogen leukoagglutinin (LA) was used as a nonspecific activator. Lymphocyte proliferation was quantified and reported using a stimulation index (SI) which was based upon viable cell counts at 2, 4, and 6 days following inoculation. Overall, the greatest degree of lymphocyte proliferation in diseased TTLs (SI = .91) was produced by HIB. However, both SP and HIB produced more lymphocyte proliferation in the nondiseased TTLs than in the diseased TTLs (P < .01). H influenzae (non-B) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were the pathogens most frequently cultured as the dominant bacteria from the core of diseased tonsils; Streptococcus viridans was most frequently cultured in nondiseased tonsils. The DB caused greater TTL proliferation in diseased (SI = .89) versus control (SI = .63) TTLs (P < .001). These findings suggest a differential proliferative response in vitro for diseased and nondiseased TTLs in response to specific bacteria. The role of possibly pathogenic bacteria and commensals, as well as the implications for clinical disease, are discussed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - Adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in Yaounde, Cameroon.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. Bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. Other etiologies were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Moraxella catarrhails (1). Patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. There were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. The causative agents in patients with failures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. Only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. Side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a mild skin rash. Due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.
TI  - Mutations affecting MHC class II binding of the superantigen streptococcal erythrogenic toxin A.
AB  - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) is an important pathogenicity factor of group A streptococci. It is a member of the family of 'superantigens' produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and its T lymphocyte stimulating activity is involved in the pathogenesis of certain diseases caused by pyogenic streptococci. In this study we have generated nine mutant SPEA molecules by substituting amino acids in the regions of homology between different streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens. An additional mutant was created by deletion of the 10 N-terminal amino acids. The mutants were expressed as fusion proteins. Several mutations led to a loss of function due to a loss of class II-binding activity. Such loss mutations did not cluster to a certain region of the SPEA molecule. Rather, even a substitution of neighboring amino acids had opposite effects. None of the loss mutations affected the binding of neutralizing mAb and all loss mutants could be precipitated in Ouchterlony tests by a polyclonal anti-SPEA serum. We conclude that the functional activities of SPEA, and probably of other superantigens as well, cannot be attributed to a defined region of the molecule.
TI  - A novel superantigen isolated from pathogenic strains of Streptococcus pyogenes with aminoterminal homology to staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) has re-emerged in recent years as  a cause of severe human disease. Because extracellular products are involved in streptococcal pathogenesis, we explored the possibility that a disease isolate expresses an uncharacterized superantigen. We screened culture supernatants for superantigen activity with a major histocompatibility complex class II-dependent T cell proliferation assay. Initial fractionation with red dye A chromatography indicated production of a class II-dependent T cell mitogen by a toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) strain. The amino terminus of the purified streptococcal superantigen was more homologous to the amino termini of staphylococcal enterotoxins B, C1, and C3 (SEB, SEC1, and SEC3), than to those of pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, C or other streptococcal toxins. The molecule, designated SSA, had the same pattern of class II isotype usage as SEB in T cell proliferation assays. However, it differed in its pattern of human T cell activation, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with V beta-specific primers. SSA activated human T cells that express V beta 1, 3, 15 with a minor increase of V beta 5.2-bearing cells, whereas SEB activated V beta 3, 12, 15, and 17-bearing T cells. Immunoblot analysis of 75 disease isolates from several localities detected SSA production only in group A streptococci, and found that SSA is apparently confined to only three clonal lineages as defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis typing. Isolates of one of these lineages, (electrophoretic type 2) are strongly associated with TSLS. The data identify SSA as a novel streptococcal superantigen that appears to be more related structurally to staphylococcal enterotoxins than to streptococcal exotoxins. Because abundant SSA production is apparently confined to only three streptococcal clonal lineages, the data also suggest that the SSA gene has only recently been acquired by S. pyogenes.

TI  - [Clinical studies of cefditoren pivoxil in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) in granules. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with CDTR-PI was made for 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections: 4 cases of tonsillitis, 2 cases of pneumonia, 3 cases of scarlet fever, 3 cases of impetigo, 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and 1 case of urinary tract infection. Results obtained were excellent in 12 cases, good in 1 case and poor in 1 case. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefditoren pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) in granules, a new oral cephalosporin, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities: Antibacterial activities of CDTR were studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in comparison with those of cefteram (CFTM), cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and cefotiam (CTM). MIC80's of CDTR against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and B. catarrhalis were 1.56, 0.39, < or = 0.025, < or = 0.025, 0.05 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results showed that CDTR has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. 2. Absorption and excretion: Serum concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CDTR-PI (administered in granules) were determined. Upon single oral doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, the peak serum concentrations were 0.5-2.45 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.79-4.05 micrograms/ml at 1 to 4 hours, respectively, and T 1/2 was 1.07-9.67 hours and 0.99-3.00 hours, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, serum concentrations were 0-0.87 micrograms/ml with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 0.27-0.73 micrograms/ml with 6 mg/kg. These values indicated that the drug has a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic behavior. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours were 12.9-34.2% with a dose of 3 mg/kg and 11.8-26.9% with 6 mg/kg. 3. Clinical study: Clinical efficacies were examined in a total of 81 cases consisting of 20 cases of acute bronchitis, 13 of acute pneumonia, 21 of tonsillitis, 5 of pharyngitis, 7 of scarlet fever, 2 each of impetigo, otitis media and purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 1 of pertussis and 8 of UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 97.5% (79/81), and bacteriological eradication rate was 100% (76/76). As for side effects, 2 cases of watery stools and 1 case of minor elevation of GPT were observed.
TI  - [A clinical study on cefditoren pivoxil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - The clinical efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) was evaluated in 45 patients with various infections. CDTR-PI was administered after meals at a dose of 3 mg/kg t.i.d. to most patients. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.3%. As side effects, diarrhea occurred in 2 patients. Cefditoren showed excellent antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus than other cephems.
TI  - Group B streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: report of a case and purification of an associated pyrogenic toxin.
AB  - A patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is described. The patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. Neither Staphylococcus aureus nor group A streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group B streptococci. The group B streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production of TSS toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. However, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. This toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. The purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. When given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused TSS-like symptoms ending in death. Three additional group B streptococcal strains from patients with TSLS were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of skin and soft tissue infection in children.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infection and cutaneous abscesses are common in children. They may be polymicrobial in nature, especially when located proximal to mucous membranes. A general knowledge of the common causative bacterial organisms in these infections enables the physician to empirically institute antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available. This review assesses the number and types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that occur in skin and soft tissue infections in children. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were recovered from infections occurring at all body sites, but predominated in infections of the leg, neck, and hand. Group D streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Prevotella species were isolated mostly from infections of the external genitalia and perirectal areas; pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas and Haemophilus influenzae can be isolated from infections of the head and neck. Management of skin and soft tissue infections in children should include surgical and medical therapy.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. Similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave PAE values with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cell division of Klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear PAE was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. Therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of PAE for 4-quinolones within a species, the response to DNA damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both DNA replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating DNA repair pathways. Thus, in some cases PAEs result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. The PAE of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.
TI  - Selection of dose regimens of azithromycin .
AB  - The unique pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are characterized by high, sustained  tissue concentrations. The concentrations of azithromycin were predicted, following various multiple dose regimens, from concentrations in tonsillar, prostatic, and uterine tissues following single oral doses. Following a five-day treatment regimen (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg on days 2-5), or a three-day regimen (500 mg daily for three days), concentrations of azithromycin in tonsillar tissue, representative of respiratory tract tissues, will continuously be greater than the MICs for key target pathogens (Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus) in infections of the respiratory tract for up to 10 days. Since tissue concentrations above the MICs for infecting organisms were correlated with efficacy in animal models of infection, short treatment regimens consisting of once-daily oral administration of azithromycin should be effective in the treatment of a variety of infections. A single 1 g oral dose will provide concentrations in the uterus and prostate, representing urogenital tissues, above the MIC for Chlamydia trachomatis for approximately 10 days. Thus, this regimen should be effective in the treatment of chlamydial infections of the genital tract.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin versus clarithromycin in the treatment of patients with upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of azithromycin and clarithromycin were compared in an open multicentre study involving 380 adult patients with acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, or acute streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Patients were assigned randomly to receive azithromycin as a single dose of 500 mg daily for three days, or clarithromycin 250 mg bid for ten days. Overall clinical efficacy was found to be similar in each treatment group at day 10-14, with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 95% of azithromycin and 96% of clarithromycin patients. Bacteriological efficacy was also similar, with eradication of the pathogen in 94% and 95% of isolates, respectively, in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups. In otitis media, a satisfactory clinical response was seen in 97% of patients in each treatment group. Azithromycin therapy resulted in a clinical response rate of 93% in sinusitis patients, with bacteriological eradication in 93% of patients. Two patients (who were cured clinically) had persistent pathogens. Similarly, clarithromycin achieved clinical response and bacteriological eradication in 95% and 92% of sinusitis patients, respectively. Pathogens persisted in two patients with clinical cure, and in one case of clinical failure. In pharyngitis or tonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes was eradicated successfully in 95% of patients in both groups, and the clinical success rates were 96% and 97% for azithromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. No case of clinical failure was associated with persistence of S. pyogenes infection. At the follow-up assessment of this diagnosis group, reinfection had occurred in three (8%) azithromycin patients and one (3%) clarithromycin patient, and all but one patient remained asymptomatic. Both drugs were well-tolerated, with 8.4% of patients on azithromycin and 7.4% on clarithromycin reporting adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal. It was concluded that a three-day course of azithromycin was as effective and well-tolerated as a ten-day course of clarithromycin in adults with acute upper respiratory tract infections.
TI  - A comparative study of the efficacy, safety and tolerance of azithromycin, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin in the treatment of children with acute skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - An open, randomized, multicentre study was undertaken to compare a three-day regimen of azithromycin with a seven-day course of dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin in the treatment of 118 children (aged 2-12 years) with clinically diagnosed acute skin and skin-structure infections. Sixty patients received a single daily dose of azithromycin of 10 mg/kg for three days, whilst 58 received a cloxacillin ester: either dicloxacillin (n = 49) at a daily dose of 12.5-25 mg/kg (depending on severity of infection); or flucloxacillin (n = 9) at 250-2000 mg/day (depending on age). Both cloxacillin esters were administered in four divided doses for seven days. Clinical, safety and, where possible, bacteriological assessments were made before therapy and after 3 to 5 and 7 to 10 days of treatment. A successful clinical response (cure and improvement) was recorded in 57 of 59 (97%) of evaluable azithromycin patients, and in 57 of 58 (98%) of cloxacillin ester patients. Eradication of the key pathogens was 31 of 34 (91%) and 34 of 35 (97%) for Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 5 and 4 of 4 for Streptococcus pyogenes in the azithromycin and cloxacillin ester groups, respectively. Both medications were well tolerated, with mild to moderate side-effects (abdominal pain and vomiting) occurring in two patients in each group, and laboratory abnormalities (elevated eosinophil count) in one patient in each group. There were no withdrawals from therapy. The results of this study suggest that azithromycin is as effective and as well tolerated as a cloxacillin ester antibiotic in the treatment of children with acute skin and skin-structure infections.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Monitoring of resistant organisms in man and identification of their origin.
AB  - Information on the epidemiology of bacterial resistance is fragmentary despite an enormous number of publications since the introduction of antibiotics to human medicine, and remains a field of speculation mixed and influenced by fear of the total collapse of antimicrobial chemotherapy by development of resistance (for review see Wiedemann et al., 1986). Bacteria have evolved mechanisms to withstand the attack of antibiotics and, in parallel, mechanisms for the spread of these characters to other bacteria by means of exchange of genetic information. However the development of resistance cannot be generalized. Staphylococcus aureus gained penicillin resistance within a few years after the introduction of this drug, while Streptococcus pyogenes remains 100% susceptible to penicillin, despite of the long use of penicillins in huge quantities. Thus any statement about the development and epidemiology of resistance has to be addressed specifically to a drug, a bacterial species, and a location. Until now there is no identifiable general trend, which would allow us to deduce a general picture or a future development from a limited database. In this paper long term multicentre studies are presented to demonstrate the area of concern for the treatment of human infections. In this context it is of specific interest to try and trace the origin of bacteria which cause infections in humans.
TI  - Isolation of gram-positive rods that resemble but are clearly distinct from Actinomyces pyogenes from mixed wound infections.
AB  - Beginning in 1990, gram-positive rods resembling Actinomyces pyogenes were found  with increasing frequency in mixed cultures from various infectious processes, most of them from patients with otitis, empyema, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. Ribotyping and hybridization showed that these gram-positive rods could be divided into five groups not related to known Actinomyces species. Biochemical markers for reliable differentiation into these groups, however, could not be found. Therefore, naming new species is not warranted unless parameters are discovered that allow identification without DNA hybridization. These gram-positive rods have been isolated only in mixed cultures with anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus "milleri," enterococci, and gram-negative rods. Their exact role in these possibly synergistic infections needs further investigation.
TI  - Superantigen can reactivate bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis.
AB  - Intravenous injection of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) produced by Staphylococcus aureus, can reactivate arthritis in a rat ankle joint that has been previously inflamed by injection of peptidoglycanpolysaccharide polymers isolated from the cell walls of group A streptococci. The severity and chronicity of this renewed arthritis is dose dependent and at higher doses (125 micrograms/kg) a prolonged joint inflammation with pannus formation and marginal erosion of cartilage and bone is induced after a single injection of TSST-1. Only modest synovial hyperplasia is induced in control ankle joints by systemic injection of TSST-1. Another superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin induces a much weaker, acute reactivation of arthritis that resolves by 2 days. Repeated injections of TSST-1 at 7-day intervals give the same undiminished pattern of joint response, but the joint swelling persists at a higher level with each succeeding injection. Cyclosporin A suppresses all phases of the recurrent arthritis, indicating that TSST-1 could be functioning through its property of a superantigen activating T lymphocytes. II-1 receptor antagonist and anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody, which reduce reactivation of arthritis by peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers, have no effect on reactivation by TSST-1. This experimental model provides a means to examine in vivo the possible role of superantigens in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, and to analyze the cellular and molecular pathways induced by this family of microbial products.
TI  - Outbreak of pyogenic abscesses after diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccination.
AB  - Nine children who received diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine from the same vial at a clinic in Colorado developed pyogenic abscesses at the site of injection. Eight abscesses required surgical drainage and five children were hospitalized. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) was cultured from eight wounds and Staphylococcus aureus was also isolated from four. Epidemiologic investigation revealed that within the hour of the first child's vaccination, three children had been diagnosed in the clinic with GAS pharyngitis. GAS recovered from repeat throat swabs from two of these children and the eight case-isolates were all serotype M-12, T-12 and had identical immunoblot patterns on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Laboratory simulation studies demonstrated that GAS can survive for at least 4 days on the external surface of a vaccine vial rubber stopper and contaminate needles inserted through the stopper. Swabbing the stopper with 70% isopropyl alcohol resulted in effective disinfection. To prevent potential contamination meticulous attention to sterile technique is important when withdrawing vaccine from multidose vaccine vials.
TI  - Loracarbef. A review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  - Loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. At low concentrations (< 2 mg/L) in vitro, it inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups B, C and G. Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. At therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. When administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. Loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is administered twice daily. It offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - [Superantigens and antigen recognition of T lymphocytes].
AB  - Superantigens are antigens which can stimulate T cells bound to MHC molecules. The conventional foreign antigens are recognized by the T cell within the MHC peptide binding groove. Superantigens differ from conventional antigens. They bind with high affinity to class II MHC molecules outside the antigen binding groove in the absence of antigen processing. The MHC class II/superantigen complexes on antigen presenting cells trigger the proliferation of T cells expressing the TcR-VB gene products. Superantigens can amplify or suppress immune responses. To date, two main groups of superantigens have been described, namely endogenous and exogenous superantigens. Exogenous superantigens are microbial toxins and other protein products. Endogenous superantigens are the products of unlinked genetic loci in mice the best known of which are the murine retroviral gene products. Toxins of S. aureus and S. pyogenes are the best known exogenous superantigens, implicated in Toxic Shock Syndrome.
TI  - [Antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate used as a tissue  adhesive].
AB  - In this study, the antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of a synthetic tissue adhesive called n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) which provide rapid healing in incision in oral surgical procedures were investigated. The antibacterial effects of Histoacryl were tested by using standard reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus grown in Mueller-Hinton media (sheep blood supplemented Mueller-Hinton for streptococcus strains) by diffusion technique. The cytotoxic effects were also researched on continuous Vero and primary gingival fibroblast cell cultures by using agar overlay method. In these methods, the inhibition zones produced by Histoacryl were evaluated. As a result, Histoacryl was found to have antibacterial effect on the tested bacteria and produce cytotoxic and cytopathic effects on the tested cell cultures.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of NM394, the active form of prodrug NM441, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of NM394 was compared with those of other new quinolones. NM394 showed potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against 2,606 recent clinical isolates. The activity of NM394 against gram-positive bacteria was 2- to 16-fold less than that of tosulfoxacin and sparfloxacin but was comparable to that of ofloxacin. Only against Streptococcus pyogenes was the activity of NM394 equal to that of sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, NM394 showed antibacterial activity equal to that of ciprofloxacin. Against quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (norfloxacin MIC, > 6.25 micrograms/ml), the activity of NM394 was greater than those of the other agents tested. NM394 was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations near the MIC. NM394 inhibited supercoiling activities of DNA gyrase purified from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa; the 50% inhibitory concentrations were 18.0, 0.41, and 2.05 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens (ETA, SEB): presentation by human  epidermal cells and induction of autologous T cell proliferation in vitro.
AB  - Streptococcal and staphylococcal toxins are responsible for skin-related clinical conditions, e.g. scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome. Skin involvement may result from a hypersensitivity reaction to these toxins; however, their precise mode of action has still to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the capacity of human epidermal cells to present streptococcal erythrogenic toxin A (ETA) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) to autologous T-lymphocytes in vitro. We found a significant T-lymphocyte proliferation response to minute amounts of ETA (p < 0.01) and SEB (p < 0.02) when co-cultured with freshly isolated autologous human epidermal cells. We suggest that human skin may serve not only as an entry for microbial toxin-producing strains but also as an important target for streptococcal and staphylococcal toxin-binding and subsequent T cell proliferation.
TI  - Bacterial infection complicating varicella infection: A 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  - An increased incidence of Streptococci pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) infections and rheumatic fever has been reported over the past decade. The present study was conducted to determine whether a similar increase in such infections was observed after varicella, an infection previously shown to be associated with a high incidence of streptococcal infections. The charts of all children admitted with chickenpox to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1989 were reviewed. Immunocompromised children and those hospitalized for another reason who had an incidental diagnosis of chickenpox were excluded. Twenty-five cases with bacterial infection complicating chickenpox were compared with 103 patients without secondary infection. No statistically significant differences were observed for age, gender, duration of illness prior to hospitalization or duration of hospitalization in the two groups. GAS was the most frequent isolate in the cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The types of infection were significantly different for GAS compared with other organisms, with a predominance of skin infections in the former group (chi(2) analysis, P<0.05). No increase in the incidence of GAS infections was observed over time. This study confirms the importance of GAS infections in patients with varicella, but no increase was observed in hospitalized children during the 10-year study period.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and Streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin A modulate inflammatory mediator release from human neutrophils.
AB  - We studied the influence of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and streptococcal erythrogenic (pyrogenic) toxin A (ETA) on intact and digitonin-permeabilized human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). As was shown by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 or ETA alone, in the absence of any additional stimulus, did not induce the generation of the chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) from PMNs in a wide range of concentrations. In addition, pretreatment of intact PMNs with either toxin potentiated formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)- and washed Staphylococcus aureus cell-induced generation of LTB4 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This increase included LTB4 as well as its inactive omega-oxidated compounds. Further studies revealed evidence that toxin exposure was accompanied by enhanced cellular receptor expression for fMLP as well as for LTB4. The intrinsic GTPase activity of membrane fractions was modulated by both toxins. Short-term incubation with ETA increased the GTPase activity of PMNs up to 141%. Inhibitory effects were obtained when GTP-binding protein functions were stimulated with sodium fluoride (NaF). In addition, specific binding of Gpp(NH)p to GTP-binding protein was inhibited by both toxins during the first 10 min of incubation and was restored at later times of incubation. Our data therefore suggest that both toxins significantly affect the signal transduction pathways of human PMNs, which results in immunomodulatory functions.
TI  - A severe puerperal group A streptococcal infection causing a toxic shock-like syndrome.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is classically associated with vaginal recovery of Staphylococcus aureus during menses. In this case a patient presented with fever, rash, abdominal pain and signs of shock, 6 days postpartum. Blood cultures were negative but endometrial cultures were positive for Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. This case presents a toxic shock-like syndrome due to streptococcus, (toxic streptococcus syndrome) and points out the importance of culturing these patients for organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of miocamycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin on Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The 16-membered macrolide miocamycin (MOM) has been compared with the 14-membered compounds erythromycin and roxithromycin in terms of causing post-antibiotic effects (PAE). Five strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 S. agalactiae and 3 enterococci, of differing phenotypes of resistance to erythromycin, were tested. PAE were measured follwonig exposure of cocci to 1 x, 3 x and 10 x MICs of each antibiotic. Against the staphylococci and group A streptococci the three macrolides gave similar results, PAE of 1- h at 1 x MIC, 2-4 h at 3 x MIC and > 4 h at 10 x MIC being observed. For group B streptococci and the only erythromycin-sensitive enterococcus tested, PAE due to MOM were at least double those due to erythromycin or roxithromycin, at each concentration tested. MOM produced significant PAE for the strains that were inducibly resistant to erythromycin and roxithromycin.
TI  - Probable role of Streptococcus pyogenes in Kawasaki disease.
AB  - Over the past 25 years, the clinical course of Kawasaki disease has been defined, the prevalence and nature of the cardiovascular effects widely understood, and pathological changes in the most severe cases well described. However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this puzzling disease have remained unclear, thus specific therapy is not yet available. Because of some close clinical similarities between this disease and streptococcal scarlet fever, particular attention has been paid to the possible role of Streptococcus pyogenes as an aetiological agent in this illness. Until now, however, group A beta-haemolytic streptococci have never been consistently isolated from any patients; in addition, the titre of anti-streptolysin 0 is not raised, and lack of response to antibiotics is a feature of this disease. Our long series of investigations over more than 10 years, which will be covered in the present review, were performed in an attempt at elucidating causative agent(s) of Kawasaki disease. This has led to our firm belief in the probable role of S. pyogenes in the pathogenesis of this disease, despite the lack of fulfillment of Koch's postulates, on the basis of the following findings. Patients with Kawasaki disease recovering from the acute, febrile phase of the illness exhibited an exaggerated cell-mediated reactivity, as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test, to group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, their pyrogenic exotoxin and streptolysin 0 as well as to several mammalian muscle cell extracts which are allegedly related antigenically to the cell wall and/or cytoplasmic membrane of S. pyogenes. Protoplast-like "spherical bodies" varying in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 microns, and devoid of cell walls, were detected in the buffy coats of peripheral blood from patients with this disease, and stained distinctly by immuno-electron microscopy using, as a primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum to S. pyogenes- derived protoplasts, and followed by absorption with protoplasts from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Newborn mice infected with S. pyogenes having no capacity to confer cell-mediated immunity even in adult murine hosts, and reinfected 4-6 weeks later with another strain of the same species of bacteria which is able to elicit cellular immunity, showed a lack of humoral response to streptococcal antigens, leaving intact cell-mediated immunity. Such a biased immunological characteristic is an exact counterpart of that of Kawasaki disease patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - The potential role of bacterial toxins in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
AB  - Toxigenic bacteria have been implicated in some cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although there is not much evidence that Clostridia spp. are associated with SIDS in Britain, strains of Staphylococcus aureus producing pyrogenic toxins have been isolated from significant numbers of these infants at autopsy The pyrogenic toxins, produced by some strains of group A Streptococcus pyogenes as well as staphylococci, are powerful "superantigens" that have significant physiological effects including induction of fever > 38 degrees C. In this article, interactions between genetic and environmental factors that might enhance colonization of epithelial surfaces by toxigenic staphylococci are analyzed: infant's expression of Lewis(a) antigen which acts as a receptor for some microorganisms; viral infections; the effect of mother's smoking on susceptibility to respiratory infection. Based on epidemiological findings and laboratory investigations, a hypothesis is proposed to explain how bacteria producing pyrogenic toxins might contribute to some cot deaths.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - Global surveillance of bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor: 1988-1990.
AB  - In vitro data on bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor were collected from clinical trials conducted in 15 European countries, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. Among the respiratory pathogens, 94% of Haemophilus influenzae, 98.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 98.8% of Streptococcus pyogenes, and 98.1% of Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to cefaclor. Over 90% of the tested isolates of the most common urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli, were susceptible to cefaclor. Virtually all of the pathogens that may infect skin and soft tissues, S pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains), were cefaclor susceptible. These data confirm that the major pathogens in bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, of the skin and related structures, and of the urinary tract remain susceptible to cefaclor after more than 13 years of widespread clinical use.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of cefadroxil and cephalexin in children and adolescents with pyodermas. Cefadroxil Once Daily Pyoderma Study Group.
AB  - This randomized, multicenter study compared the safety and efficacy of cefadroxil with that of cephalexin for the treatment of pyodermas in children and adolescents (1-18 years of age). Cefadroxil was given as a single oral daily dose of 30 mg/kg, and cephalexin 30 mg/kg/day was given in two divided doses. The maximum daily dose for both drugs was 1 gm, and treatment was administered for 10 days. Clinical and bacteriologic evaluations were made on days 4 or 5 during therapy and 2 to 4 days after therapy was completed. Of the 462 patients enrolled in the study, 156 patients in the cefadroxil group and 133 patients in the cephalexin group were evaluable. Staphylococcus aureus (56% of isolates) and Streptococcus pyogenes (39% of isolates) were isolated most frequently. The bacteriologic response was statistically greater in the patients treated with cefadroxil than in those treated with cephalexin (96% versus 89%; P = 0.042). A satisfactory clinical response was reported in 147 (94%) cefadroxil-treated patients and 122 (92%) cephalexin-treated patients (P = 0.476). The overall effective response to treatment was significantly higher with cefadroxil than with cephalexin (94% versus 86%; P = 0.024). Compliance with 9 or 10 days of therapy was similar in both treatment groups, although there was a difference between the two treatment groups with respect to completion of medication regimen: 95% of patients taking cefadroxil once daily--versus 65% of patients taking cephalexin twice daily--took 100% of their medication (P < 0.0001). Adverse events were infrequent and mild. The results of this study demonstrate that once-daily cefadroxil offers greater bacteriologic eradication and a better overall effective response than twice-daily cephalexin for the treatment of pyodermas caused by gram-positive pathogens in children and adolescents.
TI  - Contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. PAE were demonstrated with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. No clear PAE was demonstrated for Klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. In some cases, PAE was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. This is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed DNA repair. S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though K. pneumoniae gave no significant PAE. However, the post-treatment generation times of S. pyogenes, which produced the greatest PAE, gave no evidence of such repair. It is concluded that PAEs may result from a variety of factors.
TI  - Review of cefixime in the treatment of otitis media in infants and children.
AB  - During the past decade there has been an increase in the percentage of resistant  bacteria isolated from middle-ear effusions aspirated from infants and children who have had acute otitis media. At least nine oral antibiotics or combination agents are available for this indication. Cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, has excellent in vitro activity against both beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes but relatively poor activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In children cefixime is similar in effectiveness to amoxicillin and cefaclor, but diarrhea and stool changes are more common with cefixime. Amoxicillin is still preferred for initial empiric treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media. Its major drawback is limited efficacy when beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are the causative organisms. Cefixime is a viable alternative to amoxicillin for infants and children with acute otitis media when: (1) a beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis is isolated from otorrhea or tympanocentesis; (2) the child has a history of delayed hypersensitivity to the penicillins but no history of hypersensitivity to the cephalosporins; (3) there is a high incidence of resistant bacteria in the community; (4) there is not clinical improvement with amoxicillin; or (5) once daily administration is more convenient.
TI  - Microbiologic and clinical aspects of a trial of once daily cefixime compared with twice daily cefaclor for treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children.
AB  - In this randomized, investigator-blinded multicenter study, tympanocentesis for acute otitis media with effusion in 137 ears from 108 children, 6 months to 12 years of age, revealed 84 definite pathogens and 32 potential pathogens. Twenty-nine aspirates from 23 subjects were sterile. Of the 116 isolates 42 (36%) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 24 (21%) were Haemophilus influenzae, 9 (8%) were Moraxella catarrhalis, 9 (8%) were Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 (1%) was Staphylococcus aureus. Twenty-two (19%) definite pathogens produced beta-lactamase. Patients were randomized to cefixime (8 mg/kg/day daily) or cefaclor (40 mg/kg/day divided into two doses). Efficacy was determined by pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry at the end of therapy visit on Days 11 to 14 and up to 4 weeks of follow-up. At end of therapy subjects with definite pathogens exhibited a satisfactory clinical outcome in 26 of 36 (72%) ears for cefaclor and 40 of 48 (83%) ears for cefixime recipients (P = 0.12). For ears with beta-lactamase-producing isolates there were no (0 to 12) cefixime failures but 4 of 10 cefaclor failures (P = 0.03). Diarrhea/loose stools were more frequent in cefixime (16 of 58) than cefaclor (4 of 50) recipients. One cefixime subject required discontinuation of drug. Overall efficacy for treatment of acute otitis media with effusion was not different; however, cefixime appeared more effective for infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Penetration into bone and joint tissues of rabbits and in vitro antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin].
AB  - The penetration of tosufloxacin (TFLX) into the bone and joint tissues of rabbits and its in vitro antibacterial activity were compared with those of lomefloxacin (LFLX) which is a efficacious drug for orthopedic infections. Serum levels of TFLX at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after oral administration (100 mg/kg) were 0.41, 0.65, 0.62 and 0.42 micrograms/ml, respectively. Except in synovial fluid and femur, TFLX concentrations in bone and joint tissues were higher than those in serum (0.69 approximately 1.92 micrograms/g in bone marrow of sternum, 0.55 approximately 1.53 micrograms/g in bone marrow of femur). TFLX concentrations in synovial fluid at 4 and 6 hours after the administration were equal to those in serum, which were lower than those of LFLX, but the ratio of tissue level/serum level of TFLX was similar to that of LFLX. TFLX was 8- to 64-fold more active than LFLX against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, which are major pathogens of purulent osteomyelitis and arthritis. TFLX inhibited the growth of these bacteria at less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. These results indicate that TFLX is a useful drug for orthopedic infection.
TI  - Role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with IgA nephropathy.
AB  - Serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum IgA levels to Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis I and S. pneumoniae were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. The levels of IgG to S. pyogenes T12, S. gordonii and S. sanguis II in patients with IgA nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. Serum immune complexes of IgG and IgA were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. Serum levels of IgA to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of IgA immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. These results suggest that antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - Cefdinir: in vitro activity study and effect of human serum.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefdinir (Cl-983, FK482), an orally absorbed aminothiazole cephalosporin, was compared with that of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefotaxime, vancomycin and erythromycin against 370 clinical isolates of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Cefdinir was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, inhibiting 90% of the strains at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. However, cefdinir was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (range 16- > 128 mg/l). The respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were also susceptible (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/l), but against Enterococcus spp. cefdinir displayed no useful activity. The common members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/l), but those possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases were more resistant (MIC90 2-8 mg/l). The presence of human serum had little effect on MICs of cefdinir. These results indicate that cefdinir exhibited a wide spectrum for an oral cephalosporin and support its possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in infections of the skin, soft tissue, respiratory and urinary tracts.
TI  - Characterization of microbial flora of leprous ulcers infested with maggots.
AB  - Swabs from 64 maggot infested leprosy ulcers before and after treatment for maggots and 100 non-infested leprosy ulcers were studied for the bacterial flora. From maggot infested ulcers (before treatment), the cultures usually showed mixed growth. Among the Gram positive isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (37%), S. albus (18%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (36%) were frequently isolated. Gram negative bacteria isolated were Proteus spp. (21%) and Escherichia coli (7%). Anaerobic bacteria isolated were Micrococcus (3%) and Bacteroides (4%). After treatment of maggot infested ulcers, S. aureus (36%) continued to be isolated with almost the same frequency. The isolates of other Gram negative organisms were slightly reduced. Among the Gram negatives the Proteus spp. (10%) were also less in number. In few cases Neisseria (3%) was found. Anaerobic isolates were M. luteus (2%) and B. necrophorus (3%). From the cases without maggot infestation, a single organism was isolated from 16 cases and 84 mixed cultures were obtained. Isolates included the aerobic Gram positives S. aureus (46%), S. albus (21%) and S. pyogenes (38%), and the Gram negative Proteus spp. (19%) and E. coli (7%). The anaerobic isolate was M. luteus (3%). From this study no apparent association between the type of bacterial flora and maggot infestation could be observed.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin and cefaclor in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin  with that of cefaclor in the treatment of adult secondary bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The study was conducted as a randomized, single-blind comparison. Eighty patients enrolled in the study, of which 74 were evaluable: 37 patients in the lomefloxacin group and 37 in the cefaclor group. Patients received either 400 mg of lomefloxacin orally once daily or 250 mg of cefaclor orally three times daily for 12 days. The most frequent pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli. The clinical response was similar in both groups (89.1%). The bacteriologic eradication rate was 100% in the lomefloxacin group and 94.5% in the cefaclor group. Adverse events were minimal. Once-daily lomefloxacin is a safe and effective treatment for secondary bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefprozil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a fine granular form for pediatric use, was administered to children with bacterial infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) against the following 84 strains isolated from cases to which CFPZ was administered; 55 strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 49 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 29 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. MIC determination of these strains was done with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. In pharmacokinetic studies, serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were investigated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CFPZ was orally administered 30 minutes before meals to 9 children with ages ranging from 7 years and 1 month to 12 years and 3 months. Three groups of 3 children were tested with doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. In addition to the above, clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 160 cases consisting of children with ages ranging 5 months to 12 years and 5 months. A mean dose of 8.6 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses (130 cases of t.i.d. and 30 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 7 days. The 160 cases included 34 cases of pharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 8 cases of acute bronchitis, 8 cases of pneumonia, 52 cases of scarlet fever, 4 cases of acute purulent otitis media, 47 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of posthitis. Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined in 166 cases, including 6 cases excluded from the evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. With regard to GPC, MICs of CFPZ against 2 strains of S. aureus were 0.78 or 1.56 micrograms/ml and CFPZ showed the second highest activity to MCIPC. MICs of CFPZ against 49 strains of S. pyogenes were all less than 0.025 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefprozil granules].
AB  - Cefprozil granule preparation was administered orally to 16 patients (ages ranging 8 months to 9 years and 6 months) with pediatric bacterial infections at daily dose levels between 29.4 and 35.7 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses. The following results were obtained. 1. Sixteen patients including 5 with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 3 with lacunar tonsillitis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with contagious impetigo and 1 with scarlet fever were treated. Clinical effects were excellent in 9 cases and moderate in 7, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens included 17 strains (10 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 of Staphylococcus aureus). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed for 11 strains, but no changes were obtained for 5 (all Haemophilus), and unknown results were obtained for 1, thus the eradication rate was 68.8%. 3. No side effects were observed. Abnormal laboratory test results included 2 cases of increase in platelets, and 2 of increase in eosinophils, but those were not significant. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  - [Overall clinical evaluation of cefprozil against infections in pediatric fields. Pediatric Study Group for Cefprozil].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100) granule preparation was studied for pharmacokinetic,  bacteriological and clinical aspects in the pediatric infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion. The pharmacokinetics of CFPZ in pediatrics was investigated by single oral administration of fine granules at doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg. Peak blood levels of CFPZ were 3.06, 4.62 and 9.65 micrograms/ml, respectively, at 1.00-1.30 hours after each dose and AUCs were 7.44, 12.50 and 27.01 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. These data showed that Cmax and AUC depended on dose levels. T 1/2 (beta) at these dose levels were 1.03, 0.94 and 1.01 hours, respectively. There were no differences related to dose. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration were 51.5-57.1%. The pharmacokinetics of CFPZ before or after meals were also investigated at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg. Peak blood levels were 4.88 micrograms/ml at 1.17 hours after administration in the fasting state, and 4.30 micrograms/ml at 1.54 hours after administration in the non-fasting state. Delay of Tmax and slight decrease of Cmax were observed in the non-fasting state, but T 1/2 and AUC were 0.91 hour and 12.96 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively, in the non-fasting state, and were similar to those in the fasting state, 0.93 hour and 12.82 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration were 63.8% in the fasting state and 50.7% in the non-fasting state. 2. Clinical results. Clinical efficacies of CFPZ granules in various infectious diseases were studied in 804 cases. Twenty nine cases, mostly viral or mycoplasmal infections, were excluded from the statistical analysis. The clinical efficacy rate in 527 cases with causative bacteria isolated was 97.2%; and in 248 cases from whom no significant isolate had been obtained was 96.0%. The clinical efficacy rate in 475 cases with monobacterial infections (proven by culture of isolates) was 97.3%, and that in 52 case with polybacterial infections was 96.2%. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated mostly from acute respiratory infections. In 88 cases from whom H. influenzae was isolated, clinical efficacy rate was 95.5%. In cases from whom H. influenzae was found concomitant by with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae, the clinical efficacy rates were also high. The bacteriological eradication rate in cases with 582 strains was 83.3%; the eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 95.8%; and for Gram-negative organisms, it was 64.2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - In vitro postantibiotic effect of roxithromycin and erythromycin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A persistent suppression of bacterial growth following a brief exposure to an antibiotic (postantibiotic effect [PAE]) has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. Data concerning PAE have not yet been demonstrated in Taiwan. In this study, the PAEs of erythromycin (EM) and roxithromycin (RXM) against 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 of Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested. Dilution method was used for removal of drugs. Two controls, one free of drug and one in 1/1000 of the original drug concentrations were used. The results showed that the PAE lasted longer in strains of S. aureus (RXM 1.7-2.1 h; EM 1.7-2.1 h) and S. pyogenes (RXM 1.7-3.0 h; EM 1.9-2.9 h) than those in S. pneumoniae (RXM 0.6-1.6 h; EM 0.8-1.4 h). There was no difference of PAE between RXM and EM against each bacterial strain tested.
TI  - [Antibody titer to streptococcal and staphylococcal L-form in Behcet's disease and other uveitis].
AB  - The antibody titer in serum to Streptococcus pyogenes L-form and Staphylococcus aureus L-form were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 28 patients with Behcet's disease, 31 patients with other uveitis (sarcoidosis: 10, Harada's disease: 5, tuberculosis: 4, rheumatoid arthritis: 4, lues: 2, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: 2, herpes simplex: 2, trauma: 2) and 16 healthy normal controls. All L-forms were induced by the penicillin disk method. The antibody titer to Streptococcus pyogenes L-form in Behcet's disease was lower than that of other cases of uveitis and controls, and showed significant differences between controls, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and Harada's disease by the Student's t-test. The antibody titer to Staphylococcus aureus L-form in Behcet's disease showed no difference between controls and other cases of uveitis. In each uveitis and controls, and between active and inactive stages of all uveitis, there were no differences between titers. In Behcet's disease, antibody formation to Streptococcus pyogenes L-form may be specifically disturbed.
TI  - Pyomyositis in North America: case reports and review.
AB  - We report two cases and review the characteristics of pyomyositis. The courses of patients who presented with pyomyositis at the Maricopa Medical Center (Phoenix) are detailed. Ninety-eight reported cases over the last 20 years in North America, found through a MEDLINE search, are summarized. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may predispose the patient to pyomyositis. The onset is usually insidious with progression to large purulent collections and significant morbidity. The diagnosis is frequently suggested by findings of imaging studies. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for most cases in tropical areas but is less frequently associated with cases in North America. Since infection with HIV predisposes patients to bacterial infections, pyomyositis will occur more frequently in this patient population. Increased awareness of the disease will improve management. Following aspiration or surgical drainage, therapy with broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics may be considered initially in the treatment of pyomyositis.
TI  - Macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from various bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. Some of the highly purified LTAs, in particular LTAs from Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. As after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these LTAs reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. Other purified LTAs, i.e., LTAs from Streptococcus sanguis, S. pneumoniae, and L. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from Micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native LTA from S. aureus was inactive. There was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of LTAs. Deacylation of LTAs resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated LTAs did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of LTA to the cell surface. The results demonstrate that some LTA species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
TI  - Antibacterial profile of flurithromycin, a new macrolide.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of flurithromycin against common respiratory tract Gram-positive (85 strains) and Gram-negative (44 strains) pathogens, and a collection of anaerobes (125 strains) was compared with that of erythromycin, cefixime, amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and clindamycin. Flurithromycin possessed the same spectrum and potency of antimicrobial activity as erythromycin. The presence of 50% human serum in the test media enhanced the activity of flurithromycin against all isolates, with the exception of Streptococcus pyogenes. Flurithromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) that ranged from 0.25 h (Haemophilus influenzae) to 3.5 h (Streptococcus pneumoniae) for all strains tested. The presence of serum increased or diminished the duration of the PAE, depending on the strain being analysed. No interaction between flurithromycin and the other drugs tested was observed by the checkerboard technique, but when the time-kill system was used, 35 cases of synergy were noted out of 120 tests performed (29%), of which 15 (43%) were with Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (34%) with Staphylococcus aureus, four (11%) with H. influenzae and the remainder with S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Netilmicin produced most synergic interactions. Antagonism was not detected by either methods.
TI  - In-vitro stimulation of TNF-alpha from human whole blood by cell-free supernatants of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are being recognized increasingly as the cause of shock-like syndromes, clinically indistinguishable from those seen in association with Gram-negative endotoxic shock. Much clinical and experimental data link tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock, and a number of studies of individual Gram-positive species have also implicated TNF-alpha. We report here the first systematic study of the ability of cell-free supernatants of common Gram-positive bacteria to induce TNF-alpha from human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. Almost all the 63 strains were able to induce TNF-alpha, although the levels were substantially lower than those obtained from supernatants of Gram-negative bacteria, used as controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci were consistently more active than group B and D streptococci. TNF-alpha induction did not correlate with conventional markers of pathogenicity; amongst strains of Staphylococcus aureus, commensal and blood culture isolates did not induce significantly different amounts of TNF. We conclude that cell-free supernatants of most Gram-positive bacteria are capable of inducing TNF-alpha from human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro, but the significance of this finding remains to be determined.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes: sequence of the binding domain involved in adherence of streptococci to epithelial cells.
AB  - The sequence of the fibronectin-binding domain of the fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (Sfb protein) was determined, and its role in streptococcal adherence was investigated by use of an Sfb fusion protein in adherence studies. A 1-kb DNA fragment coding for the binding domain of Sfb protein was cloned into the expression vector pEX31 to produce an Sfb fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal part of MS2 polymerase and a C-terminal fragment of the streptococcal protein. Induction of the vector promoter resulted in hyperexpression of fibronectin-binding fusion protein in the cytoplasm of the recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Sequence determination of the cloned 1-kb fragment revealed an in-frame reading frame for a 268-amino-acid peptide composed of a 37-amino-acid sequence which is completely repeated three times and incompletely repeated a fourth time. Cloning of one repeat into pEX31 resulted in expression of small fusion peptides that show fibronectin-binding activity, indicating that one repeat contains at least one binding domain. Each repeat exhibits two charged domains and shows high homology with the 38-amino-acid D3 repeat of the fibronectin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus. Sequence comparison with other streptococcal ligand-binding surface proteins, including M protein, failed to reveal significant homology, which suggests that Sfb protein represents a novel type of functional protein in S. pyogenes. The Sfb fusion protein isolated from the cytoplasm of recombinant cells was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. It showed a strong competitive inhibition of fibronectin binding to S. pyogenes and of the adherence of bacteria to cultured epithelial cells. In contrast, purified streptococcal lipoteichoic acid showed only a weak inhibition of fibronectin binding and streptococcal adherence. These results demonstrate that Sfb protein is directly involved in the fibronectin-mediated adherence of S. pyogenes to epithelial cells.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-74,667. A new fluoroquinolone compared with other quinolones.
AB  - CP-74,667, a 6-fluoro-7-bridged piperazinyl-1-cyclopropyl-4 quinolone, inhibited  90% of staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 4 micrograms/ml and an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. CP-74,667 was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and St. pyogenes, but equal or less active than tosufloxacin against Gram-positive species. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa was 5 micrograms/ml similar to temafloxacin. The CP-74,667 MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 2 micrograms/ml, equal to tosufloxacin and temafloxacin. Activity was eight- to 16-fold less at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.4 and also eight- to 16-fold less in urine. Magnesium ions markedly increased the CP-74,667 minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The development of resistance to CP-74,667 was similar to that found for other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Superantigens, T cells, and microbes.
AB  - It is well recognized that toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are responsible for a wide range of clinical conditions, although their precise mode of action remains unclear. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in these toxins, now grouped with superantigens, because they cause profound alterations in the immune system homeostasis. Superantigens are molecules, including endogenous retroviral gene products and microbial toxins, that share a unique set of characteristics. They bind with high affinity to major histocompatibility complex class II at regions distinct from the conventional antigen binding groove and cause prolific activation or anergy of T cells with certain T cell receptor variable-region gene families. Whilst most of the superantigens described to date are products of bacteria or viruses, the presence of superantigens in parasites and their role in disease pathogenesis remain to be defined. It is probable that associations are present between superantigen-induced proliferation or anergy of peripheral blood T cells and clinical manifestations of human infectious diseases. The identification of these may pave the way toward a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and the possible development of newer immunotherapeutic regimes. This review summarizes the current thinking on microbial superantigens, their association with human T cells, and speculations about their significance.
TI  - Loracarbef vs. cefaclor in pediatric skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - A double blind, randomized clinical trial involving 214 children, ages 6 months to 12 years, compared the safety and effectiveness of the new carbacephem loracarbef and the cephalosporin cefaclor for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections. The two agents were given primarily as oral suspensions. Dosages were 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for loracarbef and 20 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for cefaclor. Assessment 72 hours after completion of the 7-day course of treatment indicated a favorable clinical response plus eradication of the pretherapy pathogen in 97.3% of the 74 loracarbef-treated patients eligible for evaluation and 92.3% of 78 evaluable cefaclor-treated patients. Favorable response rates at a second posttreatment visit 10 to 14 days after the end of therapy were 95.6% in 68 evaluable loracarbef-treated patients and 86.2% in 65 treated with cefaclor. The incidence of adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal effects, was low in both groups. No statistical difference in clinical or bacteriologic efficacy or safety was detected between patients treated with loracarbef and cefaclor.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Evaluation of cefuroxime axetil and cefadroxil suspensions for treatment of pediatric skin infections.
AB  - A randomized, single-blind, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cefuroxime axetil and cefadroxil suspensions for the treatment of skin or skin structure infections in 287 children. Each drug was given at a dosage of 30 mg/kg of body weight per day in two divided doses. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, or a combination of the two, were the primary pathogens isolated from infected skin lesions. A satisfactory bacteriological response (cure or presumed cure) was obtained in 97.1 and 94.3% of children in the cefuroxime axetil and cefadroxil groups, respectively (P greater than 0.05). Satisfactory clinical responses (cure or improvement) were more likely to occur in cefuroxime axetil recipients than in cefadroxil recipients (97.8 versus 90.3%; P less than 0.05). Both regimens were equally well tolerated, with adverse events occurring in 7.9 and 6.1% of cefuroxime axetil and cefadroxil recipients, respectively. There were more patients who refused to take cefuroxime axetil (7 of 189) than there were who refused to take cefadroxil (0 of 98), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.1). In this study, cefuroxime axetil was at least as effective as cefadroxil in resolving skin and skin structure infections in children.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Murine model of cutaneous infection with gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has remained an important cause of nosocomial wound infections, but standardized or reproducible systems for analyzing cutaneous infections caused by S. aureus do not exist. A variety of foreign materials, variable inocula, and skin traumas have been used to promote infection. To minimize these variables and ensure reproducibility, we chose a model using subcutaneous injections of a fixed quantity of dextran microbeads (Cytodex) as the foreign material added to standardized broth suspensions of S. aureus. Suspensions (0.2 ml) injected into an outbred strain of immunocompetent hairless mice generated reproducible, measurable lesions. With S. aureus Smith Diffuse, fluctuant, erythematous lesions with a peak diameter of 15 mm were observed; these lesions yielded purulent material containing gram-positive cocci and neutrophils and yielded growth of S. aureus on culture. Lesion size was proportional to the bacterial inoculum size. Histologic examination of excised lesions revealed typical abscesses. A second strain of S. aureus (SLC3) produced dermonecrosis instead of abscesses at an inoculum size of 10(7) CFU. Control injections with a sterile Cytodex suspension regularly produced nondraining, nonerythematous nodules with maximum diameters of less than or equal to 5 mm. Streptococcus pyogenes produced late-onset necrotic lesions and abscesses. Using a foreign substance, this model generates easily observed and reproducible cutaneous infection with S. aureus and streptococci that can potentially discriminate between inter- and intrastrain differences. Such a model could be used to test the pathogenicity of isogeneic strains of these bacterial species and to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - Studies on azopyrazole derivatives. Part 9: Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel phenylhydrazones and their substituted 4-arylazopyrazole derivatives.
AB  - 6-Methyl-2,4-heptandione (1) was coupled with diazonium salts of sulfanilamide (2) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (3). Resulting new hydrazones, namely 4-methyl-2-oxovaleraldehyde p-substituted phenylhydrazones 4 and 5, were refluxed with various hydrazines to synthesize the title compounds 6-15. Their structure elucidation was made on the basis of their analytical and spectroscopic data. The antibacterial activity was evaluated. Some of the compounds tested exerted moderate to potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - A comparison of two commercially irradiated Trypticase Soy Agars containing lecithin and polysorbate 80.
AB  - Gamma-radiation sterilized Trypticase Soy Agar containing lecithin and polysorbate 80 (TSA++) (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) and irradiated TSA++ (Adams Scientific, West Warwick, RI) were tested by a quantitative spread plate method. Four bacteria Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested in two separate experiments using different lots of media. A strain of Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, was tested by a qualitative streak plate method. The Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems (BDMS) irradiated TSA++ overall recovered a greater number of organisms than the Adams Scientific TSA++ in both experiments and allowed for the earlier recovery of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615. The growth of A. niger ATCC 16404, was comparable on both media. Efficacy of the media to neutralize 1, 2 and 3% phenol as well as 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BC) solutions was done by a disk diffusion method using 2 gram-positive and 4 gram-negative bacteria. Both media showed complete neutralization of the 0.001 and 0.01% BC solutions and partial neutralization of the 0.1% BC solution. The BDMS TSA++ showed better neutralization of the 2 and 3% phenol solutions than the Adams Scientific TSA++. This data indicates that not all irradiated TSA++ media perform in an equivalent manner.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin RP 59500.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus pyogenes produce toxic shock syndrome characterized by hypotension and multisystem organ failure. While conventional therapy has consisted of antibiotics and intensive supportive care, some experimental evidence suggests that immunoglobulins directed against the toxins may be effective additional therapy. We report a case of "toxic strep syndrome" in which intravenous immunoglobulin was administered when signs and symptoms were worsening while the patient was receiving conventional therapy. Within hours of administration of the intravenous immunoglobulin, the patient experienced dramatic clinical improvement. This response suggests a possible therapeutic benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin in toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis with cefprozil: review of three multicenter trials.
AB  - Cefprozil is a new oral cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity that  includes group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes). Three multicenter, randomized trials were conducted for comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil administered once or twice daily with that of cefaclor, penicillin, or erythromycin ethylsuccinate administered three or four times daily in the treatment of mild-to-moderate tonsillopharyngitis. In the cefprozil-cefaclor trial, the pathogen eradication rate for evaluable patients receiving cefprozil was 83%, which was significantly better than that for patients receiving cefaclor (76%) (P = .035). The rate of satisfactory clinical response was similar with cefprozil (89%) and cefaclor (84%). The overall response rate was significantly better with cefprozil (80%) than with cefaclor (72%, P = .018). Differences in response rates were not noted when analyzing only patients 2-12 years of age. In the cefprozil-penicillin trial, the eradication rate of bacteriologic pathogens was similar in patients receiving cefprozil (91%) and in patients receiving penicillin (87%). A satisfactory clinical response was seen in 95% of the evaluable cefprozil-treated patients, which was significantly better than the rate of satisfactory clinical response seen in the penicillin-treated patients (88%; P = .023). In addition, during-therapy cultures for penicillin-treated patients yielded a significantly higher rate of beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus than did those for the group of cefprozil-treated patients (13% vs. 4.5%, respectively; P = .046). Significantly more clinically symptomatic bacteriologic failures occurred in the penicillin group (P = .037).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The characterization of two new low molecular weight proteins (LMPs) from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Two novel extracellular mitogenic substances were isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes strain NY-5 and characterized. The purification steps involved an initial enrichment of the proteins from culture supernatant by silica gel adsorption, followed by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified materials were homogeneous in SDS-PAGE, showed estimated molecular weights of 12 kD and isoelectric points of 4.7 and 4.3, respectively. Both proteins (LMP-12k-4.3pI and LMP-12k-4.7pI) demonstrated lymphocyte transformation activity at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml. The LMP-12k-4.7pI showed a 69.2% homology of the amino acid sequence with that of a phosphocarrier protein of Staphylococcus aureus and with a total identity in the active centre. The same protein was also isolated from streptococcal group C strain H46A with an N-terminal amino acid sequence being identical. The LMP-12k-4.7pI demonstrated biochemical properties identical with those of the earlier described streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type D. The LMP-12k-4.3pI did not show such a clear relation to other functional proteins.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies on meropenem in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies have been performed on meropenem (MEPM, SM-7338), a newly developed carbapenem antibiotic, in the pediatric field. 1. Antibacterial activities of MEPM against 24 clinical isolates were determined. MEPM showed excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Branhamella catarrhalis. Against Haemophilus influenzae, MEPM had a higher activity than imipenem and flomoxef, but had a lower activity than piperacillin and cefoperazone. 2. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 32 cases with bacterial infections. A poor efficacy was observed in 1 patient with phlegmon but excellent or good efficacies were obtained in other 31 patients with tonsillitis (1), pneumonia (17), UTI (12), or SSSS (1). The overall efficacy rate was 96.9%. All strains except 1 of S. aureus were eradicated by the administration of MEPM, and a high eradication rate of 95.8% (23 out of 24 strains) was obtained. 3. No side effects were observed in 35 evaluated cases. As abnormal laboratory test results, elevated GOT, elevated GPT, eosinophilia and neutropenia were noted in 4, 4, 4 and 2 patients, respectively. 4. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. PIVKA II was elevated upon administration of MEPM in some cases, but no changes in ATT, TT, HPT or Fbg were observed during the treatment. Based on the above results, it has been concluded that MEPM is a safe and effective drug to use in the treatment of pediatric infections. The usual recommended dosage and administration should be 10 to 20 mg/kg of MEPM at a time, using intravenous drip infusion, 3 times a day.

TI  - [Acute suppurative thyroiditis and Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. A case report and review of the literature].
AB  - The acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare infection. It affects specially patients with preexisting thyroid gland pathology and its frequency is higher in women. In childhood it's linked to local anatomic defects. The infection used to be located in left thyroid lobe and it's much less usual in right lobe, in both or in isthmus. The most important causal microorganisms are staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus overcoat) and streptococci (usually Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae), with frequent isolation of mixed flora and anaerobes in the last reported cases. We present the case of a male patient, without previous thyroid disease, who suffered an acute suppurative thyroiditis and Sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, with right lobe abscess and secondary septic focus formation (kidneys, spleen, lungs), with fatal course despite of medical treatment, favoured or precipitated by the development of serious alcoholic abstinence.
TI  - Sporeamicin A, a new macrolide antibiotic. III. Biological properties.
AB  - Sporeamicin A is a new erythromycin-type antibiotic isolated from a species of Saccharopolyspora. It was active in vitro against a wide variety of Gram-positive bacteria. In vitro studies indicated that the sporeamicin A was stable in the presence of human serum, although it was bound to serum proteins. Sporeamicin A was effective in the mouse protection test against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Sporeamicin A attained higher plasma and tissue levels in the rat than did erythromycin stearate.
TI  - The effect of roxithromycin on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Antibiotics whose recognized mode of action comprises inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis are also recognized to modulate the expression of bacterial virulence factors when incorporated into culture media at sub-MIC levels. In this respect, one of the new macrolides, roxithromycin, has been examined for its effect on toxin/enzyme production by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Biosynthesis of staphylococcal coagulase and DNase could be potentiated, whereas that of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, streptolysins O and S, and pneumolysin were unaltered. Expression of one structural virulence factor, pneumococcal polysaccharide, was repressed in the drug's presence, resulting in potentiation of phagocytic ingestion of the drug-exposed bacteria. The drug failed to have any effect on ingestion of Staph. aureus or Strep. pyogenes. These studies provide evidence that roxithromycin may exhibit "added value" as an antibiotic in its ability to potentiate the susceptibility of Strep. pneumoniae to host defenses such as phagocytosis.
TI  - Infected aortic aneurysms. A changing entity.
AB  - Infected (mycotic) aortic aneurysms are infrequent and, without surgical intervention, usually lead to uncontrolled sepsis or catastrophic hemorrhage. Symptoms are frequently absent or non-specific during the early stages, and a high index of suspicion is essential to make the diagnosis. Surgery performed after rupture carries high morbidity and mortality rates. Bacterial endocarditis with streptococcus pyogenes was the most common cause of infected aortic aneurysm in the pre-antibiotic era. Today, arterial trauma due to iatrogenic manipulation and depressed immunocompetence have become more common risk factors. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella are the most frequent bacteria identified. The authors' recent experience in six patients with infected aortic aneurysms who underwent arteriography and computed tomography was reviewed and these diagnostic methods compared. Computed tomography was found to be more sensitive in the diagnosis of the early stages of the disease, allowing for follow-up by serial scans in a noninvasive and less costly manner. Successful treatment, in four of these patients, was accomplished by aneurysmal resection and extra-anatomic bypass or in situ prosthetic reconstruction. A higher clinical awareness of this disease, leading to early computed tomography evaluation and prompt surgical intervention under appropriate and intensive antibiotic therapy, appears to offer the best chance of survival in patients with this difficult condition.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - [Studies on panipenem/betamipron in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in pediatrics were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a combined drug of a carbapenem antibiotic (panipenem) and organic ion inhibitor (betamipron) at a weight ratio of 1:1. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion were studied when PAPM/BP, at 10 mg/10 mg/kg (4 cases) or 20 mg/20 mg/kg (5 cases), was administered using intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 9 children (4-14 years old). The plasma PAPM level at the end of drip infusion was 30.75 +/- 4.98 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 68.72 +/- 5.73 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Drug concentrations then gradually decreased with half-lives of 1.08 +/- 0.09 hours and 0.98 +/- 0.02 hour, and reached 0.39 +/- 0.14 micrograms/ml and 0.62 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively, after 5.5 hours. Plasma BP levels at the end of drip infusion was 18.93 +/- 3.75 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 37.09 +/- 2.68 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 20 mg/kg, and half-lives were 0.55 +/- 0.07 hour and 0.61 +/- 0.03 hour, respectively; the plasma BP level could not be determined in any cases after 5.5 hours. Mean urinary recovery rates of PAPM in the first 6 hours after the start of intravenous drip infusion were 33.0 +/- 6.1% in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 21.8 +/- 2.3% in the cases administered 20 mg/20 mg/kg and those of BP were 77.0 +/- 2.4% and 76.6 +/- 7.3%, respectively. 2. When PAPM/BP, was administered at 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg thought by intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 1 case of purulent meningitis, PAPM levels were 0.76 micrograms/ml at the end of drip infusion but varied between 0.80 to 1.97 micrograms/ml 30 minutes after the end of drip infusion during 8 days of treatment. 3. PAPM/BP was administered to 43 cases, 47 diseases of bacterial infections in the domain of pediatrics to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions. Single doses were 5.2mg/5.2mg to 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg; frequencies of administration were 3 to 4 times a day, and durations of administration were 3 1/3 to 11 days; and total dosages ranged between 1.125 g/1.125 g and 11.0 g/11.0 g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Secondary metabolites by chemical screening. 17. Nigericinol derivatives: synthesis, biological activities, and modeling studies.
AB  - The synthesis and the biological activity of C-1-reduced nigericin derivatives (nigericinols) are described and discussed. The dichloronigericinol 7 impressively demonstrated that the C-1 carboxylic acid moiety was not required for a distinct activity against bacteria and viruses. Based on the correlation between K+/H+ antiport activities and antibacterial activities it was deduced that the mode of action of the described nigericinols are related to their ionophoric properties. Molecular modeling studies showed that the efficiency of the nigericinols as ionophores correlates, qualitatively, with the probability of forming a cyclic structure, with the exception of 7.
TI  - Bactericidal titers of loracarbef (LY 163892) in serum and killing rates in volunteers receiving 400 versus 200 milligrams.
AB  - In a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (LY 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. Mean +/- standard error of the mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. Bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). Other species (Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. Killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/MIC ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the MIC. Our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.
TI  - Changing flora in burn and trauma units: experience in the United Kingdom.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of burned and devitalized tissue is inevitable. The types  of organisms that are isolated from burn wounds depend on such factors as preexisting illness, types of topical antiseptics and antimicrobials used, microbial sampling techniques, and indigenous flora that inhibit the burn unit. Among organisms that are capable of producing disease, Staphylococcus aureus remains the most common isolate in the patient with burns. The decrease in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was initiated by the advent of effective topical antiseptics, appears to have continued to the present. Acinetobacter is now a common organism in the burn unit; although the organism has developed resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, it infrequently causes serious problems. Comparisons between burn units with intensive-care capability that practice an aggressive approach to surgical management and burn units that continue to use a more traditional approach have revealed little difference with regard to incidence of or time to acquisition of potentially pathogenic bacteria. In a recent comparison that involved a unit of each type, marked reductions in the incidence of isolation of P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus group A organisms were observed over the course of 2 years in both of the units. Significant problems with viruses, yeasts, and fungi have not yet been encountered (or identified) in burn units; further study of the potential role of such organisms in infection in the patient with burns is required.
TI  - Bacterial quantification--a necessary complement for the comprehension of middle  ear inflammations.
AB  - Quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained during current acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) was performed. The bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. During AOM, 53% of the MEE samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). During OME, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml (median value 10(4) per ml). Mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). During COM, purulent MEE had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). Quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome in infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes].
AB  - Acute infections with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus normally take a favourable course under therapy with penicillin. Only in a few cases has a completely different manifestation been described with multisystem failure similar to toxic shock syndrome induced by Staphylococcus aureus. We report on 4 patients (1990/91) who showed this manifestation in spite of immediate antibiotic therapy. In 3 patients the suspected portal of entry was the skin, in 1 patient it was unknown. Group A streptococci were grown from blood cultures from all 4 patients. Without an underlying immune deficiency all 4 patients (age 22, 24, 38 and 51) went into septic shock with high fever, hepatic and renal impairment, diarrhea, DIC and cerebral confusion. 2 patients died within a few days after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and cerebral edema. All strains isolated from the patients were penicillin-sensitive, group A streptococci. 3 of them were M-type 1, which are known to be more invasive. The bacteremia by itself is not sufficient to explain all complications and the high mortality rate. It is probable that streptococcal toxins, such as pyrogenic exotoxin A, streptolysin O, or a new unknown one, play a decisive role.
TI  - A zymographic assay for detection of hyaluronidase activity on polyacrylamide gels and its application to enzymatic activity found in bacteria.
AB  - A zymographic assay for the determination of hyaluronidase activity in cell-free  extracts on native polyacrylamide gels has been developed. In this assay an agarose replica of the polyacrylamide gel which contains hyaluronic acid and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used. After an incubation at 37 degrees C to allow transfer and development of enzymatic activity, the hyaluronic acid and BSA were precipitated in the agarose gel with 2 M acetic acid. Areas of enzymatic activity appeared as clear zones in the agarose replica. The assay was sensitive and was used to demonstrate hyaluronidase activity in cell-free extracts from a number of bacterial and mammalian species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of MDL 62,873, a semisynthetic derivative of teicoplanin,  in vitro and in experimental infections.
AB  - MDL 62,873 is an amide derivative of teicoplanin A2-2. Like those of natural glycopeptides, its antibacterial activity is mediated by inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Against streptococci and enterococci, the in vitro activity of MDL 62,873 was similar to that of teicoplanin and greater than that of vancomycin. Against staphylococci, it has activity similar to that of vancomycin, and it was significantly more active than teicoplanin against coagulase-negative isolates. Like teicoplanin and vancomycin, MDL 62,873 had slow but significant bactericidal activity (99 to 99.9% killing in 24 h) against staphylococci at concentrations near the MIC. In murine septicemia studies with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the 50% effective doses were lower than those of vancomycin. In staphylococcal endocarditis in rats, MDL 62,873 at 20 mg/kg of body weight and vancomycin at 40 mg/kg, both doses given intravenously twice daily, had similar efficacies in reducing the heart bacterial load. These results probably reflect the longer half-life of MDL 62,873, which has a pharmacokinetic profile in rats similar to that of teicoplanin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. Meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Against Gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. It inhibited all 330 strains of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. Meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an MIC90 of 0.78 mg/l. The therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. From the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - Rapid antibody capture assay for detection of group-A streptococci using monoclonal antibody and colloidal gold-monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugate.
AB  - A rapid one step, sensitive and specific antibody capture assay for detection of  group-A streptococci from the throat swabs of children is described. Monoclonal antibody either MA-106 or MA-107 specific for group-A streptococci polysaccharide (APS) was used as the capture antibody on nitrocellulose paper and rabbit monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugated with colloidal gold to detect the presence of antigen. The lower detection limit of this assay is 15.6ng APS/ml. The assay is specific for APS and failed to recognize polysaccharides obtained from group-B,-C,-G streptococci as well as Staphylococcus aureus. Antigen extracted from throat swabs of children who were positive for beta-hemolytic plaques (other than group-A streptococci) as seen on blood agar culture gave negative readings, thereby confirming the specificity of the assay for APS.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of 5% and 10% granules of  cefdinir in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of CFDN against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX) and amoxicillin (AMPC). MIC80's of CFDN against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results show that CFDN has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. MIC80's of CFDN against Gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of AMPC, and was lower than those of CCL and CFIX. As for antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the MIC80 of CFIX against H. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of CFDN. THe MIC80's of CFDN against other GNB were similar to those of CFIX. 2. Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of CFDN 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. The data on CFDN 10% granules were similar to those on CFDN 5% granules. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (Cmax's) of CFDN ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. At a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. Blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. AUC's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. With administration of single 100 mg capsule, Cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, T1/2's and AUC's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in otitis prone children treated with immunoglobulin.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate possible beneficial effects of regularly given, long term immunoglobulin prophylaxis of children below 2 years of age with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM). The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora and the frequency of acute otitis media (AOM) and secretory otitis media SOM were studied. Every second of 44 children with 3 or more periods of AOM during the last year received immunoglobulin intramuscularly (Gammaglobulin Kabi 165 mg/l, 0.45 ml/kg b.w.) every third week for 6 months, while the other 22 children served as controls. All children were followed for 12 months. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis neither influenced the nasopharyngeal flora, nor the frequency of AOM or SOM periods. Children with AOM or SOM more often harbored bacterial pathogens in their nasopharynx than children with normal middle ear status. Also, the immunoglobulin prophylaxis did not influence the increased frequency of bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx of children attending public day care or family day care as compared to those taken care of at home.
TI  - Bullous impetigo caused by group A streptococci. A case report.
AB  - Bullous impetigo is considered to be a staphylococcal disease. Staphylococcus aureus, phage type 71, produces an epidermolytic toxin, assumed to be the cause of bullous formation in the skin. We present a case of bullous impetigo. Microbiological tests suggested beta-hemolytic streptococci, group A, M-type 3, as the etiological agent. Group A streptococci were isolated from the throat of the patient's mother and brother. The strains were shown to be identical, by means of DNA-'fingerprinting' and M-typing.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - The comparative activity of fleroxacin, three other quinolones and eight unrelated antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. Fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The MICs of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of Enterobacteriaceae except Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). Fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against Pseudomonas spp, (MIC90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). Acinetobacter and Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against Acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against H. influenzae. Methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). In addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against Enterococcus spp. (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. These results suggest that fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most Enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Evaluation of the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin.
AB  - Although the fluoroquinolones share many properties, these agents differ in their ability to kill the same bacterial strain. The bactericidal activity of temafloxacin against a number of pathogens has been compared with that of other fluoroquinolones by determination of minimal bactericidal concentration, time-kill kinetics, and postantibiotic effect. Studies have demonstrated that temafloxacin has equivalent or superior ability to kill when compared with other fluoroquinolones. Temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and PD 117558 were more active than other fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium avium complex, with 90% minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC90S; 8-16 micrograms/mL) four- to eightfold greater than 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC90S; 2 micrograms/mL). Against Chlamydia trachomatis the MIC90 and MBC90 of temafloxacin were both 0.25 microgram/mL; ciprofloxacin was less active (MBC90 twice the MIC90), and norfloxacin was least active. Temafloxacin demonstrated more rapid killing kinetics than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin at all concentrations tested against Streptococcus pyogenes. Findings were similar against Streptococcus pneumoniae at antibiotic concentrations of 1-2 micrograms/mL. Similar time-kill curves against Escherichia coli were observed for temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and difloxacin. Time-kill kinetics of temafloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were superior to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Postantibiotic effect with temafloxacin against Legionella pneumophila showed a considerable delay in regrowth, and temafloxacin delayed regrowth of MRSA and MSSA to a greater extent than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. By the three methods used in the studies to assess bactericidal activity that are currently published, temafloxacin had equivalent or superior activity to the comparative fluoroquinolones tested. Other organisms remain to be tested and the significance of these findings determined in clinical studies.
TI  - Stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) isolated from bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. LTAs from S. aureus and S. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. However, LTAs from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The kinetics of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by LTAs closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. Cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. Hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. Deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. Deacylated LTAs were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact LTAs, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. The results identify some species of LTAs as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  - Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. Bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ENT and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. The antibiotics were given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. With beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced MICs consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. Combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on E. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. Amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on Streptococcus pyogenes and S. Pneumoniae. The bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on S. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. Cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus. These antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on Gram positive microorganisms. These pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.
TI  - The killing activity of microwaves on some non-sporogenic and sporogenic medically important bacterial strains.
AB  - The killing activity of microwaves of 2450 MHz frequency and 325 W, 650 W and 1400 W power on some bacterial strains was investigated. Vegetative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis and spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillis stearothermophilus in aqueous suspensions were exposed to 325 W and 650 W waves for different lengths of time. Enterococcus faecalis and spores of B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus were exposed additionally to 1400 W waves in aqueous and 'dried' suspensions. Vegetative bacteria were promptly killed in 5 min or less, E. faecalis being slightly more resistant. Bacterial spores were only killed in aqueous suspension when a 1400 W setting was used for 10 to 20 min. Bacterial spores adhering to the tube walls after the aqueous suspension was poured out were reduced in number. We assume that the conventional microwave ovens available on the market may be used for a high level of disinfection but not for sterilization, and only then if sufficient water is present.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus cephalexin in the treatment of skin, skin structure, and soft-tissue infections in adults.
AB  - A multicenter study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of oral ofloxacin with that of cephalexin in microbiologic eradication of skin and skin-structure pathogens and the clinical treatment of skin and skin-structure infections. The subjects, 335 adult patients with acute localized infections of the skin, skin structure, or soft tissue, were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of ofloxacin orally every 12 hours or 500 mg of cephalexin orally every six hours for 10 days. At admission, 398 aerobic pathogens were isolated, the most common being Staphylococcus aureus (160 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (49), coagulase-negative staphylococci (30), Staphylococcus epidermidis (25), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10). Of 317 isolates tested against ofloxacin, 96% were susceptible, and of 325 tested against cephalexin, 85% were susceptible (P less than 0.001). Microbiologic and clinical outcome were evaluated in 73 ofloxacin-treated patients and in 65 cephalexin-treated patients. The causative pathogens were eradicated in 95% of the ofloxacin group and in 92% of the cephalexin group. In the ofloxacin group, 75% were clinically cured and 23% improved, and in the cephalexin group, 74% and 23%, respectively. Drug-related adverse experiences were reported by 14% of the 161 ofloxacin-treated patients and by 11% of the 162 cephalexin-treated patients; gastrointestinal disturbances were reported by 8% and 7% and nervous system effects by 6% and 1%, respectively (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that both ofloxacin and cephalexin are safe and effective in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Applications of BLIS typing to studies of the survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  - A typing scheme based on detection of the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) was a useful tool in a series of epidemiological studies of the spread and survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci. The organisms survived for longer periods on glass, plastic, stainless steel and latex surfaces than on unpainted wood or paper. The presence of saliva as a suspending medium prolonged the viability of Staphylococcus aureus C55 and Streptococcus pyogenes FF22 but not of Strep. salivarius Min 5. Young children were shown to carry Strep. salivarius of identical BLIS-types on their fingers and in their saliva. BLIS typing of Strep. salivarius strains obtained from telephone mouthpieces and from the tongue-sealed flap of envelopes was used as a method of tracing the human source of the salivary deposits.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluations of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482)  (10% fine granules), a new oral cephem, were performed in pediatrics. 1. Bioequivalencies of plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN 5% and 10% fine granules were investigated on 3 pediatric patients with ages between 5 to 13 years administered with a drug in fasting state at a dose level of 3 mg/kg using a cross over method. Average plasma concentrations in a group of patients administered with 5% fine granules peaked at 3 hours after administration with a level of 1.05 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.) and decreased to 0.12 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.48 +/- 0.09 hours. In the group administered with 10% fine granules, average plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration with a level of 1.32 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml, and decreased to 0.20 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.68 +/- 0.28 hours. The first 8-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in the 5% and 10% fine granules groups averaged 19.64 +/- 5.69% and 23.37 +/- 2.36%, respectively. Both average and individual plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates in the patients of the 10% fine granules group were somewhat higher than those of the 5% fine granules group, but no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups including areas under concentrations. 2. CFDN 10% fine granule preparation was administered to 33 pediatric patients with ages between 1 to 13 years with various infections, and its clinical effects, bacteriological effects and safety were assessed. In 31 of the 33 patients (2 patients were excluded since they were with non-bacterial infections) clinical effects were excellent in all of 9 patients with scarlet fever (3), acute pharyngitis (3) or impetigo (3), excellent in 12 and good in 3 of 15 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, and excellent in 4 and good in 3 of 7 patients with acute pneumonia. The overall efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriological effects against causative organisms were evaluated. All the identified Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1) were eradicated. Of 10 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains were eradicated and the other one was reduced. Of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae 4 were eradicated, 1 persisted and the fate of the remaining 2 were unknown. The overall eradication rate was 90.0%. Microbial substitutions were observed in 5 patients. The new, replacing bacteria were all Haemophilus spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefdinir in pediatric infections].
AB  - Five percent fine granule preparation of cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) was administered  to 30 patients with acute febrile respiratory tract infections (RTI) at 4.9-21.1 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. And 10% fine granule preparation of CFDN was also administered to 11 patients with acute febrile RTI and 1 patient with urinary tract infection at 10.0-20.0 mg/kg/day divided into 3 portions. Good clinical effects observed in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) with acute pharyngitis, 12 of 13 patients (92.3%) with acute tonsillitis, 2 of 4 patients (50.0%) with pneumonia and a patient with urinary tract infection. From these patients, 34 causative organisms were isolated. Ten (83.3%) of 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 (46.2%) of 13 strains of Haemophillus influenzae and 1 strain of Escherichia coli were eradicated from these patients. Among the patients with pneumonia, CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group showed better clinical responses and better bacteriological effects against H. influenzae among the patients given CFDN 20 mg/kg/day dose group than those given CFDN 5 mg/kg/day dose group. Side effects were noted in 2 cases, one case had soft stools and the other had diarrheas.
TI  - Lack of emergence of significant resistance in vitro and in vivo to the new azalide antibiotic azithromycin.
AB  - In vitro experiments were performed in which 6 to 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae were passaged nine times in sub-lethal concentrations of azithromycin or control antibiotics. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus quickly became resistant to rifampin as the MIC90 increased from 0.1 to greater than 50 micrograms/ml for both species. The MIC90 of azithromycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and cefaclor increased by three dilutions for Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC values of azithromycin for Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae strains did not change significantly. However, for Haemophilus influenzae and the Enterobacteriaceae strains, the MIC values of erythromycin and oral cephalosporins increased four-fold. In the in vivo experiments, mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli contaminated sutures were administered azithromycin for three days, and on day 6 viable bacterial cells were recovered from the infection site. The sustained tissue concentrations of azithromycin indicated that the organisms would have been continuously exposed to azithromycin at the site of infection. Colonies isolated from azithromycin-treated and non-treated mice were cultured and their susceptibility to azithromycin compared. The azithromycin MIC values for Staphylococcus aureus cultures from treated and non-treated animals were identical. The azithromycin MICs for Escherichia coli recovered from treated animals were on average, less than one dilution higher than for control cultures. Emergence of significant resistance to azithromycin in the laboratory was not observed with the pathogens tested.
TI  - Bacterial toxins induce heat shock proteins in human neutrophils.
AB  - We studied the influence of different bacterial toxins (alveolysin; toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, TSST-1 and erythrogenic toxin A, ETA) on the expression of heat shock proteins (hsps) in isolated human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs). As was shown by Western blotting (anti-hsp72) ETA and TSST-1 were potent inducers of hsps at low toxin concentrations (10 ng/ml). Alveolysin led to the expression of hsps at hemolytic concentrations (1 HU; 700 ng/ml) whereas at subhemolytic concentrations (7 ng/ml) no heat shock response was observed. The induction of heat shock proteins was also accompanied by increased mRNA levels for hsp70 as was determined by PCR-analysis.
TI  - Azithromycin compared with cephalexin in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - This randomized, third-party-blinded study compared short-course therapy of once-daily azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg/day on days 2-5) with cephalexin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of patients with skin and skin structure infections. At 25 centers, a total of 361 patients were entered into the study and 148 were evaluable for efficacy. The main causative pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, were responsible for approximately two thirds of the infections in the two treatment groups. Clinical cure and improvement rates for the two treatments were comparable; 99% with azithromycin and 96% with cephalexin. On completion of therapy, both treatments had eradicated approximately 98% of pathogens. In general, both agents were well-tolerated. The results of this study show that a 5-day course of once-daily treatment with azithromycin is as effective as a 10-day course of twice-daily treatment with cephalexin in the management of skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle that is endemic in the tropics and is being recognized with increasing frequency in temperate climates. We report two cases of nonendemic pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus. A review of the literature suggests that diabetes mellitus may be an important risk factor for the development of pyomyositis. Possible mechanisms of this association are discussed.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka].
AB  - We examined MICs of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in Osaka during the period from January to June in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. All species excluding Streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. In new quinolones, tosufloxacin (TFLX) was the most active against Gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX had the highest activities against Gram-negative rods. 2. Resistant (MIC of CPFX greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of P. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. But, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. Twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 S. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. Methicillin susceptible S. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.
TI  - [Bactericide activity of cefadroxil comparated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,  cefaclor and josamycin].
AB  - Betalactamase-producing organisms are responsible for an increasing number of ENT and lower respiratory tract infections. Or cephalosporins and the combination of amoxicillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid are alternatives to ampicillin therapy. The killing activity of cefadroxil on the organisms most often responsible for ENT and respiratory infections was evaluated in vitro using a viable bacteria count method, comparatively with cefaclor, josamycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Killing activity was found to be time-dependent for all the antimicrobial agents studied. Cefadroxil exhibited the same bactericidal effect on Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae than the other agents. Haemophilus influenzae and an increasing number of Pneumococcus strains were resistant to josamycin which is therefore not appropriate for first-line therapy. As compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefadroxil was less active on H. influenzae and more active on Staphylococcus aureus. Production of beta-lactamase failed to influence the killing activity of cefadroxil. These bacteriologic data, together with results of pharmacologic studies (long half-life and good penetration within tissues) can explain the clinical successes obtained with cefadroxil in ENT and lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in the condensates from air pressure systems in dental offices.
AB  - We examined the air pressure systems in 23 dental offices and found growth of Group A Streptococci and/or Staphylococcus Aureus in 91 percent of them. We also examined nine handpiece lines from these 23 offices and found growth of pathogens in 78 percent of them. Correlation of the growth found in the handpiece lines and the growth found in the air pressure tanks needs further study to determine if an interrelationship exists between these two areas of contamination. However, contamination does exist in both areas and these areas deliver contaminated air under pressure to the oral environment. We need to consider mechanisms for filter entrapment or sterilization of these pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout Japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (CPM), its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Microbial strains in which no CPM-resistant strains emerged were Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. 2. In comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to CPM were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to CPM was observed in high ratios. 3. Among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that CPM could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "CPM-resistant strains". 4. It was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including CPM. 5. There are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of CPM to clinically isolated strains in recent years. However, it was jointly confirmed that CPM maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. Furthermore, when it was additionally considered that CPM was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that CPM was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 5-acylaminothiazole derivatives, synthetic drugs related to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Newly synthesized 5-acylaminothiazolium salts and one 5-acylaminothiazolidine, considering their chemical structure and reactivity, have been proposed as potential inhibitors of bacterial serine DD-peptidases. A moderate antibiotic activity with (5-phenylacetylamino-3-thiazolio)acetate and (5-phenylacetylaminothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid was observed on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The methyl- and tert-butyl esters of the thiazolium salt have shown lower MIC values. Moreover, when introduced into an exponential growth phase culture of S. aureus, the three active thiazolium salts induced a partial lysis indicating an impairing of the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The observed time-dependent binding of the best compound to the PBPs of S. aureus was too slow and occurred at too high concentrations to account for its MIC value. Consequently, the antibiotic activity of the thiazolium salts on the S. aureus cells seems not to be satisfactorily explained by a penicillin-like interaction with the PBPs.
TI  - Bacteriology of community acquired urinary tract infection. Analysis of 1048 cases.
AB  - Urine samples from 1048 cases clinically suspected to have urinary tract infection were examined for bacteriological culture and antibiotic sensitivity. Of 1048 cultures, 530 (50.5%) were sterile, 163 (15.5%) showed the presence of nonpathogenic bacteria and 11 (1%) revealed nonsignificant bacteriuria with Escherichia coli. Significant bacteriuria (more than 10(5)/ml) was found in the remaining 344 (32.8%) cases. Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from 170 (16.2%) samples; Klebsiella aerogenes was the next in order, found in 46 (4.3%) cases. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 37 (3.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 29 (2.7%), Proteus mirabilis in 26 (2.4%), Streptococcus faecalis in 21 (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (1%) and Citrobacter freundii in 3 cases. Nalidixic acid was the most effective drug against gram negative organisms. Nitrofurantoin was the next antibiotic of choice, whereas cephalexin was the third drug in order of sensitivity. Ampicillin was the first drug of choice in infection with gram positive cocci, followed by nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cephalexin and cephaloridine. The results of sensitivity tests emphasise the problem of multiple drug resistance in our community.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - [Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: occurrence in chronic liver disease patients  in Recife].
AB  - A prospective research was made on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in chronic liver disease patients presenting with ascites. Forty clinical cases, of 37 patients, were analysed. All subjects were submitted to clinical and laboratory evaluation and diagnostic paracentesis, and the material was obtained for biochemical dosages, pH determination, cytology and bacterial cultures. Thirty cases of sterile ascites and 10 of SBP (25%) were detected. In 5 (50%) with SBP, the clinical findings were characteristic, with fever, abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. In 2 patients (20%) the presentation was atypical, without the complete triad described above. Finally in 3 (30%) SBP was silent, without any suggestive clinical manifestations of infection. In 7 cases (70%) cultures were positives; Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 cases), Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus negative coagulase, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). In 7 (70%) SBP cases, the patients were admitted already infected in the hospital. Lethality in the SBP group was 30% and in the sterile ascites was 13.3%. We concluded that SBP is a frequent cause of morbid-lethality in patients with ascites and chronic hepatopathy, presenting itself often in a typical clinical manifestations.
TI  - Synthesis of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes of Ceclor (cefaclor) and preliminary experiments on their antibacterial character.
AB  - Cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes of the antibacterial drug Ceclor have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of their elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic moment and electronic and infrared spectral data. These complex have been, then subjected to screening for their antibacterial properties against bacterial species such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In comparison to uncomplexed Ceclor, the metal complexes have been shown to be more antibacterial.
TI  - Comparative efficacy and safety of cefprozil (BMY-28100) and cefaclor in the treatment of acute group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis.
AB  - Cefprozil (BMY-28100) is a semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and prolonged serum elimination half-life allowing for once-a-day oral administration. In vitro, cefprozil demonstrates excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefprozil (500 mg once daily) was compared to cefaclor (250 mg three times daily) in an open, randomized, comparative trial for the treatment of acute group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Ninety-four patients were enrolled in this study; 53 patients were evaluable for clinical and bacteriological response assessment. Seventy-eight patients were evaluable for safety assessment. Three patients (all in the cefprozil treatment group) required disenrollment because of side effects, mainly nausea. Clinical and bacteriological responses were comparable for both study drugs. Leukopenia and nausea, the most common side effects observed, were more common in the cefprozil-treated group. Cefprozil appears to be an appropriate alternative to cefaclor for the treatment of acute group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. However, because of the small number of patients eligible for efficacy assessment, a large type II (beta) error was expected in our study, which may have resulted in a potential failure to detect a difference between both treatment groups. A larger study would be required to determine the proper role of cefprozil in the treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections.
TI  - Streptococcus group A pneumonia in an intravenous drug misuser (IVDM).
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes appears to have become an uncommon cause of pneumonia. In  view of the recent increase in S. pyogenes infections this situation is likely to change. An intravenous drug user presented with acute onset of fever and chills. At presentation pleuritic chest pain was a prominent symptom, and later he developed pulmonary abscesses and an empyema. The patient had a good response to benzyl penicillin, and his pulmonary lesions resolved completely. Although his clinical picture was characteristic of S. pyogenes pneumonia, it could easily be mistaken for Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopy of Fc receptors on the surface of clinical isolates of  streptococci.
AB  - The distribution of Fc receptors on the surface of clinical isolates of streptococci was examined by immunoelectron microscopy. A unique two-layered ferritin tagging was observed on the surface of isolate MS-4 (group A). The spacing between the layers (10-40 nm) was narrower than that of the layered protein A (30-70 nm) on Staphylococcus aureus. Labeling on the other isolates, IP-28 (group A) and ES-21L (group C), showed similar rough layers, but the labeling were clearly different in thickness and density. The labeling on isolate IP-28 was also similar to that on strain AR1 (group A), reported previously, while the labeling on ES-21L was similar to that on protein G producing strain G148 (group G) in thickness. However, it was obviously thinner than that on IP-28 and AR1. These results strongly suggest that there are at least three distribution patterns of Fc receptors on streptococci, and these are distinct from that of protein A.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - Medical and microbiological problems arising from airborne infection in hospitals.
AB  - The practical importance and frequency of airborne nosocomial infections has been a matter of dispute for many years. This is because most of the pathogens acquired in hospitals are able to use various different routes of infecting the patient's body so that it may be difficult or even impossible to prove an individual infection to be airborne. Only microbes such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or certain respiratory viruses that are known to be predominantly transmitted by droplet infection from infected persons or healthy carriers, have been accepted to the cause of airborne nosocomial infections. Other pathogens such as legionellae, pseudomonads or clostridia may be distributed in the hospital environment via an insufficient or defective air-conditioning system, with or without humidification. The assessment of indirect airborne infections caused by infective particles derived from dust which has settled on furniture or the floor or which has been introduced to the hospital environment by shoes, open windows, building works or potted indoor plants is much more difficult. Many Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, mycobacteria, nocardiae, and endospores of clostridia and bacilli, as well as the reproductive elements of fungi do remain viable and infective in dry dust and may therefore infect patients when the dust is disturbed. In contrast to nosocomial infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, against which most preventive measures have been concentrated in the past and which are usually not airborne in origin, it appears that the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of hospital pathogens by air has been underestimated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Possible role of Streptococcus pyogenes in mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. XI. Immunoelectron microscopic observation of protoplast-like "spherical bodies" detected in peripheral blood of MCLS patients.
AB  - Protoplast-like "spherical bodies" averaging 0.5-1.5 microns in diameter and devoid of cell walls were first detected by Ueno et al, in the buffy coat of heparinized venous blood from patients with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS). But the nature of the "bodies" has yet to be clarified because of the absence of convincing evidence pointing to their antigenic characteristics. The present investigations were designed solely to provide a serological identification of the "bodies" by the use of immunoelectron microscopy, with the following results. First, "spherical bodies" bearing a striking resemblance to those observed by the above-mentioned authors were detected in biopsy specimens from challenge sites in mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes as well as in the buffy coat of peripheral blood from MCLS patients. Second, the "bodies" detected were stained distinctly in both cases by an immunohistochemical technique using, as the primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum raised toward S. pyogenes-derived protoplasts, which was then absorbed with protoplasts from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Third, the absorbed sera were proved to be not faultless, because complete specificity toward protoplasts from S. pyogenes was not attained due to the presence of a large amount of cross-reactive antigens between protoplasts from the immunizing and absorbing strains of bacteria. The implications of these findings are discussed, particularly in relation to the evaluation of the present serological test for the "spherical bodies".

TI  - Abscesses of the neck in infants and young children. A review of 112 cases.
AB  - A review of 112 patients 5 years of age and younger with cervical abscesses is reported. Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were cultured most often: in 39% and 17% of patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (14%) had unusual abscesses such as infected congenital cysts, cat-scratch disease, or myocobacterial abscesses. One patient had a necrotizing infection with group A streptococci and anaerobic streptococci. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was used in 104 patients, with 94% of these patients receiving a penicillin derivative, usually an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Ninety-six percent of the patients had incision and drainage of their abscesses; 8 patients required more than one incision and drainage. Two patients required airway intervention, 1 by intubation and 1 by trachetomy. Most pediatric cervical abscesses respond well to appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage.
TI  - Microbial aetiology of otitis externa.
AB  - Microbiological samples were collected from the ears of patients with otitis externa for a period of 1 year. Altogether, 226 evaluable samples from 104 males and 122 females were received. The age range of the patients was similar to that of the Norwegian population. A wide variety of bacteria and fungi was isolated. The commonest isolates, excluding normal flora, were Staphylococcus aureus (34.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.1%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (8.8%); 9.3% samples contained fungi. Of all samples, 15% showed a mixture of Gram-positive and Gram-negative, potentially pathogenic, bacteria. Infection due to Gram-negative organisms alone was commoner in males, while the lack of any obvious microbial aetiology was more frequent in females. Isolation of S. aureus together with S. pyogenes was common but that of S. aureus together with S. pyogenes was common but that of S. aureus together with P. aeruginosa was unusual. In treated patients, the finding of streptococci and S. aureus was rare whereas that of P. aeruginosa or absence of growth was common. Otitis externa involving Gram-positive bacteria seems to be more prevalent in our area than in that of other reported studies.
TI  - Bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in Sweden.
AB  - Bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in Sweden. Streptococci, e.g. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. Bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). When the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, May 15 to October 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). These figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. Whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of A. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. There were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas Str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. This and other Swedish investigations support the theory that A. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on Str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. It is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.
TI  - Studies on beta-lactam antibiotics. III. Syntheses and antibacterial activities of new 3-(1,3-dithiolan-2-yl)cephalosporins, YM-22508, YM-16457 and their prodrug-type esters.
AB  - The syntheses and biological activities of new 7-beta-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-hydroxy-iminoacetamido]-3-(1 ,3- dithiolan-2-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (YM-22508, 1a), 7-beta-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1,3-dithiolan-2-yl)-3-cephem-4-carboxyli c acid (YM-16457, 1d) and their prodrug-type esters are described. Among them, YM-22561 (1c), the 1-acetoxyethyl ester of 1a, showed good in vivo efficacy in mice against infections of Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Streptococcus pyogenes S 23 and Escherichia coli NY-17 and a long plasma T1/2 in mice.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem  developed by Hoechst AG and Roussel Uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. Against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to those of cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to that of CTX, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. Especially against Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. Although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by Salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. Bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of Salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). Especially S. pneumoniae in 10 cases, H. influenzae in 12 cases and B. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. Adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). Eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. As digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. In laboratory test values, elevation of GOT, elevation of GPT, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. No change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. From above results, we have concluded that CDZM is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was less active than ciprofloxacin but more active than ofloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was less active than ciprofloxacin but twofold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and most Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates at 0.25 micrograms/ml, whereas ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited these isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Sparfloxacin was less active at an acidic pH and in the presence of Mg2+. Resistance to sparfloxacin was produced by repeated exposure, although the frequency of single-step mutants was less than 10(-9).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. MICs for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bordetella pertussis. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively. When administered orally in mouse protection tests against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes, temafloxacin was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin. Against H. influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice. In treating L. pneumophila in guinea pigs and H. influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin. Against S. pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin. Following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - Thirty-four aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses that were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. A total 107 bacterial isolates (58 anaerobic and 49 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 3.1 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 1.4 aerobic and facultatives). Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (18%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 2 (6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 26 (76%). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 4 infections, 2 of which were Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 were anaerobic bacteria. The predominant bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), Bacteroides sp (21 isolates, including 15 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp (16) and S. pyogenes (10). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 13 (52%) of 25 specimens tested. This retrospective study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - Modifications of plasma fibronectin in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Recurrent pulmonary infections with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major problem in cystic fibrosis (CF), leading to severe and progressive deterioration of the respiratory tract. Fibronectin (FN) has a binding site(s) for S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This bacterial bindings site(s) was studied by using FN from patients with CF and comparing them with FN purified from the plasma of bronchitis and normal subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. We found a decreased binding of the CF FN to these bacteria in all seven CF patients. Other differences between the CF FN and normal FN were a marked modification in the pattern of peptide migration in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after hydrolysis with various proteinases and an increase or decrease of the total sugar content of the FN.
TI  - Fluid replacement protection of rabbits challenged subcutaneous with toxic shock  syndrome toxins.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPE A) belong to a family of pyrogenic toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. Both toxins are responsible for causing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and related illnesses, clinically characterized by multiorgan involvement. The most severe TSS symptom is acute hypotension and shock after the initial febrile response. In this study, we examined possible mechanisms of shock development in TSS, particularly the role of T-cell proliferation, endotoxin enhancement by toxins, and capillary leakage. American Dutch belted rabbits, with subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps filled with either TSST-1 or SPE A, served as the animal model. For both TSST-1 and SPE A-treated rabbits, administration of cyclosporin A prevented toxin-induced T-cell proliferation but failed to protect the rabbits. Polymyxin B treatment of rabbits, to neutralize endogenous endotoxin, partially protected rabbits from challenge with either exotoxin; two of six rabbits survived on day 2 when treated with only TSST-1, whereas six of six animals survived after challenge with TSST-1 and polymyxin B. Similarly, with SPE A-treated rabbits, only 1 of 10 animals without polymyxin B treatment survived on day 8, but 4 of 6 rabbits survived on day 8 when given polymyxin B. Fluid replacement was successful in preventing lethality. Twelve of 14 rabbits survived when given TSST-1 with fluid, and all rabbits treated with SPE A and fluid survived. Finally, by using miniosmotic pumps, staphylococcal exfoliative toxin A and concanavalin A were administered to rabbits in an attempt to induce lethality. These two T-cell mitogens caused T-cell proliferation but failed to induce lethality in rabbits. The data suggest that toxin interactions causing vascular leakage and to some extent endotoxin enhancement are of major importance in development of hypotension and shock in TSS. It appears that T-cell proliferation may not contribute significantly to the induction of shock and death.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826 compared to other glycopeptides and daptomycin.
AB  - LY264826 a new naturally occurring glycopeptide inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus at 1 micrograms/ml. LY264826 had similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. The LY264826 MIC90 for Streptococcus pyogenes was 0.25 microgram/ml, twofold more active than vancomycin and twofold less active than teicoplanin. LY264826 was eightfold more active than vancomycin and twofold more active than teicoplanin against enterococci. LY264826 inhibited Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 microgram/ml and Listeria monocytogenes at 0.5 microgram/ml. Clostridium were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml of LY264826 and peptococci, peptostreptococci, and Fusobacterium were inhibited by less than 0.5 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species were LY284826 -resistant as were all Enterobacteriaceae, Flavobacterium, and Neisseria spp. Minimum bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations (MBCs and MICs) were within a dilution for S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, but greater than or equal to 32-fold greater for enterococci.
TI  - [Stimulation of the immune system by microbial "superantigens"].
AB  - The enterotoxins and the toxic-shock-syndrome toxin-1 of Staphylococcus aureus, the erythrogenic toxins of Streptococcus pyogenes as well as a still uncharacterized exoprotein of Mycoplasma arthritidis belong to a family of exotoxins, that have in common a potent mitogenic activity for T lymphocytes of several species. These proteins stimulate CD4(+)- and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by cross-linking the T-cell-antigen receptor with MHC-class-II molecules on accessory or target cells. They are functionally bivalent molecules having distinct interaction sites for variable parts of the T-cell receptor and for nonpolymorphic parts of MHC-class-II molecules. Due to their preferential action on T cells expressing certain V beta-parts of the T-cell receptor the designation "superantigens" has been proposed. The mechanism of T-cell stimulation has apparently been conserved in evolution and has been adapted to the host's T-cell-receptor repertoire. The T cells stimulating activity apparently contributes to the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases. Noteworthy, mice express endogenous "superantigens" that have similar properties.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Plants used in Guatemala for the treatment of respiratory diseases. 1. Screening  of 68 plants against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Respiratory ailments are important causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Ethnobotanical surveys and literature reviews conducted in Guatemala during 1986-88 showed that 234 plants from 75 families, most of them of American origin, have been used for the treatment of respiratory ailments. Three Gram-positive bacteria causing respiratory infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) were used to screen 68 of the most commonly used plants for activity. Twenty-eight of these (41.2%) inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria tested. Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by 18 of the plant extracts, while 7 extracts were effective against Streptococcus pyogenes. Plants of American origin which exhibited antibacterial activity were: Gnaphalium viscosum, Lippia alba, Lippia dulcis, Physalis philadelphica, Satureja brownei, Solanum nigrescens and Tagetes lucida. These preliminary in vitro results provide scientific basis for the use of these plants against bacterial respiratory infections.
TI  - Nonsporulating bacterial species contain DNA sequences homologous to the Bacillus spore-specific C-protein gene.
AB  - Genes for small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs) are ubiquitous among the spore-forming bacteria and are expressed only during sporulation. Although they perform the function of amino acid storage in spores, the members of the SASP-C multigene family probably serve additional functions, so that similar sequences might be present in non-spore-formers. Using the SASP-C gene (ssp-c) as a hybridization probe, restriction digests of whole genomic DNA from seven nonsporulating bacterial species were examined for similar sequences. Hybridization was found in four species: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria sicca, and Mycobacterium phlei, indicating the presence of similar sequences in some, but not all, of the non-spore-formers. In each of these positive species, multiple bands hybridized. A 4.5-kb hybridizing fragment from S. pyogenes and a 9.0-kb hybridizing fragment from M. phlei have been cloned and partially sequenced. These fragments show substantial DNA sequence homology to ssp-c and their deduced amino acid sequences show substantial homology to SASP-C.
TI  - Antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  - The discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of Bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin O of Streptococcus pyogenes. Exposure to these bacteria to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. However, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. By way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of S. aureus expressing protein A, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. In particular it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein A either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. Extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.
TI  - Eyelid necrosis and periorbital necrotizing fasciitis. Report of a case and review of the literature.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon and severe soft tissue infection characterized by cutaneous gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and vascular thrombosis. The disease is usually preceded by trauma in patients that have systemic problems, most commonly diabetes and alcoholism. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent bacterial etiologies; however, combinations of numerous facultative and anaerobic organisms have also been isolated. Involvement of the face and periocular region is rare. A case is presented here, as well as a review of the clinical features of 15 other patients previously described, in whom eyelid necrosis due to periorbital necrotizing fasciitis developed. Early surgical debridement and drainage of necrotic tissues and appropriate parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy. The mortality rate in patients with periorbital spread was 12.5%, with the prognosis known to be adversely affected by delay in diagnosis and treatment and/or extension of infection from the face to the neck. Reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts was necessary in most cases to avoid such complications as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malpositions, and lagophthalmos.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - Characteristics of group A streptococcal bacteremia in patients at the San Bernardino County Medical Center.
AB  - On the basis of a 12-year study of 58 patients at our medical center who had group A streptococcal bacteremia, we found that this disease is not uncommon when compared with other varieties of bacteremia. It occurs with about one-half of the frequency of bacteremias due to Klebsiella species and one-eighth of that of bacteremias due to Staphylococcus aureus. The infection is infrequently nosocomial (3.5% of cases) and the predominant causes are cutaneous or subcutaneous infections (72% of cases). While many patients are chronically ill, debilitated, or elderly, in our institution, as in some other public hospitals, the most important underlying condition is a history of iv drug abuse (28% of cases). Our data and those of some other recent publications suggest that the occurrence of cases related to iv drug abuse may be increasing. Intravenous drug abusers tend to be young adults, while other sources of infection are found more frequently in older patients. The frequent presence (10.3% of cases) of other organisms (especially S. aureus) in the blood of patients with group A streptococcal bacteremia has not been sufficiently emphasized in previous studies.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - [Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis due to ordinary germs in children with closed injuries. Study of a series of 44 cases].
AB  - The retrospective study of a series of 44 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in infants and children has shown that 16 out of the 44 patients (36%) have a history of previous trauma at the site of bone infection. Seven infants were less than one year of age. For the remaining 37 children the incidence of previous local trauma rose to 43% (16/37). This incidence is similar to that in previous studies. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis follows blood-borne spread of a pathogen from a portal of entry. Why hematogenous infection selects a particular bone is an enigma. Trauma has been said to predispose to the localization of infection but the association between trauma and hematogenous osteomyelitis is only found in one-third of the cases in both this study and in previous series. However these cases with a history of local trauma raise questions regarding the concept of "locus minoris resistentiae" and its medicolegal consequences.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - [Biocompatibility studies of periodontal dressings].
AB  - Periodontal packs have to be considered medications due to their direct contact to the gums and wound surfaces. For this reason a high cell biological compatibility has to be considered as one of their most important properties. For this reason, the cytotoxicity of all periodontal packs commonly used in Germany was examined, using the "Erlangen Ciliate Test". This method, which is commonly used to determine the cytotoxic and cytostatic properties of a wide variety of different materials and substances, is based on liquid cultures of the eucaryotic organism "Tetrahymena piriformis", using an excellent correlation with mammalian or human tissue cultures as well as the LD50. A significant toxicity of up to 50% could be shown in all but one periodontal pack. In addition, the antibacterial properties of the same materials were examined, using liquid cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and hemolyzing streptococci group A. However, using this method, no significant antibacterial effects could be shown.

TI  - Clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil in the treatment of patients with primary infections of the skin or skin structures.
AB  - This study was designed to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of three oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections of the skin or skin structures. A total of 330 patients were enrolled at 10 centers and were randomly assigned to receive cefuroxime axetil 250 mg (n = 107), cephalexin 500 mg (n = 111) or cefadroxil 500 mg (n = 112), twice daily for 10 days. Patients were assessed for their clinical and bacteriological responses once during treatment (3-5 days) and twice after treatment (1-3 and 10-14 days). A total of 353 bacterial isolates were obtained: Staphylococcus aureus (41%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (33%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (5%). A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 97% (89/92), 89% (80/90) and 94% (82/87) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin or cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.047, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). With respect to the eradication of the bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure or presumed cure) was obtained in 96% (69/72), 85% (60/71) and 93% (63/68) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.026, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). All three study drugs were well tolerated, with adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal system most commonly reported. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of drug-related adverse events.
TI  - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  - Some studies suggest a potential role for bacterial respiratory tract infections  in the development of bronchospasm and the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis have exaggerated airway reactivity; croup in children can also cause exaggerated upper and lower airway responsiveness. Bronchial obstruction after inhalation of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacteria has been reported. Between January 1989 and June 1990 we and two other centers studied 193 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of asthma. Fifty-two (27%) of these patients had bacteria in their sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and H influenzae were the most commonly isolated bacterial species. Antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of infective lung disease, not only by killing bacteria but also by preventing increases in bacterial histamine levels within the lung airways. Moreover, an antibiotic of proven efficacy can reduce airway reactivity in patients with bacterial exacerbations of COPD or bronchial asthma. In 12 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of asthma and high airway reactivity to methacholine, a ten-day course of treatment with cefaclor and existing bronchodilators induced microbiologic cure and a slight but nonsignificant change in airway reactivity in nine patients. Antibiotic therapy has a minor but clear role in the control of acquired bronchial hyperreactivity during bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic patients; however, because of airway inflammation, an antibiotic's efficacy is evident only when the inflammatory process subsides. Approaches designed to minimize airway reactivity may contribute to the prevention or reversal of respiratory failure during exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of three glycols, - propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol - against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Streptococcus mitis, and E. coli were studied in vitro. Within 20 h, 10% and 30% hexylene glycol in fresh tryptic soy broth were able to kill all the micro-organisms listed above. Five percent hexylene glycol showed some antimicrobial properties but the 1% agent had no effect. Thirty percent 1,3-butylene glycol and 30% propylene glycol were approximately as effective as 10% HG. The results speak in favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and dermatological vehicles instead of propylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and six reference antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was assessed against 234 gram-positive bacterial isolates by agar dilution (10(4) CFU/spot). Sparfloxacin activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and five other antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 0.125-0.25 mg/l). Sparfloxacin was also the most active drug tested against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 mg/l) and showed equal activity against gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant (MIC greater than 2,000 mg/l) enterococci. Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (MIC90, 1 mg/l). Most Corynebacterium jeikeium showed exquisite susceptibility to sparfloxacin (MIC, 0.06-0.25 mg/l). For MRSA, time-kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal at the MIC of the organism. Sparfloxacin showed greater and more sustained bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin at 1x and 2x the MIC. Reduction in the activity of sparfloxacin occurred with decreased agar pH (from 7.0 to 6.0) and increased bacterial inoculum. Sparfloxacin showed superior activity compared to reference drugs against most gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - Controversies in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis.
AB  - An increasing number of cases of sore throat caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci occur with concomitant colonization by organisms that may "protect" the streptococci through beta-lactamase inactivation of penicillin at the site of infection. The failure of penicillin to eradicate many of these bacteria, which include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and a multitude of pharyngeal anaerobes, may help to explain why penicillin is sometimes ineffective for acute and recurrent group A streptococcal infections. Therapeutic alternatives currently include cephalosporins, erythromycin, rifampin combined with penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and others.
TI  - [Study on susceptibilities of freshly isolated strains to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  - Macrolide (ML) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ML-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. The distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MLs against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak representing S. aureus isolates susceptible to MLs and the other peak representing those resistant to MLs. Proportions of resistant isolates to various MLs were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. MICs of rokitamycin (RKM), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). Staphylococcus spp. including Staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring MLs and to 16-membered ring MLs. Further, the proportion of resistant organisms to RKM was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring MLs tested. These differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different MLs may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different MLs. The above described ratios of resistant organisms to MLs among S. aureus did not vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. Four per cent (4%) of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were MLs resistant, and 18% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to MLs. Among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of S. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of S. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - [Diagnosis of bacterial allergy in patients with diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses].
AB  - A comprehensive allergological examinations of 92 patients with lesions of the nose and paranasal cavities and 20 essentially healthy subjects was carried out, using skin tests and neutrophil tests. Half of the patients showed sensitization to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes allergens, which occurred more frequently in patients with chronic purulent sinusitis. It is recommended to expose such patients to allergological examinations and to prescribe, if indicated, desensitization therapy.
TI  - Target cell lysis and IL-2 secretion by gamma/delta T lymphocytes after activation with bacteria.
AB  - Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from healthy donors were stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and afterward analyzed phenotypically. Marked expansion of the gamma/delta T cell population (3- to 21-fold) was observed in 15/21 donors 7 to 10 days after stimulation. In addition to M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae (six of eight) as well as the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (two of six), group A streptococci (seven of nine), and Listeria monocytogenes (four of eight) augmented gamma/delta TCR expression in peripheral blood T cells of many donors. gamma/delta T lymphocytes expressed IL-2R and secreted IL-2 upon restimulation with M. tuberculosis. Stimulation with M. tuberculosis evoked specific cytolytic activities in gamma/delta T lymphocytes because: gamma/delta T cells lysed M. tuberculosis pulsed but not unpulsed targets; high concentrations of TCR delta 1 mAb facilitated killing of unpulsed target cells; and low doses of anti-TCR delta 1 mAb blocked killing of pulsed targets. Furthermore, gamma/delta T cells from four donors, after activation with M. tuberculosis or with group A streptococci, respectively, only lysed targets pulsed with the homologous agents, whereas in other donors some cross-reactivity was observed. We conclude that, upon contact with mycobacteria and perhaps other microorganisms, gamma/delta T cells are activated which contribute to immunity against infection via IL-2 secretion and specific target cell lysis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal activity of pentamidine.
AB  - Pentamidine isethionate was bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Candida albicans. S. aureus was inhibited by concentrations of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml and killed by 64 to greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcal killing was consistently greater in the presence of cations and was unaffected by methicillin resistance.
TI  - Changes in tonsillar bacteriology of recurrent acute tonsillitis: 1980 vs. 1989.
AB  - Recurrent acute tonsillitis is a common problem. Despite this, there still remain many controversies regarding aetiology and correct management. The tonsillar microflora of 33 children with recurrent acute tonsillitis studied in 1980 and 58 patients studied in 1989 is presented. A comparison of the microbiology in the two periods studied a decade apart suggests that the pathogenic profile is changing. Haemophilus influenzae increased from 39 to 62% in the deep tonsillar tissue in the decade. There was a concomitant increase in incidence of Staphylococcus aureus from 6 to 40% of cases. In the same interval, mixed microflora increased from 18 to 52%. Anaerobic organisms were isolated in insignificant numbers. Unique to this study, 44% of H. influenzae isolates in 1989 were beta lactamase producers, increasing from only 2% in 1980. All of the S. aureus were beta lactamase producers. In the majority, the throat swabs grew only organisms commensal to the upper respiratory tract however, the deep tonsillar tissue excised at tonsillectomy carried significant growths of pathogenic organisms confirming the inadequacy of the superficial tonsillar swab as an indicator of treatment.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Regulation of human monocyte/macrophage function by extracellular matrix. Adherence of monocytes to collagen matrices enhances phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by activation of complement receptors and enhancement of Fc receptor function.
AB  - In inflammation monocytes emigrate from the peripheral circulation into an extravascular area rich in extracellular matrix proteins. In this milieu, phagocytes ingest and kill invading pathogens. In the present studies, we found that monocytes adhered to type I collagen gels phagocytized 2.5-12-fold more opsonized Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae than plastic-adherent monocytes. The rate of phagocytosis and the number of bacteria ingested by collagen-adherent monocytes was equal to, or greater than, the number of bacteria ingested by 7-d cultured macrophages (M phi). Although both collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes were bactericidal for E. coli and S. aureus, more bacteria were killed by collagen-adherent monocytes by virtue of their enhanced phagocytic capacity. Cultured M phi only were bacteriostatic. Adherence of monocytes to collagen gels activated C receptors (CR) types 1 and 3 for phagocytosis, and enhanced Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis. Collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes produced equivalent amounts of superoxide anion in response to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan. Thus, the enhanced phagocytosis and killing of opsonized bacteria by collagen-adherent monocytes appear to be by regulation of the function of membrane CR and FcR, without apparent enhancement of the respiratory burst. These data suggest that adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix during inflammation may rapidly activate these cells for enhanced phagocytic bactericidal activity.
TI  - Comparative study on the macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin: antibacterial activity and influence on immune responses.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin (a new macrolide antibiotic) on clinical bacterial isolates as well as their effects on the cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c-mice and on human granulocytes/monocytes was investigated. Treatment of BALB/c-mice for 7 days with these drugs did not influence the delayed type hypersensitivity to oxazolone nor the production of IgG and IgM immunoglobulins. In vitro, exposure of granulocytes to erythromycin resulted in increased phagocytosis only in higher concentrations (20 mcg/ml), whereas clarithromycin enhanced chemiluminescence response of granulocytes in concentrations ranging from 2.5-20 mcg/ml. Subinhibitory concentrations of both substances modified Staphylococcus aureus and made them more susceptible for granulocyte phagocytosis.
TI  - A case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis.
AB  - The group B streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Group B streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. We report here an unusual case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis. Pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally, Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. Diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. The response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. This report describes a diabetic patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.
TI  - Studies on antibacterial agents. II. Synthesis and antibacterial activities of substituted 1,2-dihydro-6-oxo-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of substituted 1,2-dihydro-6-oxo-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acids for the treatment of systemic infections was synthesized via 7-bromo-3-ethylthio-4,5-difluoro-2-methylindole (3), which was prepared by Gassman's indole synthesis in excellent yield. The synthesized pyrroloquinolines were tested for their antibacterial activities. 8-Fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-methyl-9-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-6-oxo-6H- pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acid showed a potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of dirithromycin (LY 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Dirithromycin inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. Group A streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. Erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. For Haemophilus influenzae, MICs were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. The activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of copper-amino acid complexes.
AB  - Copper complexes of L-alanine, L-arginine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-proline and L-threonine were studied for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia Coli. The complexes of 1-alanine, 1-proline and 1-threonine were nearly as active as ampicillin against Strep. Pyogenes. Mixed complexes of these amino acids showed similar effect. Other complexes were also active to a significant extent against all the three strains studied.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of new oxime type of beta-lactam antibiotics].
AB  - The antibacterial efficacy of two novel beta-lactam antibiotics of the oxime type, VUFB 16265 and 16272, was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in 47 clinical strains and 6 standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter and Proteus spec., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which were the most frequent causes of infectious complications. The results were compared with the MIC of cefalexin, cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefsulodin, and ampicillin. The antibacterial activity of both VUFB drugs was comparable with the efficacy of the antibiotics tested. Only in the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa the activity of all antibiotics under evaluation was low and only cefsulodin was effective.
TI  - [In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activity of the original oxime type of beta-lactam antibiotics with the 4-aminobenzensulfonamide group].
AB  - Four newly prepared beta-lactam antibiotics of the oxime type with a 4-aminobenzensulphonamidogroup, synthetized at the Research Institute for Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Prague, were subjected to an evaluation of antibacterial efficacy in vitro. The evaluation was carried out by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in 47 clinical strains and 6 standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and facecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter and Proteus spec., Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The results were compared with the MIC of cefalexin, cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefsulodin, and ampicillin. The antibacterial effect of these agents was lower than that of the compared antibiotics. It was slightly better in the pseudomonadic strains, where the efficacy of cefusulodin was best and the other four antibiotics appeared to be worst.
TI  - Studies on antibacterial agents. III. Synthesis and antibacterial activities of substituted 1,4-dihydro-8-methyl-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of substituted 4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids having a methyl group at the 8-position was prepared and tested for their antibacterial activity. 7-(trans-3-Amino-4-methyl-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-cyclopropyl-1,4-dihydro-6- fluoro-8-methyl-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (21) exhibited highly potent antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [A clinical evaluation of cefdinir in pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefdinir (CFDN), a new oral cephalosporin, was administered to 10 patients with various infections and the following results were obtained. 1. Clinical responses in 10 patients (1 patient with rhinitis, 2 with sinusitis, 1 with pharyngitis, 1 with tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever and 1 with abscess) were excellent in 6 and good in 4 with an efficacy rate of 100%. 2. Eleven species of bacteria were isolated (3 of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 of Haemophilus influenzae) and all of them were eradicated by the treatment with CFDN. 3. No side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were noted. None of the patients refused to take the drug.
TI  - [Annual changes in susceptibility of clinical isolates to midecamycin acetate].
AB  - To investigate annual changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to midecamycin acetate (MDM-AC), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MDM-AC were determined for clinical isolates obtained from outpatients since 1985. MDM-AC-resistant strains of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. have shown similar degrees of resistance to midecamycin and josamycin. Regarding this as macrolide resistance, proportions of macrolide-resistant strains tended to increase for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae but to decrease for Streptococcus pyogenes. 1. For S. aureus, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 20% in 1987 and 20% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant. Of these macrolide-resistant strains, 70% or more in 1987 and 80% or more in 1989 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). 2. For S. pneumoniae, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 12% in 1987 and 12% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant, indicating a tendency for resistant strains to increase annually. 3. For S. pyogenes, 8% of the strains isolated in 1985, 4% in 1987 and 0% in 1989 were macrolide-resistant, showing a decreasing tendency. 4. MDM-AC is still thought to be a clinically useful antibacterial agent because it still shows antibacterial activity against 80% or more of Gram-positive cocci clinically isolated in recent years and a low degree of induction of macrolide resistance in Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - Cardiovascular infections: bacterial endocarditis of oral origin. Pathogenesis and prophylaxis.
AB  - The diagnosis infective endocarditis describes infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and indicates the presence of micro-organisms in the lesion. In most cases, the heart valves are affected, but the disease can also occur on septal defects or on the mural endocardium. The disease has been classified as acute or subacute based on the progression of the untreated disease. The acute form has a fulminant course with high fever and leukocytosis with death in less than 6 weeks. It is most often associated with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes. The subacute (death within 6 weeks to 3 months) and chronic (death more than 3 months) forms are mostly described together. These forms usually occur in patients with prior valvular disease and are characterized by a slow, indolent course with low-grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss. This form is usually caused by the viridansstreptococci. The above mentioned classification does not include the nonbacterial forms of endocarditis and enterococci often give rise to a disease intermediate between acute and subacute endocarditis. It is preferable to have a classification based on the micro-organism responsible since this classification has implications for the course followed and the appropriate antimicrobial agent to use. The clinical manifestations of the disease are so varied that they may be encountered in most medical subspecialities. Successful management is also dependent on the close cooperation of medical and dental disciplines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Quantitative study of wound infection in irradiated mice.
AB  - Bacterial infection of simple wounds was studied directly and quantitatively in adult mice given 6.5 Gy 60Co. Three days later, when neutropenia was evident, the skin and the medial gluteus muscle of anaesthetized mice were incised. A suspension of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes was inoculated into the wound. Bacteria per mg muscle were enumerated 3, 4 or 7 days later. The geometric means of bacteria per mg were greater in irradiated than in non-irradiated mice. Phagocytic cells were present in the wounded tissue. Hence sublethal ionizing radiation enhanced the susceptibility of mice to infections of wounds by these four bacterial species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
AB  - Twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. Fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against Streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, Corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and Pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. Only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. Antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of Phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. Strains of Klebsiella spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. While for Esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--Staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. The lower doses showed stepwise lower activities. Apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like SHV 2 or TEM 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in Esch. coli and H. influenzae did not affect the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. The results show that cefpodoxime was more active against Gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.
TI  - A54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  - A54145 complex is made up of eight factors; A, A1, B, B1, C, D, E, and F which were active in vitro (MIC 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against Gram-positive aerobic organisms. The complex, factor B and B1 were found to be active against two strains of Clostridium perfringens. A calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. Resistance build-up was seen when Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of A54145 antibiotics. This resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. Factor A was very effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ED50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). Factor B was more active against S. pyogenes in vivo (sc ED50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). Acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. Semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.
TI  - [Studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of Staphylococcus aureus L-form].
AB  - Metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-S. aureus L-form serum and anti-S. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of S. aureus L-form and its coccal form, respectively. These activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Actinomyces viscosus. These findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. The membrane antigens of L-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. A large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of L-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). A fractionation study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.
TI  - [Clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. They were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. CETB was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 to 14 days. Especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. A total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii were identified from sputa before administration. All of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: Responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. There was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. From the avobe results, it is concluded that CETB is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem on acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  - The acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. The treatment of this disease is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. The activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. These strains were: 112 strains of H. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of S. aureus; 14 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, and 32 strains of corynebacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. The MICs of cefuroxime against H. influenzae were low and similar (MIC 50 = 1 mg/l; MIC 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. Overall, 90% and 98% of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. These results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - Use of mupirocin ointment in the treatment of secondarily infected dermatoses.
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2% mupirocin ointment in the treatment of secondarily infected dermatoses. One hundred six patients were enrolled, 92 of whom were evaluable for efficacy. There was a significantly greater rate of eradication of Staphylococcus aureus and total pathogens in mupirocin-treated patients than in control subjects. Analysis of the clinical data relative to all pathogens showed a significant difference in skin infection evaluations performed at the interim and follow-up visits, which favored the mupirocin-treated groups. In those patients infected with S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, there was a significant difference at end-point that favored mupirocin in seven clinical ratings and the skin infection evaluation at follow-up. Mild local adverse effects were noted in a small percentage of patients in each group. Mupirocin appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of secondarily infected dermatoses, especially in those infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - A bacteriologically controlled, randomized study comparing the efficacy of 2% mupirocin ointment (Bactroban) with oral erythromycin in the treatment of patients with impetigo.
AB  - Sixty patients participated in a bacteriologically controlled, randomized, parallel group comparison of 2% mupirocin ointment (Bactroban) and oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate for the treatment of impetigo. The trial included clinical and bacteriologic evidence and safety assessments. The Investigator's Global Evaluation, which compared the overall efficacy and safety of the trial drugs, demonstrated a more favorable performance for the mupirocin regimen. This difference was statistically and clinically significant. There were no significant differences between the trial regimens for any of the other efficacy variables examined. The bacteriologic success rate was 100% for both treatment groups. There was a clinically significant difference in adverse experience rates between treatment groups, with four (13%) of the erythromycin-treated patients reporting six adverse experiences versus none of the mupirocin-treated patients. The results of the trial indicate that 2% mupirocin ointment is as safe and effective as oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate in the treatment of patients with impetigo.
TI  - Mupirocin: a new topical antibiotic.
AB  - One hundred fifty-three strains of Staphylococcus aureus recovered from infected  eczema frequently demonstrated resistance to multiple antibiotics. Penicillin and ampicillin resistance was extremely frequent (88%), methicillin resistance was found in nearly 14% of strains, and erythromycin and tetracycline resistance was present in 16%. S. aureus strains were uniformly sensitive to vancomycin, mupirocin, and cephalosporins. Experimental infections in human volunteers showed topical therapy with 2% mupirocin was more effective than oral erythromycin in suppression of both S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - The clinical development of mupirocin.
AB  - Mupirocin is a novel antibiotic totally unrelated in chemical structure and mode  of action to any other clinically useful class of antibiotics. It has greatest antibacterial activity against aerobic gram-positive cocci, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bactroban ointment is formulated as 2% mupirocin in polyethylene glycol ointment. No systemic absorption of mupirocin or its major metabolite, monic acid, has been detected in short courses of topical administration to healthy volunteers or to patients with epidermolysis bullosa after prolonged courses of therapy with Bactroban ointment. Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials have shown that mupirocin is safe and effective for the treatment of impetigo.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in general practice.
AB  - With the addition of several new oral antibiotics to those already available, there is the implication that bacterial resistance has become a significant problem in general practice. To test this hypothesis it is worth examining the susceptibilities of the major bacterial pathogens isolated from community based infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - Differential binding of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to corneal epithelium in culture.
AB  - Adherence of bacteria to corneal epithelium is a prerequisite for corneal infection. We used two methods to study the binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus to rabbit corneal epithelial cells in culture. In the first method, rabbit corneal epithelial cells grown on glass slides were incubated with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus (10(7) CFU/ml) at room temperature for 90 min, and the bacterial binding to the epithelial cells was examined by light microscopy. Both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus bound to epithelial cells. P. aeruginosa was bound to the cell periphery whereas S. aureus was bound randomly to the cell surface. In the second method, suspension cultures of corneal epithelial cells were used. In contrast to the findings in cultures on slides, binding pattern with cells in suspension was similar for both species and resembled that for S. aureus in cultures on slides. A much greater number of P. aeruginosa (186 +/- 11 bacteria/epithelial cell) than S. aureus (30 +/- 1.5 bacteria/epithelial cell) bound to epithelial cells grown on glass slides. In contrast, a similar number of P. aeruginosa (25 +/- 5.1) and S. aureus (20 +/- 4.7) bound to epithelial cells grown in suspension cultures. Using either method, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind significantly (less than 5/cell) to corneal epithelial cells. The above methods should prove useful for characterization of bacterial binding to corneal epithelial cells in culture.
TI  - Treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - The use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. The bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin resistant 9), Staph. hominis (2), Staph. epidermidis (1), Staph. haemolyticus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Peptococcus spp. (1). Eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (Gram-positive plus Gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). In ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. Teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. The duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. Efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. Cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).
TI  - The phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
AB  - The toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenus gr. A, St. viridans, Pityrosporum ovale and Candida albicans were studied. P. ovale and St. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. P. ovale inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli. St. viridans inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli, St. pyogenus gr. A and P. ovale. This effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. The activity was increased by UVA on S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Ps. aeruginosa but not on E. coli and St. pyogenes gr. A. These effects of P. ovale and St. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
TI  - Adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro mediated by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - The adherence of two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis to human fibrin-platelet clots in vitro was investigated. Both strains were noncapsulated, nonhemagglutinating, and nonslime producers. Binding was not related to surface charge, carbohydrate profile, or hydrophobicity of the bacteria. Adherence was reduced four- to sixfold (P less than 0.001) on pretreatment of bacteria with lipase, while neuraminidase, trypsin, phospholipase C, and sodium periodate did not alter their binding. Pretreatment of bacteria with substances known to bind lipoteichoic acid (LTA), such as human albumin and anti-LTA antibodies, also resulted in a fourfold (P less than 0.001) reduction in adherence. Prior incubation of clots with free LTA, but not with deacylated LTA, produced a fourfold (P less than 0.001) decrease in the adherence of homologous and heterologous strains of S. epidermidis. A similar reduction was also observed when LTAs derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were used. These data provide evidence that the lipid moiety of LTA has a central role in the adherence of S. epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (II). Distribution and  antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.
TI  - Staphylococcal and streptococcal pyrogenic toxins involved in toxic shock syndrome and related illnesses.
AB  - Toxic-shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute onset, multiorgan illness which resembles  severe scarlet fever. The illness is caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains that express TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1), enterotoxin B, or enterotoxin C. TSST-1 is associated with menstrual TSS and approximately one-half of nonmenstrual cases; the other two toxins cause nonmenstrual cases, 47% and 3%, respectively. The three toxins are expressed in culture media under similar environmental conditions. These conditions may explain the association of certain tampons with menstrual TSS. Biochemically, the toxins are all relatively low molecular weight and fairly heat and protease stable. Enterotoxins B and C, share nearly 50% sequence homology with streptococcal scarlet fever toxin A; they share no homology with TSST-1 despite sharing numerous biological properties. Numerous animal models for development of TSS have suggested mechanisms of toxin action, though the exact molecular action is not known. The toxins are all potent pyrogens, induce T lymphocyte proliferation, requiring interleukin 1 release from macrophages, suppress immunoglobulin production, enhance endotoxin shock, and enhance hypersensitivity skin reactions. The genetic control of the toxins has been studied and suggests the exotoxins are variable traits. Some additional properties of TSS S. aureus which facilitate disease causation have been clarified.
TI  - In vitro activity of fleroxacin against aerobic gram-positive bacteria including  Corynebacterium jeikeium.
AB  - Fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240, AM-833), a new fluoro-4-quinolone, was tested in vitro against 273 gram-positive clinical isolates. Norfloxacin, a quinolone mostly used in urinary tract infections, was included as a standard. Overall, in vitro activities of fleroxacin and norfloxacin were superposable, but interestingly, fleroxacin was two- to fourfold more active against Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 mg/l of fleroxacin inhibited all 5 multiply resistant Corynebacterium jeikeium tested. While both quinolones were similarly active weight by weight, fleroxacin with its more favorable pharmacokinetic properties harbors the added promise of clinical usefulness in systemic infections against susceptible isolates.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, Ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  - The dual-action antibacterial R 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. It was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. Ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (Staphylococcus aureus 753, Serratia marcescens SM and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and Streptococcus pyogenes. In prophylactic studies, Ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against Escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against S. pyogenes, but Ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against E. coli and more active than fleroxacin against S. pyogenes. In a murine pneumonia model, Ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fleroxacin was inactive against S. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than Ro 23-9424 against K. pneumoniae. In a murine meningitis infection caused by S. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. When meningitis was induced by K. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. In a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, Ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. In the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, Ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime, alone or in combination, against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes was investigated. Synergy studies were performed using time-kill curves and the chequerboard test. The time-kill curves were performed on five strains each of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Strep. pyogenes; cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime were tested alone or in combination at MIC and sub-MIC values. The chequerboard test was performed in microtitre plates on ten strains each of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Strep. pyogenes: the results were interpreted by the fractional inhibitory concentration index. In some cases both methods showed synergistic interaction against the staphylococci tested. Indifference was observed against Strep. pyogenes.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - Induction of human TCR gamma delta + and TCR gamma delta-CD2+CD3- double negative lymphocytes by bacterial stimulation.
AB  - When human blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were incubated with heat-killed bacteria, proliferation of MNC was observed 5 days after stimulation, showing a peak on day 7. Interestingly, the bioassay of the culture supernatant and Northern blot analysis of mRNA demonstrated that no IL-2 production was associated with these proliferative responses. The induced lymphoblasts consisted predominantly of TCR gamma delta + (22.4 +/- 9.3%) and TCR gamma delta-CD2+CD3-(33.2 +/- 11.8%) double negative lymphocytes (n = 10), which were initially minor populations (less than 10%) in freshly isolated MNC. The prominent induction of TCR gamma delta + cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. TCR gamma delta + cells induced by bacterial stimulation seemed to generate from lymphocytes lacking the apparent expression of gamma delta TCR. The inducing capability for double negative cells is present in a large number of species of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria. Gel filtration analysis of ultrasonicated filtrates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes revealed that a substance with an Mr of 25-26 kd could be substituted for whole bacterial particles in the cell proliferative responses. In contrast to the purified protein derivative (PPD)-induced response, the response described here was inducible in the cord blood of neonates who had not yet been exposed to the corresponding bacterial infection. The physicochemical properties of the sonicated filtrates were different from those of PPD. These results suggested that the present phenomenon may be nonspecific, polyclonal (or oligoclonal) activation of TCR gamma delta + and TCR gamma delta -CD2+CD3- cells by bacterial stimulation.
TI  - Flow cytometric identification of microorganisms by dual staining with FITC and PI.
AB  - The identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry was evaluated by using a double staining technique with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate and a two dimensional analysis. A diverse group of 19 different species and strains of microorganisms was tested to determine if they could be differentiated by flow cytometry. The organisms tested displayed characteristic and distinct two dimensional fluorescent patterns which allowed ready grouping and differentiation into subsets of organisms. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the histograms and the ratio of red to green signals expressed these differences quantitatively and allowed organisms to be placed into one of three groups based on these values. In some instances, as with Streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, it was possible to distinguish between species of bacteria from the same genus. The use of dual dye labeling and flow cytometry provided a rapid method of identifying selected microorganisms and may be broadly applicable for the detection and identification of many bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - [The in vitro effects of josamycin on various strains of bacteria].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration of josamycin was studied by the dilution plate method on the strains Staphylococcus aureus, plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and enterococci. The effect of josamycin was compared with that of erythromycin, penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazol, and furantion. Of the series of 572 strains tested, josamycin was most effective in the strains Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. All the strains tested were susceptible to josamycin, including the Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to erythromycin. Of the plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci 2.6% resistant strains and 86.3% strains with decreased susceptibility were found. Of the enterococci 41.2% of the strains were resistant to josamycin. In these strains the most effective antibiotics were ampicillin and furantoin.
TI  - Comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. The 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. In the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: Haemophilus influenzae in 4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and Streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. The corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3, and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. Suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, Corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. When a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. The predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for S. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for H. influenzae and 68.7% for S. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for B. catarrhalis.
TI  - S-aryl (tetramethyl) isothiouronium salts as possible antimicrobial agents, IV.
AB  - The 1-octanol/water partition coefficients of a series of antimicrobial S-aryl(tetramethyl)isothiouronium salts, were determined. The concentration of the solute in the two phases was measured by means of HPLC. The values of the hydrophobic parameters thus obtained were correlated to the corresponding capacity factors (log Kw) and compared with those expected on the basis of additive-constitutive principles. The deviations were interpreted quantitatively on the basis of electronic interactions of the substituents in the benzene ring. Equations correlating structural features and antimicrobial activity of some studied compounds by means of molecular parameters were formulated.
TI  - 3-Sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems.
AB  - The stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. The known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds. Displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or DMF and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. The 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The following MIC's (microgram/mL) for the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: Staphylococcus aureus = 4, Streptococcus pyogenes = 1, Haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, Escherichia coli = 0.03, Enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, Proteus rettgeri = 0.25. The excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a new tetracyclic quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a tetracyclic quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro activity of KB-5246 against gram-negative bacteria was higher than that of ofloxacin or norfloxacin and was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria of the four agents tested. Among Streptococcus pyogenes strains resistant to 1.56 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 26 strains susceptible to 0.2 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Similarly, among the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains resistant to 3.13 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 23 S. aureus and 11 S. epidermidis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis strains resistant to 12.5 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 5 S. pneumoniae and 10 E. faecalis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. KB-5246 had bactericidal activity at the MIC. KB-5246 demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, KB-5246 was as active as ofloxacin and about two times more active than norfloxacin.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefixime. A review of its antibacterial activity. Pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefixime, previously designated FK027, FR17027 and CL284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. It is particularly active against many Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. Cefixime has little activity against Staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. Comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. The most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. Thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. It is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - [Cefotetan in the therapy of respiratory infections. Multicenter research].
AB  - In a controlled multicenter trial 291 patients have been treated with cefotetan.  They suffered from acute or chronic exacerbated bronchopulmonary disorders. In 110 patients it was possible to identify the etiological agent: enterobacteria (62), non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (10), Haemophilus influenzae (8), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (4). In the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (203), cefotetan was generally administered at the dose of 1 g/12 h i.m., whereas it was administered at the dose of 2 g/12 h i.v. in acute infection. The mean duration of therapy was 8.8 days. Positive clinical results were obtained in 251 patients (86.2%) with eradication of the pathogen initially isolated in 90.5% of cases. Cefotetan showed good local and general tolerance. The results obtained confirm those of studies concerning limited numbers of patients and show the efficacy of cefotetan both in acute and chronic pathologies, also in patients with serious involvement of their general conditions (concomitant pathologies, high mean age).
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Randomized comparative study of ampicillin/sulbactam vs. ceftriaxone for treatment of soft tissue and skeletal infections in children.
AB  - In a prospective study 105 children hospitalized with soft tissue infection, 11 children with suppurative arthritis and 9 children with osteomyelitis were treated with either parenterally administered ampicillin/sulbactam or ceftriaxone. Treatment was randomized using a computer-generated table in a 2:1 fashion: 84 patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 41 patients received ceftriaxone. Organisms isolated from wound site or blood cultures included Staphylococcus aureus (33), Streptococcus pyogenes (19), Haemophilus influenzae (9) including 4 beta-lactamase-positive organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3) and 9 other organisms. Clinical and bacteriologic response was satisfactory in 100% of the ampicillin/sulbactam-treated patients and in 93% of the ceftriaxone-treated patients. Two patients with S. aureus infections treated with ceftriaxone had a delayed response and required change in therapy to parenterally administered oxacillin. Ampicillin/sulbactam represents a potentially useful single agent for the treatment of cellulitis and bone or joint infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an  orally absorbed cephalosporin, with that of cephalexin and cefaclor. It inhabited Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.25 microgram/ml, sero groups B, C and G streptococci at 1 microgram/ml, and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 2 micrograms/ml. It was slightly more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. MDL 19,592 did not significantly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. strains (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). MDL 19,592 was not hydrolyzed by the plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1 of Klebsiella but was hydrolyzed by the TEM-3, Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase, and the chromosomal-mediated Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzymes.
TI  - [Osteomyelitis in newborn infants].
AB  - This article describes 12 patients (aged 1-28 days) suffering from neonatal osteomyelitis diagnosed between 1975 and 1987. Complications had occurred during 5 pregnancies, 9 patients had problems in the perinatal period (5 infections). In 9 cases (75%) only local symptoms existed, of which localized swelling, erythema, and loss of function were the most common. Deep soft-tissue swelling was the most common initial radiographic finding. Staphylococcus aureus (penicillin-resistant in all cases) was the most important aetiological organism (66%). Haemolytic streptococci occurred in 3 patients (group B twice, group A once). Six of 12 patients showed multifocal lesions, in 7 out of 12 patients concomitant septic arthritis existed. All patients received antibiotics (at least 2 weeks parenterally, total duration 6 weeks), while surgical intervention (exploration and drainage) took place in 8 patients. On follow-up (8 months-13 years) 4 patients showed deformity of the affected limb, leading to impaired function in 2 cases. Patients suffering from neonatal osteomyelitis require fast and properly directed therapy in order to prevent serious sequelae. Early surgical intervention is necessary if joint involvement exists.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefteram pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifty-three patients with bacterial infections were treated with 8.3 to 21.8 mg/kg/day of CFTM-PI. The drug was very effective (efficacy rate 98.1%) in pharyngitis, otitis media, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia and skin infections. The antibacterial potency was very good against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was comparable with cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CFTM-PI therapy. The data suggest that CFTM-PI is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies were done on the effect of  cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588) (10% granules), a new oral cephalosporin, in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were studied comparatively with activities of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX) and ampicillin (ABPC). MICs of CFTM against S. aureus were distributed in a range between 0.78 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, with a peak value of 3.13 micrograms/ml, which were similar to MIC ranges of CEX and CCL. MICs of CFTM against all strains of S. pyogenes were less than or equal to 0.025 microgram/ml, which were similar to MIC of ABPC. CFTM was approximately 2 to 3 folds more effective than CCL or CEX. 2. Absorption and excretion. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of CFTM were determined in doses of 3 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (non-fasting and fasting). In non-fasting subjects, peak concentrations of CFTM in serum were dose-dependent and were 1.15-2.3 micrograms/ml and 1.8-3.6 micrograms/ml at 2-3 hours, 0.125-0.78 micrograms/ml and 0.245-0.97 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, respectively, for the 2 dose levels. Serum half-lives were 1.03-2.65 hours for the dose of 3 mg/kg and 1.07-1.83 hours for 6 mg/kg. In fasting subjects, the mean peak serum concentrations were 1.73 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 1.13 micrograms/ml at 6 hours for the dose of 6 mg/kg. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours varied 5.3-19.2%. 3. Clinical study Clinical efficacies were examined in a total of 41 cases including 9 cases of bacterial pneumonia, 10 cases of bronchitis, 11 cases of tonsillitis, 7 cases of urinary tract infections, 3 cases of scarlet fever and 1 case of otitis media. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 30 cases, good in 10 cases, poor in 1 case, hence the efficacy rate was 97.6%. All of the 28 bacteria identified in these cases were eradicated after CFTM-PI treatments. No noticeable abnormalities were found as side effects. An elevation of eosinophil, an increase of platelet count and elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in 3 patients.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - [Antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin G10X].
AB  - Data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin G10X, a preparation of lytic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis SK-52 are presented. Lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. When it was used as a substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in B. brevis, B. cereus, B. pumilis, B. subtilis and S. faecalis. Preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. Sometimes the increase was very high (B. sphaericus, B. subtilis 720, E. coli K12 and MRE-600). Such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (B. cereus 1312, C. renale, M. luteus, S. aureus KP, 800, 805 and 126001, S. pyogenes 291). An increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. However, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with its 10 times higher doses. An increase in the lysis level was also achieved with increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. Proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. Its use in veterinary was a success.
TI  - Comparative double-blinded study between mupirocin and tetracycline ointments for treating skin infections.
AB  - A double-blinded study was conducted to compare the effects of mupirocin and tetracycline ointments in the treatment of skin infections. 111 patients were available for clinical assessment, of which 53 were treated with mupirocin and 58 treated with tetracycline. Clinically, both groups were improved, and there was no significant difference. Bacteriological assessment however revealed a better response to mupirocin. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were the most common organisms isolated. 99% of Staphylococci were sensitive to mupirocin compared with 61% to tetracycline and 29% to penicillin G. 57% of Group A beta haemolytic Streptococci were resistant to tetracycline compared to 14% to mupirocin. Gram-negative organisms were mostly resistant to both preparations. No side effects were observed in both treatment groups. This study suggests that mupirocin is a safe and effective topical preparation for treating most of our common skin infections.
TI  - Topical mupirocin treatment of impetigo is equal to oral erythromycin therapy.
AB  - Topical antimicrobial therapy has not been effective in the past against cutaneous bacterial infections. In this study, a new topical antibiotic ointment, mupirocin, was compared with oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate in the treatment of impetigo. Seventy-five patients clinically diagnosed as having impetigo and with positive cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both were examined in an investigator-blinded study. Patients used topical mupirocin applied three times daily or the usual oral dose of erythromycin ethylsuccinate (30 to 50 mg/kg per day). Patients' lesions were examined clinically and cultured bacteriologically on days 0, 3, and 8, and 1 week after treatment. Susceptibility testing was performed on pathogens isolated to determine antibiotic resistance. Mupirocin treatment produced similar clinical results to oral erythromycin and was superior in the eradication of S aureus, including antibiotic-resistant S aureus. These results show topical mupirocin to be a safe and effective alternative to oral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of impetigo.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical study of cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup for skin and soft tissue infections in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Concurrently with administering a newly developed cephem derivative antibiotic (CEP), cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup, to children with skin and soft tissue infections, activities of 7 drugs against a group of microorganisms were tested. The drugs tested included 4 drugs of the cephem group, R-3746, a Na-salt form of CPDX, cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX) and cefadroxil (CDX), and 3 drugs of the penicillin group, ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC). The bacterial strains tested were 71 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, all isolated from the above cases of pediatric infections. Inoculum sizes used in these tests were 10(6) and 10(8) cfu/ml. Ages of children in those cases to which the drug was administered ranged from 2 months to 15 years. A total of 66 cases were treated, including 60 cases of impetigo, 5 cases of subcutaneous abscess and 1 case of phlegmon. The drug was administered for an average of 6 days with a daily average dose level of 9.4 mg/kg divided into 3 doses except 1 case where a twice daily dose regimen was used. Clinical and bacteriological effects were examined, and the occurrence of adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results were recorded. The results of these tests are summarized below. 1. The activity test for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX) against 71 strains of S. aureus performed at an inoculum level of 10(8) cfu/ml showed 2 peaks of MIC values, one in a range of 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml and the other higher than 100 micrograms/ml. The most prevalent MIC value was 3.13 micrograms/ml with MIC against 51 strains or 71.8% of the strains tested showing this value, and MIC values of 25 micrograms/ml or higher were obtained for 13 strains or 18.3% of the strains tested. The MIC80 was 6.25 micrograms/ml. Thus, R-3746 showed an antibacterial activity slightly weaker than MCIPC and DMPPC but similar to CCL, CEX and CDX. MIC values obtained at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml also had 2 peaks, one in a range of 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml and the other higher than 25 micrograms/ml. Strains against which R-3746 had the MIC value of 3.13 micrograms/ml were the most numerous with 47 strains or 66.2%, and strains against which the MIC value of higher than 25 micrograms/ml was obtained were next with 13 strains or 18.3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of freezing on bacteriologic culturing of mastitis milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the effect of freezing and length of freezing in a commercial freezer on the qualitative results of bacteriologic culturing of milk collected from glands of cows with clinical or subclinical intramammary infections. A total of 182 milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 55 milk samples of cows with subclinical mastitis were taken from four problem herds. Samples were split into four equal sub-samples. Three of these were frozen immediately at -20 degrees C and 1 was submitted fresh for bacteriologic analysis. At 4, 8, and 16 wk after collection, samples were thawed and submitted for bacteriologic culturing. Freezing and increased length of storage resulted in 1) a decrease in the number of samples that had cultures of Escherichia coli or Actinomyces pyogenes; and 2) an increase in the number of samples that had cultures of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Freezing had no effect on streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Effects of microbial challenge on sleep in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits challenged with viable Staphylococcus aureus exhibit marked time-dependent changes in sleep patterns. To examine the generality of this observation, we monitored sleep patterns for 24 h before and for 48 h after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, or Candida albicans. All three agents produced complex time-dependent changes in sleep. Inoculation with S. pyogenes or C. albicans increased the time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) during h 4-20 after challenge. Electroencephalographic delta wave amplitudes (DWA) increased during h 4-8 after injection, but decreased during h 24-38 after inoculation. Altered sleep patterns were not observed when similar doses of heat-killed organisms were administered. In contrast, inoculation with E. coli produced a large increase in both SWS time and DWA for the first 2-4 h after inoculation. DWA then decreased from 6 to 32 h after inoculation. Similar effects occurred when heat-killed E. coli were administered. Rapid eye movement sleep was reduced by all three agents. These data demonstrate that altered sleep patterns occur in response to infectious challenge in rabbits, and that these changes are related to the type of infectious organism involved.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of S-ofloxacin.
AB  - S-Ofloxacin, the optically active form of ofloxacin, was twice as active as the S,R mixture of ofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive species. Of the Enterobacteriaceae, 90% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and 90% of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. Organisms resistant to ofloxacin were resistant to S-ofloxacin. Like ofloxacin activity, the activity of S-ofloxacin was reduced by Mg2+ and by acid pH. Spontaneous mutational resistance to S-ofloxacin was similar to that to ofloxacin.
TI  - Binding of novel macrolide structures to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B-resistant ribosomes inhibits protein synthesis and bacterial growth.
AB  - Dimethylation of adenine 2058 in 23S rRNA renders bacteria resistant to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance), because the antibiotic binding site on the altered 50S ribosomal subunit is no longer accessible. We now report that certain 6-O-methyl-11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives of erythromycin are able to bind to dimethylated MLS-resistant 50S ribosomal subunits, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and cell growth. One of these novel structures, an 11-deoxy-11-(carboxyamino)-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11,12-(cyclic ester) derivative, structure 1a, was studied in detail. It inhibited in vitro protein synthesis in extracts prepared from both susceptible and MLS-resistant Bacillus subtilis with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.4 and 20 microM, respectively. The derivative bound specifically to a single site on the 50S subunit of MLS-resistant ribosomes prepared from B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and no binding to 30S subunits was observed. The association rate constant of derivative 1a with sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 100- and 500-fold slower, respectively, than that of the parent compound, erythromycin, with sensitive ribosomes. The dissociation rate constant of 1a from sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 50- to 100-fold slower than the rate of erythromycin dissociation from sensitive ribosomes. Furthermore, 1a binding to sensitive 50S subunits led to induction of ermC and ermD, while binding to resistant 50S subunits did not, showing that perturbation of sensitive and resistant 50S subunit function by 1a differs. These data demonstrated that 1a is unique in its interaction with MLS-resistant ribosomes and that this interaction causes a novel allosteric perturbation of ribosome function.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from Prosopis juliflora.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from Prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two Candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. Significant inhibitory effect was noted against Gram positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. citreus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against S. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. lactis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. hofmannii and Bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. Its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. The inhibitory effect of julifloricine on Gram negative bacteria such as the species of Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Aeromonas and Vibrio was almost insignificant. Julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against C. tropicalis and responded equally to C. albicans. As compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which included Herpes simplex 1 and Newcastle disease virus. Julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.
TI  - Microbiology of obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tonsillar surface and core of children with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis and children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy was performed. No qualitative difference was found within the two population groups. Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were the most prevalent beta-lactamase-producing isolates in both groups. Staphylococcus aureus had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production on the tonsillar surface of children with recurrent tonsillitis, while Streptococcus pyogenes was more prevalent in the tonsillar surface cultures of children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy. The bacterial density was high but not significantly different in both groups of children. The similar microbial composition and density of both groups and the higher rate of S pyogenes recovery may signify a subclinical disease or normal flora in children with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy.
TI  - Skin graft survival--the bacterial answer.
AB  - An in vitro wound model was created to determine the mechanism by which bacteria  cause skin graft failure. A wound surface was simulated by a human fibrin clot. Staphylococcus aureus or group A streptococcus was incubated over the clot. Either saline, human plasminogen, aprotinin, or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), or a combination of these, was added to the tubes. After 30 hours, the tubes were examined for the presence of the clot. The supernatant was then examined for the presence of fibrin degradation products (FDP). S. aureus was incapable of destroying the fibrin clot without the presence of plasminogen in the culture media. Group A streptococcus was capable of some clot degradation, but this was markedly improved in the presence of plasminogen. High FDP levels correlated with the destruction of the clot. Both aprotinin and EACA were capable of preserving the fibrin clots. In this study we carefully controlled the chemical and bacterial milieu on a simulated wound.
TI  - Effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  - The mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. Of the bacteria used, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli 07 K1 were encapsulated. As demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, IGIV showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for S. aureus and S. enteritidis and of 1:8 for S. pyogenes and E. coli 07 K1. IGIV alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. Addition of IGIV did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. In contrast, addition of IGIV promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. The IGIV preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. IGIV also markedly augmented C3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. These studies suggest that IGIV containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids from normal and essential fatty  acid-deficient mice.
AB  - Among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet are  hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and altered lipid profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. Because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and EFAD hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. EFAD mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which Staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. Despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that EFAD lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. Skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. After thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. EFAD extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. S. aureus strain 502A survived equally well on EFAD as on normal mice. Normal lipids applied on EFAD mice had no additional effect, but EFAD lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. If the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502A was reduced by 71%. If instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase TEWL, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. The application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. EFAD and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Rapid detection of Bordetella pertussis by a monoclonal antibody-based colony blot assay.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used in a colony blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for rapid detection of B. pertussis. Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. This assay may be useful for identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in suspected cases of whooping cough.
TI  - [Reactivity of human lymphocytes to yeast-like and mold fungi].
AB  - The capacity of the allergens of mold fungi (Rhizopus nigricans, Mucor pusillus,  Alternaria tenuis, Cladosporum herbarum, Fusarium oxysporum) and yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans) to induce the production of lymphokins by human lymphocytes was studied. All these preparations were active in reactions with lymphocytes obtained from adult donors, but did not activate lymphocytes of newborns (obtained from umbilical blood). In equal doses (10 micrograms/ml) C. albicans allergen was more active than the preparations of mold fungi. The capacity of bacterial allergens to stimulate human lymphocytes was found to be either more pronounced (in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) than that of the preparation of C. albicans or equal to it (in Streptococcus faecalis). The results thus obtained may be regarded as the manifestation of immunological contacts with the antigens of different microorganisms, as well as the evidence of the immunological nature of lymphocytic reactions to preparations intended for use in clinical allergology.
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - Pacidamycins, a novel series of antibiotics with anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa activity. III. Microbiologic profile.
AB  - Pacidamycins are nucleosidyl-peptide antibiotics which have activity only against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their MICs for other organisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, most Streptococci and other Pseudomonas species are greater than 100 micrograms/ml. These compounds had no activity against erythromycin-susceptible Streptococci. The MICs for Streptococcus pyogenes with constitutive- and inducible-type of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance were 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MICs against P. aeruginosa ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. The activity of these compounds was 1 to 2-fold less in serum than broth. Time-kill curves were performed using 4 and 8 times the MIC of pacidamycin 1. It was bactericidal against P. aeruginosa (3 log10 decrease in 4 to 6 hours). At 24 hours, resistant mutants were found in the cultures. The MICs of piperacillin and gentamicin for these mutants were the same as for the parent strain. The frequency of resistance to these compounds was less than 3.5 x 10(-6). The resistant mutants were stable after 10 transfers in antibiotic-free medium. The pacidamycins were inactive against P. aeruginosa in mouse protection test. After a single subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of pacidamycin 1, the Cmax was approximately 50 micrograms/ml and the serum half-life was 0.5 hour.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in samples of milk from cows studied for the causative  agent of mastitis].
AB  - Milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the State Veterinary Institute at Pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. In the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. Streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed Streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and Streptococcus uberis (1.9%). The presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens C, G and L was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. Coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and Actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. The remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of 3.6% of the cows. Coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. Over the five years of study, the occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  - [Acute infectious cellulitis. Apropos of 28 cases].
AB  - Acute infectious cellulitis is a common condition in pediatric patients. We retrospectively studied 28 cases seen over the last four years. Average age of patients was four years. Fever and a decline in general health were often found. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms in our series. Outcome was favorable under early antimicrobial therapy selected according to age and clinical features. Before three months of age, cellulitis suggests a streptococcus B infection and should be treated by ampicillin or parenteral penicillin, combined with an aminoglycoside if called for. Between 4 months and 2 years of age, Haemophilus influenzae b or a pneumococcus are the most likely organisms; Haemophilus cellulitis should be treated by a third generation cephalosporin for ten days or longer, followed by ampicillin or ampicillin-clavulanic acid per os for ten or 15 days. Beyond 2-3 years of age, all organisms may be the cause of cellulitis, but the most likely are Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, treatment consists in administration of either a penicillin M or a macrolide, the route being selected according to the general condition and site of the cellulitis.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively.

The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Clarithromycin].
AB  - Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic agent, was evaluated bacteriologically and clinically for its efficacy and safety in pediatrics by a study group organized with pediatricians from all over the country. A summary of the results of the evaluation is as follows. 1. Absorption and excretion Pharmacokinetics of TE-031 was examined by single oral administration of 10% granules and 50 mg tablets at doses of 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. There were no significant differences between 10% granules and 50 mg tablets, and between administrations before and after meal. Peaks and half-life periods of blood level of TE-031 given once at doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg (10% granules) before meal were 1.58, 4.37 and 3.79 micrograms/ml, and 2.53, 3.17 and 2.20 hours, respectively, and the urinary excretion in 6 hours after the administration were about 20-30%. 2. Antibacterial effects TE-031 was proved to have excellent antibacterial effect, i.e., inhibiting growth over 80% of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.10 micrograms/ml, Branhamella catarrhalis at 0.39 micrograms/ml, and Campylobacter jejuni at 0.78 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococcus aureus, TE-031 showed very similar activity spectrum to EM, and EM resistant strains were also resistant to TE-031. 3. Clinical results A total of 764 cases was studied. Clinical effects of TE-031 were evaluated in 717 cases out of the 764, excluding drop-outs and cases which did not meet specified protocols. Clinically, efficacies of TE-031 were "excellent" in 265 cases and "good" in 161 cases out of 453 cases of Group A in which causal agents were identified, with an efficacy rate of 94.0%, and out of 264 cases of Group B in which pathogens were not detected, clinical effects of TE-031 were "excellent" in 115 cases and "good" in 124 cases, with an efficacy rate of 90.5%. In terms of clinical effects of TE-031 classified by diseases when Group A and B were combined, efficacy rates were 91.6% for upper respiratory tract infection (217/237), 90.0% for bacterial pneumonia (108/120), 97.4% for Mycoplasma pneumonia (111/114), 100% for Chlamydia pneumonia (4/4), 85.0% for pertussis (34/40), 100% for scarlet fever (16/16), 83.9% for skin and soft tissue infection (26/31), and 98.9% for Campylobacter enteritis (87/88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical study on clarithromycin granule and tablet in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed macrolide clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), with antibacterial  spectrum and antibacterial activity nearly equal to those of erythromycin (EM), shows beneficial characteristics such as a higher blood level, higher recovery rate in urine, and better penetration into each tissue than conventional macrolides (MLs). TE-031 has been studied in adults against various infections and proved to be useful. The present paper describes the results of a study in children to examine the usefulness of TE-031 granules and tablets with a potency of 50 mg. TE-031 granules were administered to 132 children with ages from 6 months to 13 years and 10 months. Excluded from the evaluation were 12 cases in which clinical effects were deemed unevaluable. The evaluable subjects consisted of 1 case with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 9 with acute bronchitis, 19 with pneumonia, 19 with mycoplasmal pneumonia, 2 with scarlet fever, 20 with Campylobacter enteritis, 11 with impetigo, 2 with subcutaneous abscess, 18 with primary atypical pneumonia and 16 with acute enteritis of unidentified pathogens; a total of 120 subjects. An average daily dose of TE-031 was 25.9 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses except 1 case with 2 daily doses and lengths of the treatment averaged 7 days. TE-031 tablets each containing 50 mg potency, were administered to 49 subjects with ages from 3 year and a month to 14 years consisting of 8 cases with pharyngitis, 1 with tonsillitis, 1 with acute bronchitis, 4 with pneumonia, 14 with mycoplasmal pneumonia, 4 with scarlet fever, 5 with Campylobacter enteritis, 7 with impetigo, 1 with atypical pneumonia, 1 with Salmonella gastroenteritis and 3 with acute enteritis caused by unidentified pathogens, at an average daily dose of 13.5 mg/kg dived into 2-4 doses (2 doses/day for 12 cases, 3 doses for 32, 4 doses for 5) for 7 days on the average. In addition to examine the clinical and bacteriological effects of the 2 dosage forms of TE-031, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 9 antibiotics consisting of 5 MLs including TE-031, EM, josamycin (JM), midecamycin acetate (MDM acetate), and rokitamycin (RKM), 3 penicillins including ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin, cloxacillin and 1 cephem antibiotic, cefaclor (CCL), against 29 strains consisting of 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 7 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 of Streptococcus pneumonia 2 of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 of Campylobacter jejuni, out of 71 strains of pathogens or possible pathogens that had been isolated from the cases given TE-031.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on use of clarithromycin granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Studies were conducted on in vivo pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) in children and also on the efficacy and the safety of this macrolide antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. TE-031 granules were orally administered to 5 children in a dosage of 5 mg/kg before meal. Maximum drug concentrations (range: 0.29-2.0 micrograms/ml) in the serum occurred during a period from 30 minutes to 1 hour after administration, but there were clear differences in blood concentrations among the individuals. 2. TE-031 granules were orally administered in a average dosage of 20 mg/kg/day to a total of 17 patients, consisting of 14 children with respiratory tract infections and 3 children with intestinal infections. The clinical efficacy evaluation resulted in 10 excellent cases, 6 good cases and 1 fair case, for an efficacy rate of 94.1%. 3. Studies on the bacterial efficacy were carried out for 10 cases. The TE-031 bacteriological efficacy evaluation showed elimination in 7 cases, a decreased bacterial count in 2 cases, and no change in 1 case. The elimination rate was, thus, 70.0%. Elimination rates according to different species of bacteria were 66.7% (2 of 3 strains) for Staphylococcus aureus, 100% for both Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 of 3) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1 of 1), and 42.9% (3 of 7) for Haemophilus influenzae. 4. There were no symptoms which were attributable to side effects of the TE-031 therapy. The only laboratory test abnormality detected was eosinophilia in 1 patient.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 96% clinically and 72% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 5. None of children refused TE-031.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin in pediatrics].
AB  - Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) is a new 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic developed by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. TE-031 has a methoxy group at position 6 in its structure. In the present study, we carried out laboratory and clinical investigations on TE-031 in the field of pediatrics. The obtained results are summarized as follows. The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was investigated against 16 clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Campylobacter jejuni. TE-031 showed antibacterial activity comparable to erythromycin. The pattern of changes in TE-031 concentrations in the blood after administration was investigated. In subjects administered the granular preparation of TE-031, Cmax values were 0.64 micrograms/ml in 1 subject given a 5 mg/kg dosage, and 5.94 and 9.02 micrograms/ml in 2 subjects administered with 10 mg/kg. The tablet form of TE-031 was administered to 3 subjects at 5 mg/kg, and Cmax values were 2.09-3.92 micrograms/ml, while T 1/2 values were in a range of 2.9-3.8 hours. When drug concentrations in the urine were investigated, it was found that 6-hour recovery rates were 9.9% (dose: 5 mg/kg) and 53.4% (dose: 10 mg/kg) in the subjects administered the granular form, whereas recovery rates averaged 36.8% in the tablet-administered subjects. In the clinical trial, TE-031 was administered in 2-3 doses/day for 2-18 days. In cases given the granular form, dosages were 12-38 mg/kg/day, while tablets were administered at 12-29 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 92.8%, i.e., the drug was effective in 64 of 69 patients. TE-031 was ineffective in 1 case of otitis media, but efficacious in 10 of 10 (100%) cases of upper respiratory infection, 15 of 18 (83.3%) cases of bronchitis and pneumonia, 5 of 6 (83.3%) cases of pertussis, 13 of 13 (100%) cases of mycoplasmal pneumonia, 4 of 4 (100%) cases of Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia, 16 of 16 (100%) cases of gastroenteritis (including 15 cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis), and 1 (100%) case of impetigo. In bacteriological studies conducted on the patients, the overall elimination rate was 93.1%, i.e., bacterial elimination was obtained in 27 of 29 cases. TE-031 showed especially good bacteriological efficacy (100%) against C. jejuni and B. pertussis, which were eliminated from all of 15 and 2 cases examined, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Sensitivity patterns of bacteria isolated from patients at Sidamo Regional Hospital.
AB  - This study from the Sidamo Regional Hospital presents the prevailing sensitivity  to common antimicrobials among 337 bacterial isolates from abscesses, infected wounds, urine or gonorrhoeal infections. As expected, Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia cloi, Proteus supp and Streptococcus pyogenes were most frequently grown from abscesses and infected wounds, whereas E. coli, Proteus spp, Klebsiella spp, and coagulase negative staphylococci dominated in urinary tract infections. Very high rates of reduced sensitivity, including multiresistance to commonly used antibiotics, were detected. Of 54 isolates of Niesseria gonorrhoeae 84% were resistant to penicillin-G by disc diffusion method. Beta lactamase production was detected in 4 of 6 isolates tested.
TI  - Bacterial adherence of group A streptococci to mucosal surfaces.
AB  - It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. After the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced fit) fashion with complementary receptors on mucosal surfaces of the host. The adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. In group-A streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored to a protein(s) on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. In an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin recognized by LTA and group-A streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture absorbed with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococci adsorbed several high molecular weight fragments as well as a 28- and a 23-kdalton fragment, whereas S. pyogenes cells absorbed only the 28-kdalton fragment completely. The adsorbtion of the fragments by S. pyogenes was blocked by LTA. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide copying the NH2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a Western blot with the 28-kdalton fragment, indicating that S. pyogenes and its LTA react with the NH2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site distinct from that of S. aureus. Our findings are consistent with the idea that LTA mediates the attachment of group-A streptococci to fatty acid-binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells.
TI  - Sporotrichoid pyogenic bacterial infection.
AB  - Two cases of pyogenic bacterial infection, which initially resembled lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis are reported. In case 1, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group A were cultured from the lesion and in case 2, S. aureus alone. Histologically, botryomyotic grains were identified in case 2; this patient had diffuse normolipidemic plane xanthoma. With oral administration of cefaclor, the cutaneous lesions dramatically improved in both cases.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome-associated staphylococcal and streptococcal pyrogenic toxins are potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor production.
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome-associated staphylococcal and streptococcal exotoxins were tested for an ability to induce the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C1, along with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, all induced TNF production in a dose-dependent manner, with production peaking on the average at 3 days but continuing over the 6 days tested. This time course of exotoxin-induced TNF production contrasts with the 1-day peak-2-day duration observed with endotoxin as the stimulus and may be significant to development of toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - Transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4165 and BM4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (LY146032). Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics of beta-lactam antibiotics. Studies on the paradoxical and postantibiotic effects in vitro and in an animal model.
AB  - The pharmacodynamics of antibiotics, i.e. the rate of killing and the time before regrowth of surviving bacteria, may be important factors for determination of the dosage interval. In the present study the effect of protein binding, antibiotic concentrations, bacterial growth phase and bacterial inoculum on the rate of bacterial killing was investigated. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) was also studied in vitro and in vivo. The killing rate of S. aureus did not differ when the bacteria were exposed to the same free concentrations of dicloxacillin in medium with and without albumin. Protein binding per se did thus not diminish the bactericidal activity. A paradoxically reduced bactericidal effect was noted when S. aureus was exposed to high concentrations of dicloxacillin, cloxacillin and benzylpenicillin. For determination of PAE of imipenem on Ps. aeruginosa, counts of viable bacteria were compared with assay of bacterial intracellular ATP. Both methods demonstrated a PAE for the strains tested at an inoculum of 10(6) cfu/ml. At an inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml no PAE was found, which coincided with a lack of bactericidal effect. Both the PAE and the bactericidal effect were restored with aeration of the cultures, indicating insufficient penetration of imipenem to the target sites at low oxygen tension. An in vivo model in rabbits with implanted tissue cages was developed for evaluation of the PAE. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci showed a PAE of approximately 2 h in vivo, which correlated well with the PAE found in vitro. Despite that streptococci in postantibiotic phase (PA-phase) were non-multiplying, such bacteria were killed as efficiently as previously untreated controls when exposed to 10xMIC of penicillin both in vitro and in vivo. However, streptococci in PA-phase were much more sensitive to the repeated challenge to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin than previously untreated controls. In vivo, no difference in sensitivity to sub-MIC penicillin concentrations between streptococci in PA-phase and untreated controls was seen, probably due to the presence of host factors in the tissue cage fluid. It seems that for streptococci, subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations are more important for the sucess with intermittent dosing than the PAE, especially when a normal host defence is present.

TI  - [Clinical studies on sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetics, safety and effects on bacterial infection of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were evaluated in 17 children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetics in 3 children receiving a single dose of 10 mg per kg body weight were evaluated. The half-life of ampicillin (ABPC) was 1.38 +/- 0.14 hours and that of sulbactam was 0.93 +/- 0.26 hour. 2. Fourteen cases, including 7 tonsillitis, 2 pharyngitis, 2 bronchitis, and 1 each of cystitis, scarlet fever and cellulitis were treated with SBTPC fine granule. The clinical efficacy rate was 100%. 3. Bacteriological efficacies classified by causative organisms were evaluated in 5 children. Staphylococcus aureus was responsible in 3 cases, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 case, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in 1 case. Eradication rate was 100%. SBTPC was more active than ABPC against ABPC-resistant strains and almost equal to or more active than cephalexin or cefaclor. 4. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was eosinophilia in 2 children. No side effects were recorded. From the above results it is concluded that SBTPC fine granule is one of first choices of effective, useful and safe antibiotics for the treatment of infections in pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical experience with sultamicillin fine granules in pediatric field].
AB  - Sultamicillin fine granules were used orally in 18 pediatric patients with infections in doses ranging 7.3-10.0 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. The following is a summary of the results: 1. Clinical efficacies in 16 cases with tonsillitis were excellent in 13 cases, good in 2 cases and fair in 1 case. Efficacy in 1 case of bronchitis and 1 case of pneumonia were good. The overall efficacy rate in the 18 cases was 94.4%. 2. Four out of 5 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were eradicated but 1 strain persisted. Three out of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were rated as eradicated, 1 strain as decreased and 3 strains as persisted. Two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 3 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were eradicated. The bacteriological efficacy rate for the 17 strains was 70.6%. Four strains out of the 17 were found to produce beta-lactamase and 3 strains were suspected, to produce the enzyme, but of these 7 strains, 5 strains were eradicated. 3. Diarrhea and loose stool were observed as side effects in each of 2 cases. It appeared that diarrhea was related to this drug. A slight elevation of GOT was observed in 1 case in laboratory tests. 4. This drug appears to be easy for children to take in terms of taste and smell.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - Topical mupirocin vs. systemic erythromycin treatment for pyoderma.
AB  - Although topical antibiotics have been considered less than effective agents in the treatment of "impetigo," recent experience suggests that topical therapy has a place as primary treatment of pyoderma and impetigo. This bacteriologically controlled, randomized study compared the safety and efficacy of mupirocin with oral erythromycin in the treatment of pyoderma and impetigo. A total of 29 mupirocin-treated and 30 erythromycin-treated patients completed the study. None of the mupirocin-treated patients reported adverse experiences compared with 4 erythromycin-treated patients who reported 6 adverse experiences. The mupirocin-treated group had a significantly higher benefit:risk ratio than the erythromycin-treated group as measured by the investigator's global evaluation (P = 0.01). Both treatments eradicated 100% of the two most common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Results from this study demonstrate that mupirocin is as effective as systemic erythromycin ethylsuccinate for treatment of pyoderma and impetigo.
TI  - Pyomyositis--an under-reported disease in temperate climates.
AB  - Two cases of pyomyositis were seen over a period of 2 weeks. Both patients were young local residents in whom large amounts of pus were found deep within skeletal muscles. The first case had an unusual presentation involving more than one muscle. The causative organism in the first case was Staphylococcus aureus. In the second case it was Streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  - The role of Haemophilus influenzae in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children.
AB  - The role of specific bacteria in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children in unknown. To determine the effect of specific bacteria on the presence and nature of tonsillar hypertrophy (measured both clinically and by tonsil weight), quantitative aerobic bacteriology was performed on 54 tonsil-core specimens from 54 children undergoing tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. Twelve tonsil-core biopsies from 12 children with no history of tonsil disease served as controls. Haemophilus influenzae (HI), Streptococcus pyogenes (SP), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn), and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) were the most common microorganisms cultured from diseased tonsils. Few bacteria were cultured from the cores of controls. HI was cultured as the dominant aerobic bacteria in 15 of 54 tonsils (27%). For HI alone, the number of bacteria/gram tonsil showed a significant positive correlation to tonsil weight (p less than 0.05). Fourteen of 15 (94%) tonsils with HI were found in patients with clinical tonsillar hypertrophy, while only 6 of 10 patients (60%) with SP and SPn had tonsillar hypertrophy. Of the 38 tonsils removed for obstructive symptoms (clinical hypertrophy), 14 of 38 (37%) cultured HI as the dominant microorganisms, whereas only 6 of 38 (16%) cultured SP. Neither the type of HI (b vs. non-b) nor the presence of beta-lactamase production had a significant correlation to tonsil weight, bacterial load or the number of B- or T-cell subsets. The number of T-helper (Th), T-suppressor (Ts) and B-cells (per gram/tonsil) was markedly greater in all diseased tonsils than in controls. For both HI and SP the total number of bacteria/gram tonsil correlated positively to the number of Ts cells (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.007, respectively). In patients with HI type b (HI-b), the tonsil weight correlated to an increase in Ts and B-cells (p less than 0.004 and p less than 0.007, respectively). An increased presence of the Ts and B-cells in the HI-b tonsils (and not in tonsils with HI non-b) suggests a differential response by the tonsil to these distinct but related bacteria. The above data strongly support an etiological role for HI in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children. Alterations in the relationship between Th and Ts cells may affect normal B-cell function and be implicated in this phenomenon. Clinical implications for pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and future directions for research are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup on skin and soft tissue infections in  the pediatric fields].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic, was administered to children with ages between 6 months and 15 years and 10 months suffering from skin and soft tissue infections including 41 cases of impetigo, one case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and 2 cases of subcutaneous abscess totalling 44 cases. The average daily dose level used was 31.3 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses, for an average of 6 days of treatment. MICs of 4 different macrolide antibiotics including RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM) and midecamycin acetate (MDM acetate) were determined against 32 bacterial strains isolated from these cases including 30 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. The inoculum level used was 10(6) cells/ml. Among these strains of bacteria, 20 strains of S. aureus and 1 strain of S. pyogenes were also used, at the same inoculum size, for the determination of MICs of 4 beta-lactam antibiotics including 3 different penicillins such as ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) and cefaclor (CCL), a cephem antibiotic. RKM was then evaluated through the above treatment for its clinical efficacy, bacteriological effects, side effects and effects on laboratory test values. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Activities of drugs tested were compared to each other. MIC90 of RKM against S. aureus averaged 0.39 microgram/ml, and against no strains of S. aureus showed MIC values of higher than 25 micrograms/ml, thus, the antibacterial activity of RKM against S. aureus was the highest among the 8 drugs tested. The activity of MCIPC was next highest followed by that of DMPPC, MIC determination was done on only 2 strains, or, for some drugs, only one strain, of S. pyogenes, and RKM showed activities somewhat lower than ABPC and EM, and similar to JM and CCL within the limited testing. 2. Clinical efficacies of RKM determined by doctors in charge were 97.6% in the 41 cases of impetigo, with good or excellent efficacies were observed, 100% in the single case of SSSS and the 2 cases of subcutaneous abscess. Thus an overall efficacy on the 44 cases was rated very high, at 97.7%. 3. Clinical efficacy rating according to accumulated scores was determinable in 37 cases including all the 3 diseases on the third day of treatment with an efficacy rate of 89.2%. Ratings were determinable on the fifth and the seventh days of treatment in 24 and 21 cases, respectively, with all the cases judged good or excellent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  - Bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. A total of 76% of the secretions were positive. The most common pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (50%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. The staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. Other aerobic species were found only occasionally. Anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. In one-half of these, a low concentration of Propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). Only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. The high recovery of H. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 H. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus in non pregnant or pregnant women were investigated employing the standard blood agar plates. Antibacterial activity of lysozyme and combined effect of lysozyme with cefmetazole (CMZ) were also investigated. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Cervical mucus had an antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, but had no antibacterial activity to any other organisms tested. When cervical mucus was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was lost. 2. Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus combined with CMZ were obtained against Streptococcus pyogenes only, and no effect was observed against other organisms. 3. Lysozyme had an antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, but when combined with CMZ no antibacterial activity was observed.
TI  - Pyomyositis presenting as septic arthritis. A report of 2 cases.
AB  - Two cases of pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle presented in a fashion that initially suggested a diagnosis of septic arthritis. One infection was caused by Staphylococcus aureus, but the other was caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which is rarely implicated in pyomyositis. We note that the number of reported cases of pyomyositis in temperate climates has increased in recent years.
TI  - Oral absorption of cephalosporin antibiotics. 3. Synthesis and biological properties of 7 alpha-methoxy-7 beta-(arylacetamido)-3-chloro-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of 7 alpha-methoxy-7 beta-amido-3-chloro-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acids was prepared and evaluated for biological activity. When compared with the parent 7-non-methoxy analogues, these new 7 alpha-methoxy-3-chloro cephalosporins displayed diminished antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Once-daily administration of ceftriaxone for the treatment of selected serious bacterial infections in children.
AB  - Ceftriaxone treatment (50 to 80 mg/kg once daily) was given to 201 children between 1 month and 18 years of age. There were 201 serious bacterial infections, including epiglottitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, and meningitis. The common pathogens responsible for pediatric infections isolated from these patients included Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The overall clinic cure rate was 94%. Ten patients were clinically improved but not cured. There were two clinical failures. Bacteriologic failure occurred in six patients. The overall bacteriologic cure rate was 97%. Twenty patients (10%) experienced adverse effects; none required discontinuation of therapy. The efficacy, safety, spectrum, and convenience of ceftriaxone monotherapy make this antimicrobial agent a candidate for the treatment of choice of selected serious pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (ABPC) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (SBT) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. SBTPC is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide ABPC and SBT for systemic circulation. In the present study, the antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against 50 isolates each of 6 species (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-Lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (PCG) of cefazolin (CEZ) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: S. aureus 86%; K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; B. catarrhalis 68%; H. influenzae 24%. Fourteen per cent of S. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both PCG and CEZ acidometry discs. SBTPC, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. Good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (PCase). Average MIC80 values of SBTPC were 3.13 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for S. pyogenes. As SBTPC was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against PCase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of SBTPC compared to ABPC alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by SBT which, as noted above, is a component of SBTPC in an equimolar ratio to ABPC.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - Periorbital cellulitis. Clinical and laboratory findings in 146 episodes, including tear countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in 89 episodes.
AB  - Medical records of 144 children hospitalized for 146 episodes of periorbital cellulitis were reviewed. During 44 episodes, systemically administered antibiotics were given before hospitalization. Bacterial pathogens were isolated in only two (5%) of 44 episodes in pretreated patients compared with 33 (32%) of 102 episodes in patients who were not pretreated. Thirty-one children who were not pretreated were bacteremic. Compared with nonbacteremic children who were not pretreated, bacteremic children were younger, more often had a history of upper respiratory tract infection and fever, had a higher white blood cell count and temperature at admission, and more often had a violaceous cellulitis. No difference between groups existed in the frequency of a history of trauma or a local lesion near the affected eye. Tear specimens from 13 of 89 children tested by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to detect Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide were positive. Compared with positive blood culture results, tear CIE has a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 93%. Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were not detected by CIE.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity after administration of erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate to healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a crossover design study, we compared the plasma bactericidal activities of erythromycin estolate (500 mg) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (600 mg) after administration of a single oral dose to 12 healthy volunteers. Both erythromycin esters displayed very good plasma bactericidal activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The median bactericidal titers produced in plasma against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly higher with erythromycin estolate than with the ethylsuccinate ester at both 2 and 8 h after dosing (P less than 0.05 by Student's t test). Both erythromycin esters showed rather weak bactericidal activity against Branhamella catarrhalis; a further look at these results indicated that erythromycin estolate presented 50% of the plasma samples at 2 h with bactericidal titers superior or equal to 1:8, versus 11% for the ethylsuccinate ester. Of the 60 plasma bactericidal activity tests performed against Staphylococcus aureus, only 6 (10%) and 3 (5%) exhibited titers of 1:8 or greater for erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate, respectively. Clinical trials are warranted in which these products are compared in infections other than Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis, for which the clinical superiority of erythromycin estolate has been demonstrated.
TI  - Use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  - Ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. Trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. The current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. The experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. Empiric single agent or combination agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. The most important organisms known to cause these infections are Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. Chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the Enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora. The management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. Supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. Restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. Further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.
TI  - Effect of spiramycin on adhesiveness and phagocytosis of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Three strains of Staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, Cowan I and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, Str, mutans, Str. sanguis and Str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). Pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the MIC), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. Exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the MIC of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of PMNs. Pretreatment of PMNs with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. Action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. Although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different Gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of PMNs.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of a new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin.
AB  - The new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin, SPA-S-565, was shown to exert an effective antibacterial activity in vitro comparable to that of rifampicin. In fact, the antibacterial activity of SPA-S-565 against numerous Gram-positive cocci belonging to Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species as well as against 20 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was similar to that of rifampicin. In Swiss albino mice intraperitoneally infected with Staphylococcus aureus Oxford strain or Streptococcus pyogenes, the protective activity of SPA-S-565 and rifampicin was quite remarkable, and no significant difference was noted between the two antibiotics. In M. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with the antibacterial agents every seven days, the protection exerted by SPA-S-565 was significantly greater than that exerted by rifampicin.
TI  - Synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by Bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with Neisseria gonorrhoea, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Str. faecalis. The in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the MICs with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. The MICs of metronidazole for B. melaninogenicus, B. fragilis and B. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. The in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. Combined therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of Bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. The synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin in pediatric fields].
AB  - We have carried out laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM, TMS-19-Q). The results are summarized as follows. Serum and urinary concentrations of RKM were determined in 6 children with ages between 6 and 12 years given single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Mean serum concentrations peaked at 30 minutes after administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 0.30 microgram/ml, 0.79 microgram/ml and 1.32 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives for 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg were 2.0 hours, 1.65 hours and 1.36 hours. The 6-hour urinary recovery ranged from 1.11% to 2.58% after administration of 5 mg/kg, and the mean 6-hour urinary recoveries were 1.35% after administration of 10 mg/kg and 2.28% after administration of 15 mg/kg. Therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 22 (73.3%) of the children, comprising 6 with tonsillitis, 2 with pharyngitis, 4 with bronchitis, 1 with bronchopneumonia, 1 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 2 with whooping cough, 5 with streptococcal infections, 5 with Campylobacter enteritis, 3 with impetigo and 1 with SSSS. The microbiological effectiveness of RKM on identified pathogens comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 5 strains of Campylobacter spp. was not so satisfactory as evidenced by a eradication rate of 50.0%. No significant side effect due to the drug was observed in any cases. In conclusion, RKM was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Studies on susceptibility of isolated organisms from pediatric infections against various antimicrobial agents].
AB  - Twelve oral antimicrobial agents were tested for their antimicrobial activities against causative organisms isolated from pediatric infections. Activities of these antimicrobial agents against Streptococcus pyogenes were also examined in relation to T-antigen typing of the species. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows. 1. Against Staphylococcus aureus, rokitamycin (RKM), josamycin, ofloxacin, minocycline exhibited strong antimicrobial activities, and few strains of S. aureus showed resistance to these antimicrobial agents. More strains exhibited resistance to erythromycin (EM) than to other macrolide antibiotics (MLs) examined. Amoxicillin (AMPC)-resistance was often observed also. 2. Against S. pyogenes, beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and RKM had MIC80 of 0.20 microgram/ml or below, and no resistant strains of this organism were observed against these antibiotics. Only 2 resistant strains (2.0%) of S. pyogenes to MLs were detected, but resistance to tetracyclines (TCs) was observed at a high frequency, with 71.4% or more strains among T-4, T-6, T-12 and T-28 antigen types exhibited resistance to TCs. Among the 21 strains of T-12 antigen type examined, only one strain (4.8%) was found resistant to MLs. These observations suggested that the reduction in the frequency of ML-resistant strains was not due to the reduction in the number of T-12 antigen type strains but due to losses of resistance factors against MLs of plasmids. 3. Antibacterial activities of beta-lactams and MLs against Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were good, similarly to activities against S. pyogenes. But many strains of S. pneumoniae were resistant to TCs. 4. New quinolone antimicrobial agents (quinolones) showed excellent activities against Branhamella catarrhalis strains with EM and RKM showing the next best activities. The number of resistant strains against quinolones, however, seemed to be on an increase. 5. Quinolones had strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, few strains of which showed resistance to quinolones. AMPC had the next best activity, but approximately 10% of H. influenzae exhibited resistance to this antibiotic. 6. Against Campylobacter spp., quinolones and MLs showed the best activities with MIC80 values at or below 0.25 microgram/ml, and no resistant strains of the species against these antimicrobial agents were observed. Fosfomycin and TCs showed somewhat inferior activities to quinolones and MLs, with beta-lactams showing still lower activities. 7. Only few strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis were examined, but MLs and TCs appeared to be effective against these organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A clinical study of rokitamycin in pediatrics].
AB  - A total of 29 patients with pediatric infections was treated orally with 21.4-44.4 mg/kg/day of rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Clinical responses to RKM in 24 evaluable patients were excellent in 2 and good in 3 of 5 patients with tonsillitis and laryngitis; excellent in 3 and good in 5 of 8 patients with bronchitis; excellent in 3, good in 2 and fair in one of 6 patients with bronchopneumonia; excellent in 2 and good in the other of 3 patients with psittacosis; and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with Campylobacter colitis. The overall efficacy rate was 95.8%. 2. Bacteriological responses to the drug were: reduction in 1 and no change in the other of 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes; eradication of a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus; eradication of 2 and no change in 3 of 5 strains of Haemophilus influenzae; and eradication of 2 out of 2 strains of Campylobacter spp. 3. Diarrhea was complained of as an adverse reaction to the RKM medication by 1 patient, abdominal pain was reported by another, and anorexia by another of the 27 patients treated. Laboratory examination was performed on some patients, but not abnormal test values were found except in 1 case showing an increase in platelet count from 27.6 to 78.2 X 10(4)/mm8. The results suggested that RKM dry syrup might be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.
TI  - [Appraisal of rokitamycin in the pediatric field].
AB  - In a study of rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup for its usefulness in pediatric infections, the following results were obtained: 1. Frequencies of RKM-resistant strains among fresh isolates from sick children were very low, and 4.4% of 68 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 4.2% of 48 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and none of 96 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were found to be RKM-resistant. 2. Hypo- to achlorhydria was found in 2 (3.77%) of 53 children. 3. When children were administered once orally with 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of RKM dry syrup at fasting, mean peak values of plasma concentration were 0.25, 0.55 and 0.74 micrograms/ml with a T1/2 (beta) of 2.18, 1.97 and 2.00 hours, respectively. Urinary recovery rates during the first 0-6 hours were quite low, and values were 1.21, 1.38 and 2.23%, respectively. 4. The clinical efficacy of RKM dry syrup was studied on children chiefly with acute pneumonia, mycoplasmal pneumonia and tonsillitis. Among 379 children from whom pathogens had been determined, responses to the treatment were excellent in 186, good in 144, fair in 24, poor in 20 and unknown in 5 patients, the overall efficacy rate being 88.2%. Among all 598 treated patients, including those with undetermined pathogens, responses were excellent in 247, good in 269, fair in 42, poor in 35 and unknown in 5 patients, the efficacy rate being 87.0%. 5. The clinical efficacy of the drug in treating Chlamydia infection in 12 patients including a Chlamydia carrier and the clinical efficacy in treating Campylobacter enteritis in 36 patients were studied. All the cases showed "good" responses. Among 66 patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia, responses were excellent in 33 and good in 27 patients, with an efficacy rate of 90.9%. 6. The optimal dose of RKM dry syrup seemed to be in the range between 20 and 40 mg/kg. It appeared, however, that a dose of about 40 mg/kg would be required to eradicate the pathogen from the pharynx in S. pyogenes infection. 7. Adverse reactions to RKM dry syrup were found in 9 (1.45%) of 622 patients. The reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms except eruption occurred in 1 patient, but they were all mild. Laboratory examinations revealed eosinophilia in 19 and abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in 8 of 455 patients studied, but such abnormalities were all transient and mild.
TI  - Comparative study of cephalexin hydrochloride and cephalexin monohydrate in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - In two prospective, randomized multicenter double-blind studies with a dosage of  either 250 mg given four times a day (study A) or 500 mg given two times a day (study B), the comparative efficacy and safety of cephalexin hydrochloride (LY061188; Keftab) and cephalexin monohydrate (Keflex) for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections were determined. In study A, 97 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 101 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. In study B, 75 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 70 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. Diagnoses included abscesses, cellulitis, wound infections, and infected dermatitis, and were comparable in the different treatment groups. Pathogens were isolated from 82% of patients enrolled; the majority of isolates were of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, other staphylococcal species, and a few gram-negative bacteria. In study A, 68 of 71 (95.7%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 73 of 81 (90%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also responded satisfactorily. In study B, 56 of 58 (96.5%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 47 of 50 (94%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also responded satisfactorily. An adverse clinical event leading to discontinuation of the treatment drug developed in 17 of 343 (4.95%) patients in both studies. No differences were noted between the two drugs. Skin eruptions, pruritus, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms were the common adverse effects. These data suggest that cephalexin hydrochloride, a new formulation of cephalexin, is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent for treatment of a variety of skin and subcutaneous infections in a dosage of either 250 mg four times a day or 500 mg twice a day.
TI  - Comparison of the microbiology of group A and non-group A streptococcal tonsillitis.
AB  - We studied the microbial flora of tonsils removed from 20 children who suffered from recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillitis and 20 who had tonsillar hypertrophy following recurrent non-GABHS tonsillitis. Similar polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered from the cores of the tonsils in each group. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were recovered more often in the group with GABHS. This difference was due mostly to the lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Branhamella catarrhalis and Bacteroides sp in hypertrophic tonsils following non-GABHS tonsillitis. beta-Lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus was found with equal frequency in both groups. These findings demonstrate that although BLPB are recovered more often in recurrently inflamed tonsils following GABHS infection, BLPB also can be found in hypertrophic tonsils following non-GABHS tonsillitis.
TI  - Pyoderma pathophysiology and management.
AB  - Cutaneous infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major complications of epidermolysis bullosa. Application of impermeable occlusive dressings over denuded skin colonized with these bacteria results in rapid multiplication and the hazard of severe pyoderma. Approaches to the prophylactic treatment of these infections during the long-term management of epidermolysis bullosa are considered.
TI  - Impetigo contagiosa: a comparison of erythromycin and dicloxacillin therapy.
AB  - One hundred patients with impetigo were prospectively enrolled in a study to determine the current etiology and comparative therapeutic efficacy of two oral antimicrobial agents active against both group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABS) and Staphylococcus aureus. After obtaining a bacterial culture from a representative impetiginous lesion, the children were randomized to receive 10 days of either erythromycin (40 mg/kg/day) or dicloxacillin (25 mg/kg/day). S. aureus alone was isolated from 46 children, and in association with GABS from 25 children. GABS alone was isolated from nine patients. Of the 59 evaluable children with S. aureus isolates, 28 of 29 treated with erythromycin and 29 of 30 treated with dicloxacillin were cured or improved on follow-up examination. Thus, we conclude that erythromycin is the drug of choice for impetigo in our midwestern locale because of its high efficacy and relatively low cost.
TI  - Rarity of tylosin resistance in human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Of 3812 human cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Campylobacter species only 1.0 per cent were resistant to tylosin, an antibiotic used extensively in animals but not in man. There was no evidence for a significant animal source of these resistant cultures, a result which provides further evidence for the rarity of the flow of resistant organisms (or their genes) from animal sources to human beings.
TI  - Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without pharyngitis.
AB  - The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and other treatable organisms was studied in children with and without pharyngitis. Children aged 2 to 12 years were evaluated between November 1985 and April 1986 in three family practice offices in the Salt Lake City area. Chlamydia trachomatis was not detected in the pharynx of any of the children studied. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was cultured from 5 percent of the 242 children studied, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 30 percent, non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from 5 percent, Hemophilus influenzae from 4 percent, and Staphylococcus aureus from 14 percent. The symptoms reported were not statistically associated with any organism isolated, and clinical signs of pharyngitis were associated only with the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Based on these results, management of pharyngitis in children should continue to be based on the detection and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

TI  - Antimicrobial properties of peptides from Xenopus granular gland secretions.
AB  - Previously, we described a family of novel broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides, magainins, from the skin of Xenopus laevis. In this report we show that at least two other Xenopus peptides, present in the skin and its secretions, PGLa and a peptide released from the xenopsin precursor, exhibit antimicrobial properties comparable to the magainins. The identification of these newer members provides insight into the structural diversity of vertebrate antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of the new macrolide flurithromycin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The activity of flurithromycin against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the agar dilution method. Flurithromycin showed high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90 = 0.032-0.25 mg/l). Its MIC90 value against Haemophilus influenzae strains was 4.0 mg/l and 16 mg/l against Staphylococcus aureus strains. Flurithromycin has promising antibacterial activity which warrants clinical trials.

TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of common pediatric pathogens to LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a carbacephem antibiotic for oral administration with an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of cefaclor and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. It has greater stability than cefaclor and greater activity against beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. LY163892 is less active than amoxicillin against streptococci and less active than amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against Branhamella catarrhalis but comparable against other pathogens.
TI  - In vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. We demonstrated and standardized the in vivo PAE in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant PAEs. Against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce PAEs against streptococci. With few exceptions the in vivo PAE correlated well with the PAE reported in prior in vitro studies. Residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the PAE. Theoretically, the presence of a PAE may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of norfloxacin in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a new quinolone antibacterial agent, was investigated for its antibacterial activity and clinical efficacy on respiratory tract infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Antibacterial activities were evaluated against 127 strains of various bacteria isolated from clinical sources. MIC80's of this drug were: against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes 1.56 micrograms/ml; Haemophilus influenzae 0.05 microgram/ml or less; and Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. 0.10 microgram/ml. These antibacterial activities were superior to these of ampicillin and cephalexin, except against S. pyogenes. 2. Clinical responses to NFLX in a total of 32 cases with respiratory tract infections were excellent in 9 cases, good in 12, fair in 9, poor in 2, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormalities of laboratory test results were observed.
TI  - A-61827 (A-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-61827 (A-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of A-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The MICs of A-61827 for 90% of strains (MIC90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. The MIC90S of A-61827 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than A-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of A-61827 per ml. The MIC90 of A-61827 for Legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. A-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. The MIC90 of A-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. In mouse protection tests, A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse Bacteroides fragilis abscess model. After oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of A-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
TI  - Hemagglutination activity and localization of Fc receptor of group A and G streptococci.
AB  - The IgG-Fc binding activity and binding sites on the cell surface of streptococci, strains AR1 (group A) and G148 (group G), and Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I were examined by hemagglutination (HA) and immunoelectron microscopic methods. No distinct difference was observed in the HA activity among these three strains. However, the strains differed in the distribution of Fc receptor. Cowan I cells (having protein A) were heavily covered with two layers of ferritin particles, whereas AR1 cells were heavily covered with a single, rough layer of ferritin particles. G148 cells (having protein G) were labeled with a relatively thin, rough ferritin layer. The trypsin susceptibility of the Fc receptors of the AR1 strain was much higher than that of the G148 strain. These results suggest that both streptococcal strains are distinctly different in the arrangement or in the conformation of the Fc receptor from the Cowan I strain. It is also suggested that the Fc receptor molecules of the streptococcal strains differ from each other not only in conformation but also in trypsin susceptibility.
TI  - Molecular interactions between human IgG, IgM rheumatoid factor and streptococcal IgG Fc receptors.
AB  - Group A streptococci type M15 were previously shown to bind both human IgG via the Fc component and a purified monoclonal IgM kappa rheumatoid factor (IgM RF). Using 125I-labelled IgG and 125I-labelled IgM RF, the present study gave association constants of 2.2 x 10(7) and 2.9 x 10(8) M-1, respectively. The binding of 125I-IgG to the streptococci was inhibited by unlabelled IgG, IgG Fc and fragment D of staphylococcal protein A but not by the IgM RF or F(ab')2 of anti-idiotype antibodies to RF (anti-Id RF). Inversely, unlabelled IgM RF and anti-Id RF inhibited the binding of 125I-IgM RF markedly and unlabelled human IgG and IgG Fc only slightly or moderately, respectively. Thus, group A streptococci type M15 showed different binding sites for IgG Fc and the antibody combining sites of a human monoclonal RF. The findings were still more complex on a background of previous reports showing that streptococcal IgG Fc receptors and RFs bind to the same amino acids on the Fc molecule. This complex pattern may play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
TI  - The immunology of tonsils in children: the effect of bacterial load on the presence of B- and T-cell subsets.
AB  - Tonsil core specimens of 54 children, (3 to 12 years) with clinical evidence of chronic tonsillitis and/or "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy, were studied for the effect of the magnitude of aerobic bacterial load on tonsil size and the absolute numbers of B- and T-cell subsets. Tonsillar core specimens obtained from ten children with no history of ear, nose, or throat infections and normal appearing tonsils served as controls. The findings of this study indicate that tonsil size was directly proportional to the mean bacterial load in colony forming units/g tonsil (CFU/g) even in the absence of a clinical history of infection (p less than 0.01). A mean bacterial load of 2.4 +/- 2.1 X 10(5) CFU/g tonsil was seen in diseased tonsils as compared to 1.6 +/- 2.4 X 10(4) CFU/g tonsil in normal controls (p less than 0.01). Hemophilus influenzae (type B and non-B), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were the most common pathogens recovered in the largest numbers from diseased tonsils; control tonsils harbored few bacteria in their cores. The absolute number of immunocompetent cells/g tonsil including T-helper, T-suppressor and B-cells (S-Ig+), were significantly greater in diseased tonsils than in controls (p less than 0.001). Increasing microbial load (CFU/g tonsil) correlated with increased numbers of T-helper (p less than 0.01) and B-cells (p less than 0.01). These data strongly support a bacterial etiology for chronic tonsillitis as well as "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy. Bacterial induced proliferation of immunocompetent cells may be one underlying mechanism for chronic tonsillar disease in children.
TI  - Correlation of in vitro activities of the fluoroquinolones to their in vivo efficacies.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. Norfloxacin (N), pefloxacin (P), enoxacin (E), ofloxacin (O), difloxacin (D), ciprofloxacin (C), fleroxacin (F), A-61827 (A), temafloxacin (T) and lomefloxacin (L) were used in these studies. In vitro, C was the most active compound against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and A was the most active compound against Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. In mouse protection tests, C, D, A, O, T and F had similar activities against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D, T and A were the most active quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and Strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. D was the most active agent against intracellular infection with Salmonella typhimurium, followed by O, T, A and F. The other compounds were ineffective in this test. All the quinolones were effective in treating E. coli pyelonephritis in mice. The doses required to treat P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis in mice were four times greater than those required to treat E. coli. Resistant P. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. Systemic infections with E. coli, Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and F, T and A were ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa in this model. Differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Experimental and clinical studies of causative bacteria in tonsillitis.
AB  - To study the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections, we focused on acute tonsillitis and performed three experimental and clinical studies. From these studies, we found out that there seemed to be an intimate relationship between anatomical structure and adherence of S. pyogenes, and we confirmed that the M protein of S. pyogenes played an important role in adherence to the epithelium and the normal bacterial flora was actively involved in the body's defense against infections. We also identified that nearly half of causative bacteria in tonsillitis in Japan were the genus streptococcus, especially S. pyogenes with 23.4%. The incidence of Methicillin (DMPPC)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 27% in middle ear exudate and 14.3% in nasal discharge, but no MRSA was isolated from tonsillitis.
TI  - [Evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of local fusidic aid versus oral dicloxacillin in infections of the skin].
AB  - In a double-blind test it was shown the efficacy of topical fusidic acid in comparison with oral dicloxacillin, in patients with skin infection by Staphylococcus aureus or/and Streptococcus pyogenes. In the experimental group, 16 patients from 20 received 2% topical fusidic acid in cream and reacted well in a shorter period of time than 17 from a group of 20 that had 500 mg. of dicloxacillin orally twice a day.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal skin infections in a US meat-packing plant.
AB  - In 1985, the second reported outbreak of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) skin infections among US meat packers was recognized at an Oregon meat-packing plant. All 69 plant workers were interviewed and examined for the presence of pustular, draining, or inflamed lesions. During a three-month period, 44 episodes of skin infection occurred in 32 workers, all but four of whom worked in boning or killing areas. Acquiring infection was associated with job category (relative risk [RR], 5.7; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 2.9 to 11.3) and having at least two hand lacerations (RR adjusted for occupation, 6.2; 95% CI, 3.0 to 12.5). Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (18), Staphylococcus aureus (12), or both (20) were isolated from 70 lesions cultured. Meat is suspected as a vehicle of transmission because cultures of two meat specimens contained the same GABHS strain as did 24 isolates from patients. Increasing reports of GABHS skin infections in meat packers suggest that this occupational risk may be more common than is realized.
TI  - Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis and reconstructive ear surgery.
AB  - This paper reports a multicentre, controlled, blind, prospective, randomized study into the use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics in myringoplasty surgery. Seventy-one individuals were clinically and bacteriologically assessed both preoperatively, and for a period of 8 weeks postoperatively. The results showed that antibiotic prophylaxis did not eradicate bacterial pathogens already present in preoperative ears, nor did it prevent their development during the postoperative period. The observation that an ear was wet or dry gave no indication of the actual presence or absence of pathogenic organisms.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - Effect of prophylactic antibiotics upon mixed infections with Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A streptococci and Escherichia coli. The infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. Mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. Infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or Escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (CFU) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. Clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the CFU of both components of mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis with either Staphylococcus aureus or Group A streptococci. Cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. These data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies with azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new macrolide with an extended half-life and excellent tissue distribution.
AB  - Azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide, was well  absorbed following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. This compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. This extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. The significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. Azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae or susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the H. influenzae challenge. Azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. In mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by Salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and Staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. The oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, or S. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of S. aureus infection. These properties of azithromycin strongly support the further evaluation of this new macrolide for use in community-acquired infections of skin or soft tissue and respiratory diseases.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies evoked by the free oligopeptide (Gly)5 reacting specifically with peptidoglycan from staphylococci.
AB  - Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with the Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PG) epitope (Gly)5 were obtained using the synthetic oligopeptide (Gly)5 in its free form as immunogen. The selected monoclonal antibodies were of the IgM kappa isotype and reacted specifically with PG from S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but gave no reaction with PG from Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Affinity chromatography showed that the antibodies were reactive with the N-terminus of the (Gly)5 peptide. These monoclonal antibodies can be used for the detection of staphylococcal PG in solution.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of roxithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin against selected gram-positive bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Recent experimental work has shown that a so-called PAE (postantibiotic effect, i.e. persistent suppression of regrowth after short exposure of bacteria to the study drug in vitro) is a feature of most current antibiotics. However, marked quantitative differences were found between different types of antibiotics and also between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms studied. A PAE has not yet been demonstrated for roxithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic. Therefore, we compared the PAE of roxithromycin, erythromycin, and clindamycin against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae in vitro. Identical multiples of the MIC and identical exposure times resulted in similar PAEs for the three study drugs tested. Good correlations could be found between the area under the in-vitro concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) and PAEs. The longest PAE of 9.6 h was observed after exposure of Str. pneumoniae to 1.9 mg/l of roxithromycin for 6 h.

TI  - Impetigo: a reassessment of etiology and therapy.
AB  - Traditional concepts regarding the bacteriology and therapy of nonbullous impetigo have been reexamined. Although in the United States the disease is considered primarily of streptococcal origin and amenable to penicillin therapy, we found that Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate in 71 patients studied. Only two patients yielded pure cultures of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. All but two isolates of S. aureus were resistant to penicillin; one of these two isolates was also resistant to erythromycin. Erythromycin appeared to be more efficacious than penicillin for the treatment of impetigo.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l). Among other Gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to A-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. A-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against Pasteurella multocida and Campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against Legionella spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/l) and Bact. melaninogenicus (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). Activity of A-56268 was pH dependent (more active at pH 7 than at pH 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. The drug was bactericidal against two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Str. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. BMY-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BMY-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100, including bactericidal activity, against Staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Bacterial adherence: the attachment of group A streptococci to mucosal surfaces.
AB  - It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. After the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced-fit) fashion with complementary receptors on mucosal surfaces of the host. The adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. In group A streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored to one or more proteins on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. In an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin recognized by LTA and group A streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture adsorbed with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococci adsorbed several high-molecular-weight fragments as well as a 28-kilodalton and a 23-kilodalton fragment, whereas S. pyogenes cells adsorbed only the 28-kilodalton fragment completely. The adsorption of the fragments by S. pyogenes was blocked by LTA. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide copying the NH2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a western blot with the 28-kilodalton fragment; this result indicated that S. pyogenes and its LTA react with the NH2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site distinct from that at which S. aureus reacts. Our findings are consistent with the idea that LTA mediates the attachment of group A streptococci to fatty acid binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from skin and soft tissue lesions.
AB  - The pathogens most often isolated from lesions in skin and soft tissues were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cultures from venous leg ulcers, decubitus ulcers and infectious gangrene often yielded also Pseudomonas spp., enterobacteria and enterococci. Obligate anaerobes were frequently isolated especially from abscesses and decubitus ulcers. One third of the abscesses and half of the decubitus ulcers yielded obligate anaerobes.
TI  - Response of Streptococcus pyogenes to therapy with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in a mouse model of mixed infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The response of Streptococcus pyogenes to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin; Beecham Group) therapy of a mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal infection was studied in a surgical wound in mice. A superficial wound was produced on the backs of anesthetized mice, and a suture infected with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, or a mixed inoculum of both organisms was inserted. Oral therapy was started 4 h after infection and continued for 3 days. Both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were effective in eliminating the streptococci from the pure wound infection. In contrast, amoxicillin failed to eliminate the streptococci from a mixed infection in which a beta-lactamase-producing strain of S. aureus was also present, wound counts reaching 10(7) streptococci per wound by 80 h, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanic acid reduced the count to less than 33 streptococci per wound by 24 h. Numbers of S. aureus were also reduced by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy, controlling the infection, whereas amoxicillin was ineffective. Also of significance was the fact that successful therapy was achieved with blood and tissue concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of the same order as those measured in humans. These results show that amoxicillin therapy failed to eliminate S. pyogenes from a wound infection in the presence of a beta-lactamase-producing strain of S. aureus and suggest the potential of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of mixed bacterial skin infections involving beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  - A three-year study of impetigo in Sydney.
AB  - Two hundred and forty-three cases of impetigo, which were seen in children in Sydney in the three-year period from July, 1983 to June, 1986, were studied. The great majority of cases was seen in summer and autumn, and over half the cases occurred in the preschool age group. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from 86% of the cases; in 69% of cases it was the only organism to be found, indicating the predominant importance of this organism in impetigo in Sydney in the 1980s. Antibiotic-sensitivity testing of the staphylococci that were cultured demonstrated that fewer than 2% of strains were sensitive to penicillin and fewer than 50% of strains were sensitive to erythromycin. Our experience suggests that flucloxacillin is the antibiotic agent of choice in the treatment of impetigo in children in Sydney.
TI  - Interactions of fibronectin with streptococci: the role of fibronectin as a receptor for Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Current evidence suggests that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes is centrally involved in the adherence of these bacteria to the oral mucosa. The major receptor on the surface of buccal mucosal cells for S. pyogenes is fibronectin. Fibronectin is a complex glycoprotein found in blood, extracellular matrices, and saliva. Many species of streptococci bind to fibronectin, although the characteristics of these interactions are different. Furthermore, whereas LTA is an efficient inhibitor of the binding of fibronectin to group A streptococci, it has little ability to inhibit the binding of fibronectin to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. Studies conducted with fibronectin show that different bacteria bind to different sites. The ability of various bacteria to interact with different domains on the fibronectin molecule may play an important role in bacterial adherence and tissue tropism.

TI  - Mycotic carotid aneurysm.
AB  - Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery are rare; they usually appear as an enlarging pulsatile neck mass with associated pain, tenderness, and fever. This case report illustrates the need for prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention. The most common organisms found with these aneurysms have been Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. We report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from Salmonella enteritidis. A 20-year review of both the foreign and English language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from Salmonella infection. The cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. More recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. The present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.
TI  - Silicone oil as a reservoir for nosocomial infection.
AB  - Two episodes of infection with epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) associated with silicone oil baths are described. In vitro studies indicated that certain organisms, including EMRSA, can survive in silicone oil for several days. We conclude that the oil acted as a reservoir for continuing infection in our patients. We suggest routine care of silicone oil baths in order to prevent cross infection.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of acute otitis media in children. Therapeutic consequences].
AB  - One hundred children presenting with acute otitis media underwent a bacteriological study of otitis exudate over a 18 month period. The bacteria found were as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (24), Haemophilus influenzae (19), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Streptococcus pyogenes (7), Branhamella catarrhalis (3), and 18 Gram negative bacilli (including 7 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 enterobacteriaceae). One pathogenic bacterium was isolated in 56 cases, 2 or more in 12 cases and none in 32 cases. In the age categories 0-1 year (47 cases) and 1-3 years (31 cases), S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the main organisms found, followed by S. pyogenes in children older than 3 years (22 cases). With respect to the antibiotics used for treating otitis, 5/22 S. pneumoniae and 4/17 H. influenzae were erythromycin resistant (9/17 had an intermediate susceptibility) and 7/19 H. influenzae and 1/17 S. pneumoniae were cotrimoxazole resistant. None of the S. pneumoniae and 2/19 H. influenzae were ampicillin resistant. These 2 H. influenzae and 2/3 B. catarrhalis were beta-lactamase producers. They were sensitive to the combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.
TI  - Cloning and expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The genes encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type A (SPE A) and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were stably cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. In the non-pathogenic Bacillus background, the recombinant speA clone expressed 32-fold more SPE A than the native streptococcus, and similarly, the recombinant plasmid harboring tst expressed 4-fold more TSST-1 in Bacillus than in the native Staphylococcus aureus. The Bacillus-derived products were secreted into the culture fluid, were resistant to proteolytic degradation and their biological activities mimicked native preparations.
TI  - In vitro correlation of platelet aggregation with occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. The potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. The aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. None of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. Addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. These data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. The rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. These observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.

TI  - Paldimycins A and B and antibiotics 273a2 alpha and 273a2 beta. Synthesis and characterization.
AB  - Paldimycin (antibiotic 273a1) and antibiotic 273a2 as well as their individual components, paldimycins A (273a1 alpha) and B (273a1 beta) and antibiotics 273a2 alpha and 273a2 beta were synthesized from paulomycin, paulomycin A and paulomycin B, respectively, by reacting with N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The semisynthetic antibiotics had chromatographic behavior (TLC, HPLC) and physical and chemical properties identical to the properties of the corresponding antibiotics produced by Streptomyces paulus.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic, compared with  that of erythromycin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A-56268 is a new macrolide antibiotic that resembles erythromycin in its spectrum of activity. A-56268 and erythromycin had identical activities against Streptococcus pyogenes, group B, C, and G streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. Erythromycin and A-56268 had similar activities against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and group D enterococci. Like erythromycin, A-56268 was ineffective in inhibiting oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, oxacillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by A-56268 at concentrations similar to those of erythromycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - Specificity study of kits for detection of group A streptococci directly from throat swabs.
AB  - A total of 78 Streptococcus strains, 15 Staphylococcus strains, and 2 Stomatococcus strains were used to test the specificity of 18 different antigen detection systems for group A streptococci and five products that detect a specific enzyme associated with group A streptococci. All streptococcal strains possessing the group A antigen were correctly identified with 31 different lots of reagents in the 18 antigen detection systems. The specificities of the 31 different lots of reagents ranged between 88.5 and 100%. A limited number of nonspecific reactions were observed with Enterococcus gallinarium, group C Streptococcus strain C23, and Staphylococcus aureus F49 and Cowan 1. The antigen detection kits that used enzymes as the extraction reagent gave slightly more specific results than did the kits that used chemical extraction reagents. The reagents in the five kits designed to detect the enzyme pyroglutamic acid arylamidase in Streptococcus pyogenes reacted positively with S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus); however, the reagents also reacted positively with all group D enterococcal streptococci and with about half of the staphylococcal strains treated. The nonspecificity of tests based on pyroglutamic acid arylamidase detection would seem to limit the usefulness of these kits with mixed cultures.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - Immunologic cross-reactivity of type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) and staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C1.
AB  - Immunologic cross-reactivity between Streptococcus pyogenes type A exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins B and C1 was demonstrated by Ouchterlony double diffusion, Western immunoblot, and immunodot analyses. Specific antiserum to type A streptococcal exotoxin reacted more strongly with staphylococcal enterotoxin B than with enterotoxin C1. The reactivity of type A streptococcal exotoxin with antiserum to staphylococcal enterotoxin B was greater than that of antiserum to enterotoxin C1. These results suggest that a conserved domain is present in the three exotoxins, which most likely originated from a common evolutionary ancestor.
TI  - [Effect of metabolites on the human plasma concentration as total activity after  oral administration of rokitamycin. Comparison of three different bioassay methods].
AB  - Three different bioassay methods for rokitamycin (TMS-19-Q) were compared to each other in vitro and in vivo. Method I was a paper disc method using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the test organism in nutrient agar (pH 8.0), method II was a paper disc method using Streptococcus pyogenes Cook in brain heart infusion agar (pH 7.4) and method III was an agar well method using M. luteus ATCC 9341 in the agar medium provided in the Minimum Requirements for Antibiotic Products of Japan (pH 6.5). Ratios of relative potency of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites calculated from standard curves in human plasma using these bioassay methods, were 1.00:1.13:3.34:0.96 (TMS-19-Q:10"-OH-TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method I, 1.00:1.58:0.40 (TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method II and 1.00:0.51:0.86:0.114 (TMS-19-Q:10"-OH-TMS-19-Q:LM A7:LM V) in method III. The relative potency obtained from method I, generally used for macrolide antibiotics, greatly contradicted MIC values of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites against clinically isolated 190 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, the relative potency obtained from method III reflected closely MIC values of TMS-19-Q and its metabolites. Therefore, method III should be the most suitable bioassay method to measure the plasma concentration of TMS-19-Q. Plasma concentrations measured by these 3 different methods were compared to each other in vivo, after oral administration of TMS-19-Q at a dose of 1,200 mg to each of fasted healthy volunteers. Values obtained from method I were about 4.3 times higher than those method III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibodies to various bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans in human and rabbit sera.
AB  - Sera from patients with verified systemic staphylococcal infection contained antibodies reactive with peptidoglycan (PG) from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. The presence of anti-PG cross-reactive antibodies was verified in patient sera by inhibition studies with the various bacterial PGs. Antibodies to nonstaphylococcal PGs were also elevated in sera from rabbits immunized with S. aureus PG. Antibodies to S. aureus PG were removed with the synthetic peptide analogs of S. aureus PG, the L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, L-Lys-D-Ala, and (Gly)5 determinants, as well as with an S. aureus PG peptide fragment containing the determinants D-Ala-D-Ala and L-Lys-D-Ala. Isolated antibodies to the PG peptides, both synthetic and native, were reactive with S. aureus and S. epidermidis PGs. The antibodies to the D-Ala-D-Ala and the L-Lys-D-Ala determinants were also reactive with S. pyogenes PG, but not with PGs from M. lysodeikticus, B. subtilis, and E. coli.
TI  - [Etiology of erysipelas].
AB  - Bacterial cultures were taken from 31 patients by scarification from the dermal compartment of recent erysipelas foci. Pathogenic organisms were isolated from the dermis while cultures from the skin surface remained sterile in 5 patients; Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in 2 of these patients and Staphylococcus aureus in the other 3 patients. Our findings indicate that staphylococcal erysipelas does exist and we suppose that Staphylococcus aureus is able to induce erysipelas, above all in the presence of dysfunction of lymph vessels. When treatment with penicillin G is not successful, erysipelas caused by staphylococci has to be considered. In these cases treatment has to be changed to penicillinase-resistant penicillin.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide, compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 was determined and compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against a limited spectrum of 401 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. A-56268 was quite active against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci and was moderately active against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. A-56268 was consistently bactericidal only for S. pneumoniae. The activity of A-56268 was comparable to that of erythromycin against most organisms tested.
TI  - [Drug resistance of bacterial strains isolated from sows with the clinical picture of mastitis-metritis-agalactia].
AB  - The disk method with Ericson and Bauer's solid nutrient media were employed to ascertain the drug resistance of a total of 54 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 11 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 strains of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 7 strains of Streptococcus uberis, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 1 strain of Streptococcus disgalactiae isolated from utero-cervical exudate and milk samples of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA). It was found that gentamycin only suppressed 100 per cent of the strains. So far as the other chemotherapeutic agents were concerned the organisms showed a varying extent of resistance. After determining the sensitivity of the strains to drugs two groups of pigs (from which the strains referred to were isolated) were subject to treatment. All 20 sows of the first group were treated with oxytocin only, while the 446 animals of the second group were treated with gentamycin in combination with oxytocin. It was found that effective therapy in the case of MMA was impossible with the application of preparations on the base of the hind lobe of the pituitary only. It is necessary to use chemotherapeutic means tow which the isolated organisms are susceptible.
TI  - Activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group A type of Schleifer and Kandler's classification, with one exception (Arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. The complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group B type peptidoglycan, except those of Corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group A type peptidoglycan. Preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. A water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (SEPS), which was prepared from Staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. A peptidoglycan "monomer," SEPS-M, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of SEPS with endo-N-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. In conformity with this finding, neither synthetic N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) nor MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala activated the complement cascade. Among several lipophilic derivatives of MDP, 6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala (BH48-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala) and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDP (B30-MDP) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through the classical pathway, respectively. The finding that a D-isoasparagine analog of B30-MDP caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the activation of complement by B30-MDP is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.
TI  - [Microbial etiology of the MMA syndrome (mastitis-metritis-agalactia) in swine raised commercially].
AB  - A total of 147 uterine-cervical exudates and milk samples from 165 lobes of the mammary gland of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA) were studied microbiologically. It was found that greatest was the share of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus organisms taking part in the microbial etiology of the syndrome. Second ranked Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Corynebacterium pyogenes along with some aerobic sporulating bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CI934, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with coumermycin, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cl934, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was studied  against 314 strains of Gram-positive bacteria representing 6 genera: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. milleri, viridans streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Bacillus spp.; and compared with that of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ampicillin, coumermycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifapentine, LM 427, erythromycin, minocycline, tetracycline and clindamycin. The agar dilution method was used. Cl934 was very active in vitro, with MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l against most species tested, except for S. faecalis and M. fortuitum. It was usually 2 to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Cl934 was also tested by the killing curve method, alone and in combination with coumermycin. It was rapidly bactericidal against most species tested, including S. faecalis. A synergistic interaction was observed with coumermycin against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. milleri and S. faecalis. The only antagonistic interaction occurred against L. monocytogenes exposed to 8 X MIC of Cl934 with 2 X MIC of coumermycin.

TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - Opsonic and physicochemical characteristics of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - The composition and opsonizing activity of five commercially available immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (Venoglobulin I, Venilon, Gammagard, Polyglobin, and Sandoglobulin) were studied. The composition of these preparations does not differ very much as far as total protein, immunoglobulin class and IgG subclass concentrations are concerned. The only exceptions were that Veniglobulin I, Gammagard and Sandoglobulin contain IgA, which might cause side effects in patients with anti-IgA antibodies, Gammagard contains very little IgG4, and Venilon and Polyglobin contain no and almost no IgG3, respectively, which might explain their very low opsonic activity. It was found that Venilon and Gammagard activate complement in the ready-for-infusion state. The opsonic activity of Venoglobulin I, Sandoglobulin and Gammagard is about equal to that of inactivated serum: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli with K antigen, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus group B are well opsonized and E. coli without K antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae are poorly opsonized.
TI  - Chemotherapy of otitis media with ofloxacin.
AB  - This study evaluated the therapeutic role of ofloxacin in different forms of otitis media. After identifying the infecting bacteria in 250 patients with acute otitis media, or chronic otitis media, the clinical efficacy of orally administered ofloxacin 200mg twice daily was assessed in 45 patients from each of these groups. The clinical results were comparable with those obtained after conventional local and oral antibiotic therapy. Microbiological examination of the ear secretions revealed Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to be the main pathogens in acute otitis media, whereas in chronic otitis media P. aeruginosa and Proteus sp. were detected in most of the cases. Ofloxacin concentrations in secretions and mucosa specimens of the middle ear exceeded serum concentrations by more than 2-fold. On the basis of these preliminary results, ofloxacin appears to be an effective orally administered agent, without ototoxicity, which is effective against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 2 important pathogens in middle ear infections. Ofloxacin should be considered as an alternative for the therapy of otitis media, especially the chronic forms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  - Pyogenic arthritis in infants and children: a review of 95 cases.
AB  - The clinical and laboratory findings of 95 children with pyogenic arthritis were  reviewed to assess etiologic agents, diagnostic tools and results of therapy. Despite obtaining specimens from multiple sites for culture and using antigen detection tests only 64% of patients had an etiologic agent determined. Haemophilus influenzae type b was the most common causative agent identified and 82% of such cases occurred in children between 6 and 24 months of age. Infection due to Staphylococcus aureus was not confined to any age group. Results of laboratory tests which measure inflammatory response were not always abnormal. Platelet count and sedimentation rate frequently rose as clinical improvement occurred. Roentgenograms and radionuclide studies were of little benefit. Therapy included immediate decompression of the joint space, articular rest and use of antibiotics delivered parenterally. Ninety percent of 70 patients who were followed for 1 month to 5 years (mean, 15.5 months) were cured. Eight children had clinically significant sequelae which affected length of extremity, stability of articulations and range of movement. Development of sequelae was significantly associated with infection at age less than 6 months, delay of 4 or more days in institution of medical or surgery treatment, infection due to S. aureus and most strikingly the involvement of the hip or shoulder with concomitant presence of osteomyelitis.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of L-105, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - L-105 (sodium(-)-(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-methoxyimino- acetamido]-3-[1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-aza bicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate) is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative. The in-vitro antibacterial activity of L-105 against clinical isolates of 18 bacterial species was compared with those of cefmenoxime, cefoperazone and cefazolin. Its spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria was similar to that of cefmenoxime. Moreover, against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis, Str. pneumoniae and Str. pyogenes, L-105 was more potent than cefmenoxime and cefoperazone. Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staph. aureus which is comparatively resistant to most third-generation cephalosporins, it was nearly equal in potency to cefazolin. L-105 was stable to various penicillinases and cephalosporinases. However, this compound was slightly hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinases, i.e., the enzymes produced by Pseudomonas cepacia and Ps. maltophilia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and pethidine.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and pethidine in concentrations commonly used in epidural practice was studied by an agar dilution method against ten common micro-organisms. Both drugs showed increasing microbe inhibition with increasing drug concentrations. Bupivacaine at common epidural concentrations inhibited eight of the ten organisms and pethidine inhibited six. These findings confirm previous reports of microbe inhibition by bupivacaine, and in addition demonstrate a similar but slightly lesser activity by pethidine. Although antimicrobial activity of epidural drugs can be regarded as a desirable property, clinical implications of such findings remain unclear.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.

TI  - The value of needle aspiration in the management of cellulitis.
AB  - Needle aspirations from 103 young, healthy patients (mean age 22 years) with cellulitis were prospectively analyzed to determine the percentage yield and causative organisms. A standard technique of needle aspiration was performed using a 22-gauge needle, a 10-cc syringe, and 1 cc of sterile water. Aspirations were performed at the leading edge and midpoint of the cellulitis (halfway between the leading edge and the center of the cellulitis). Fifteen of the 103 patients (14.5 percent) had positive aspirates. Nine of the 103 aspirates were positive at the leading edge (8.7 percent) and 6 of 70 were positive at the midpoint (8.6 percent), giving a total aspiration positivity of 8.7 percent (15/173). The organisms recovered were Staphylococcus aureus (53 percent). Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 percent), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (13 percent) and Streptococcus pyogenes (7 percent). The low-percentage yield and predictable organisms recovered speak against needle aspiration being a necessary procedure in a young, healthy population. Similarly, the site of aspiration does not increase yield. Empiric treatment with antibiotics aimed at staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms is appropriate.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of a series of caespitin derivatives.
AB  - Chemical modification of the naturally occurring phlorophenone antimicrobial agent caespitin is described. These modifications include variations in the phenone side chain, substitution with prenyl, allyl, and benzyl in the 4-position of the phlorophenone nucleus, and ring cyclizations via etherification to give furan and chroman compounds. Several of these derivatives show enhanced in vitro potency over caespitin. Studies on the development of microbial resistance against these compounds show that no or very little resistance developed after several passes of these compounds in representative microbial strains.
TI  - Scrum kidney: epidemic pyoderma caused by a nephritogenic Streptococcus pyogenes  in a rugby team.
AB  - In December, 1984, an outbreak of pyoderma affected five scrum players in the St  Thomas' Hospital rugby team. The causative organism, Streptococcus pyogenes, was acquired during a match against a team experiencing an outbreak of impetigo, and was transmitted to two front row players of another team a week later, and to two girlfriends of affected St Thomas' players a month later. The strain was M-type 49, tetracycline-resistant, and virulent. It caused salpingitis in a girlfriend and acute glomerulonephritis in one rugby player. No case of subclinical glomerulonephritis was detected in eight patients with pyoderma. Screening of the St Thomas' Hospital team revealed four further cases of non-streptococcal skin infection, with evidence for contemporaneous spread of Staphylococcus aureus. Teams should not field players with sepsis, and it may be advisable to apply a skin antiseptic to traumatised skin after the match.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - [Isolation and characteristics of an antibacterial substance produced by a strain of Streptococcus sp. Thom-1606. A study of the biological activity of the metabolic products of Streptococcus sp. Thom-1606].
AB  - The data on the biological properties of the culture fluid of Streptococcus strain sp. TOM-1606 are presented. The native preparation has been shown to possess the capacity for stimulating the rate of the clearance of the peritoneal cavity of mice from Staphylococcus aureus cells, strain MT-1, rif. r., found to be insensitive to the action of the above-mentioned preparation in vitro. The crude preparation produces a transitory bacteriostatic effect on the streptococcal and staphylococcal strains under study. The preparation produces a prolonged bacteriostatic effect only on Micrococcus luteus test strain. All these data suggest that the crude preparation contains at least two active principles.
TI  - Effects of carbon dioxide upon the in vitro activity of erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. The plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% CO2 and air. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% CO2. The greatest differences in MIC values were found for H. influenzae; the MIC 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% CO2. Sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ICS) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% CO2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in CO2. The most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% CO2 was seen with the H. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. Sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.
TI  - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type A (scarlet fever toxin) is related to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type A (SPE A) was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The first 30 residues of the translation product represented a hydrophobic signal peptide. The mature protein was 220 amino acids in length and had a molecular weight of 25,805. It has significant protein sequence homology with Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B but not with other proteins in the Dayhoff library.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefixime in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefixime (CFIX) in children were done and the following results were obtained. Serum and urinary concentrations of CFIX were determined in 6 children aged 5 to 14 years given single doses of 1.5 or 6.0 mg/kg. Mean serum concentrations peaked at 4 hours after the administration of either 1.5 or 6.0 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 0.71 and 4.46 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives for the low and the high doses were 5.28 and 4.45 hours, respectively. The 12-hours urinary recovery ranged from 7.0 to 13.8% after administration of 1.5 mg/kg, and the 8-hours urinary recovery was 18.1% after administration of 6.0 mg/kg. Therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 43 (97.7%) of the children, comprising 13 with tonsillitis and 31 with scarlet fever. The microbiological effectiveness of CFIX on identified pathogens comprising 29 strains of S. pyogenes and 2 strains of S. aureus was satisfactory as evidence by a high eradication rate of 93.5%. No clinical side effects were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were elevation of GOT and/or GPT in 4 patients and eosinophilia in 1 patient. In conclusion, CFIX was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of a type II Fc receptor from a group A streptococcus.
AB  - A group A streptococcal strain rich in Fc receptors was selected by an immunoblotting technique and used as the source for isolation of a functionally active Fc receptor. A variety of extraction techniques were compared including (1) heat extraction at neutral, acid or alkaline pH, (2) treatment with the enzymes mutanolysin, hyaluronidase, trypsin, papain or phage lysin, or (3) autoclaving or heating in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The most homogeneous receptor was recovered following heat extraction and contained two molecular weight forms. The major form had a molecular weight of 56 000 daltons and the minor form had a molecular weight of 38 000 daltons. These two proteins could be isolated without loss of activity by binding to and elution from a column of immobilized human IgG. An antibody prepared against a single form of the affinity purified receptor demonstrated reactivity with both molecular weight forms of the heat extracted receptor. The group A receptor was found to be both antigenically and physicochemically distinct from either the type I receptor found on the majority of Staphylococcus aureus strains or the type III Fc receptors found on the majority of group C streptococcal strains.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) gene from Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage T12.
AB  - The gene specifying type A streptococcal exotoxin (speA), also known as erythrogenic toxin, was cloned from the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage T12 genome and analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. The speA gene consists of 753 base pairs and codes for a 29,244-molecular-weight protein. The speA gene product contains a putative 30-amino acid signal peptide, resulting in a molecular weight of 25,787 for the secreted protein. A possible promoter and ribosome-binding site are present in the region upstream from the speA gene, and a transcriptional terminator is located 69 bases downstream from the translational termination codon. The amino acid sequence of the carboxy-terminal portion of the type A streptococcal exotoxin exhibits extensive homology with the carboxy terminus of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins B and C1.
TI  - Influence of dipeptides on the interaction of immunoglobulins with bacterial Fc receptors.
AB  - Binding of radiolabeled human IgG to bacteria expressing type I, type II, or type III Fc receptors in the presence of glycyl-glycine, glycyl-tyrosine, glycyl-histidine, glycyl-leucine, or glycyl-phenylalanine was studied. No inhibition of labeled human IgG binding to type I or type III Fc receptor positive bacteria was observed by any of the dipeptides. Inhibition of binding of labeled human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4, but not IgG3, indicated the presence of two distinct Fc receptors associated with the type II Fc receptor-positive group A streptococcal strain.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Interaction between streptococcal IgG Fc receptors and human and rabbit IgG domains.
AB  - Groups A, C and G streptococci were tested for their ability to bind 125I-labelled fragments of human and rabbit IgG in order to localize their sites of interaction with IgG domains. Among the Group A streptococci, strains with IgG Fc receptors bound 85% of the added IgG Fc fragments in the test systems, whereas these strains showed practically no reactivity with F(ab')2, Facb (F(ab')2 + C gamma 2 domains) or pFc' (C gamma 3 domains). The Group C and Group G strains bound 48-100% of IgG Fc, but could also bind up to 36% of the added F(ab')2 in accordance with a previously described 'alternative' Fab reactivity. However, unlabelled IgG F(ab')2 or Facb showed no, or only slight, inhibitory capacity for the binding of 125I-labelled IgG Fc to the C and G strains. Collectively, these results indicate that Groups A, C and G streptococci require both the C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 domains for interaction with IgG, and most probably also bind in the interface region between the C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 domains as has been shown for staphylococcal protein A.
TI  - Release of fibronectin-lipoteichoic acid complexes from group A streptococci with penicillin.
AB  - Fibronectin binds to Streptococcus pyogenes, and this binding is inhibited by lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Previous studies have shown that LTA can be released from S. pyogenes by treatment with penicillin. Penicillin released LTA from both S. pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; however, the binding of fibronectin correlated with the amount of LTA released only in the case of S. pyogenes. Contrarily, clindamycin decreased the ability of S. aureus to bind fibronectin without affecting the binding of fibronectin to S. pyogenes. Further studies indicated that LTA does not inhibit the binding of fibronectin to S. aureus. Fibronectin bound to S. pyogenes could be released from the cell surface by penicillin. Immunological analysis of the released fibronectin indicated that LTA was the only surface component which could be detected as a soluble complex with the released fibronectin. These studies suggest that LTA plays a central role in the binding of fibronectin to S. pyogenes and is not involved in the binding of fibronectin to S. aureus.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary.
AB  - This survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by Public Health Network laboratories in 1983. Facultatively pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except Escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. Oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. In contrast to other streptococci, all Streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. The majority of the Gram-positive strains were resistant to tetracycline. A comparison to results reported earlier (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. Resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of Proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. Emergence of Haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of P. mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. The increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. In some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. A restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. Multiresistant Gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in Hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a representative clinical material. The frequent occurrence of multiresistant P. mirabilis and Acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. Surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant E. coli strains was very low. Amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.
TI  - Ofloxacin in oral chemotherapy of acute and chronic otitis media.
AB  - After ascertaining the bacterial spectrum in 210 patients with Otitis media acuta, Otitis media chronica mesotympanalis and Otitis media chronica epitympanalis, the clinical efficacy of oral therapy with ofloxacin in 40 patients from each of these groups was assessed. The clinical results are comparable with those following conventional local, oral and intravenous antibiotic therapy. The microbiological analysis of the ear secretions revealed Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae to be the main infectious agents of acute otitis media, whereas in chronic otitis media Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. could be detected in most of the cases. Ofloxacin levels of ear secretions, mucosa specimens of the middle ear and serum were measured in some patients by means of HPLC. In most cases, drug levels exceeded the MICs for the bacteria mentioned above. The correlation with the clinical results is discussed. On the basis of these preliminary results, ofloxacin can be considered as a highly efficient oral substance which is effective against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, two important pathogens of middle ear infections.
TI  - Semipermeable occlusive dressings. Effects on growth of pathogenic bacteria and reepithelialization of superficial wounds.
AB  - Six commercially available semiocclusive dressings were tested for their effect on the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria and the reepithelialization of experimentally induced wounds in human volunteers. Scarification and abrasion-type wounds inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were quantitatively cultured at different times after being covered with the dressings. Reepithelialization was assessed by serial stereomicrographs. None of the dressings was able to prevent clinical infection. All dressings provided microenvironments that were conducive to the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria. There was no difference in the rates of reepithelialization.
TI  - Microbial pathogens from goat mastitis and phage-typing of Staphylococcus aureus  isolates.
AB  - Examination of milk from goats yielded 41 strains from 40 clinically affected halves; 15 were Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Staph. epidermis, 1 Streptococcus agalactiae, 2 Strept. dysgalactiae, 5 Strept. uberis, 2 Corynebacterium pyogenes, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Pasteurella spp. and 4 Mycoplasma spp. One half had dual infection of Staph. aureus and Strept. dysgalactiae. Twenty two of the 297 milk samples from apparently normal halves also harboured pathogens comprising of 9 Staph. aureus, 1 Strept. agalactiae, 2 E. coli, 2 Pasteurella spp., 2 Candida albicans and 6 Mycoplasma spp. Most of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to many broad spectrum antibiotics. Twenty of the 24 Staph. aureus isolates were phase typable by a set of 23 human Staphylococcal International Phages suggesting the utility of these phages for the typing of goat strains. The isolates were grouped into 15 phage-types, many of which have been reported from human infections in Iraq. This indicates the possibility of association of human strains of Staph. aureus in caprine mastitis. No definite correlation could be noted between antibiogram and phage types of Staph. aureus strains.
TI  - Binding of IgM rheumatoid factor to group A, C and G streptococci with IgG Fc receptors.
AB  - The possibility that IgM rheumatoid factors bind to streptococci was studied. Using a sequence of Sephadex G200 gel filtration, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography and preparatory electrophoresis, IgM was isolated from the sera of 2 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and then radiolabelled with 125I. There was significant binding of radiolabelled IgM to group-A streptococci types M1, M15 and M22, and to a group-C and a group-G strain, all expressing IgG Fc receptors, but none to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli or to 11 other strains of streptococci without IgG Fc receptors. The radiolabelled IgM was separated by affinity chromatography on a column containing human IgG. Types M1 and M15 bound the fraction retained on the column, whereas M22 bound both this fraction and the non-retained fraction. Commercial human IgG, even at high concentrations, did not inhibit binding. The binding reaction, which is perhaps triggered either by the IgM rheumatoid factor or by IgG complexed with rheumatoid factor, could be a useful tool for removal of anti-immunoglobulin from the blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
TI  - Blocking of antibody complement-dependent effector functions by streptococcal IgG Fc-receptor and staphylococcal protein A.
AB  - Using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial IgG-binding substances, an Fc-receptor isolated from group A streptococci type M15, and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit IgG. When the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group A streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than Fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with Fc-binding activity. In no case was the lysis of IgM-coated cells inhibited. Opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal Fc-receptor and protein A impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group B streptococci (lacking IgG Fc-receptors). Furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. Our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to IgG is an important virulence mechanism in Fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - [Action of tomicide on bacterial cells. The bacteriostatic, bactericidal and bacteriolytic properties of tomicide].
AB  - The effect of the minimum bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentrations of native and concentrated tomicid on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus hemolyticus and Micrococcus was studied. It was shown that the bactericidal effect of tomicid was attained with the use of the doses 2-10 times higher than those required for the bacteriostatic effect. The minimum concentrations of tomicid effective against gram-positive cocci varied within the ranges described for the other biologically active substances of bacterial origin. The dose-dependent lytic effect of tomicid was studied. It was found that for lysis of the cells it was necessary to doses significantly exceeding the bactericidal ones.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid versus moxalactam therapy of osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  - A controlled, randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of ticarcillin  plus clavulanic acid with moxalactam was carried out in 25 evaluable patients with bone, joint, and skin or skin structure infections. Of the 13 patients in the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid-treated group, nine had osteomyelitis, two had septic arthritis, one had cellulitis, and one had a wound infection. Four of the 12 moxalactam-treated patients had osteomyelitis, one had septic arthritis, and the other seven had cellulitis and/or infected ulcers. A total of 21 causative organisms were isolated in the group treated with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid: Enterobacteriaceae (10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five), obligate anaerobes (three), Staphylococcus aureus (two), and Acinetobacter species (one). Cultures in the moxalactam-treated group yielded 23 pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae (seven), S. aureus (six), group B streptococci (four), P. aeruginosa (two), obligate anaerobes (two), Streptococcus pyogenes (one), and Aeromonas species (one). A cure or satisfactory response was achieved in 12 of the 13 (92 percent) patients who received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and in 10 of the 12 (83 percent) patients who received moxalactam. One patient with septic arthritis who received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had a relapse during therapy, as did one moxalactam-treated patient with a post-surgical wound infection. The other patient in whom moxalactam treatment failed had a wound infection that became reinfected. Some abnormalities in laboratory parameters occurred in each group, but none was severe enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  - Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. We studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection. A dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. Twenty-nine organisms were isolated from 26 patients. Infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. Bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of symptoms. All of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the population studied.
TI  - Are the tonsils and adenoids a reservoir of infection in otitis media with effusion (glue ear)?
AB  - In a prospective investigation of the treatment of glue ear in children, the possible role of persistent infection in the tonsils and adenoids was assessed by comparing bacterial cultures of swabs and resected tissue from the tonsils and adenoids of patients with cultures of swabs from similar sites in control subjects without ENT abnormality. For almost all potential pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between patients and controls. The same was true of Streptococcus pyogenes in tonsil specimens, while in adenoid specimens rather more isolates were obtained in patients than controls. This difference was just statistically significant at the 5% level, but only when all isolations, including very scanty growths, were compared. On present evidence, persistent infection should not be invoked to explain the success of adenoidectomy in otitis media with effusion or to justify adenotonsillectomy.
TI  - Attachment of staphylococci and streptococci on fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, and fibrinogen bound to a solid phase.
AB  - The attachment of Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) and two strains of group A and  G streptococci on glass cover slips coated with fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, or fibrinogen was studied. The attachment was quantitated by counting the attached bacteria on glass surfaces coated with a similar molarity of the proteins. Fibronectin was a more effective attachment factor than fibrinogen for staphylococci, while group G streptococci attached better on fibrinogen- than on fibronectin-coated cover slips. In this system, group A streptococci bound almost exclusively to substrate-bound fibrinogen. Attachment experiments involving the use of staphylococci pretreated with soluble fibronectin or fibrinogen revealed that bacterium-bound fibronectin and fibrinogen were able to enhance the adherence on cover slips coated with fibronectin. The 30-kilodalton NH2-terminal and the 120- to 140-kilodalton COOH-terminal fragments of fibronectin, both of which contain bacterial binding sites, mediated the staphylococcal attachment, suggesting that both parts of the molecule are involved in the attachment mediated by fibronectin.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of S 6472 (sustained release preparation of cefaclor) in the pediatric field].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on S 6472 were carried out and following results were obtained. Serum concentrations after single oral administration showed 2 peaks at 1 or 2 hours and 5 or 6 hours in the cases with normal meal. Namely this drug has much more maintenance of serum concentration than normal cefaclor. In maintenance of serum concentrations after the administration, there were no obviously difference between normal and heavy meal. S 6472 was administered twice a day to 7 patients with various infections (bronchopneumonia 2 cases, acute bronchitis 1 case, purulent tonsillitis 4 cases) and clinical responses were all effective results. Pathogenic bacteria of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and H. influenzae were completely eliminated in all cases. No significant side effects were observed. On the above results, this administration method of S 6472 twice a day was considered to be good response against mild or moderate bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of lidocaine on bacteria isolated from dermal lesions.
AB  - We studied the antibacterial properties of lidocaine and lidocaine with methylparaben, employing bacteria that were isolated from dermal lesions. Our study was significant because local anesthetics utilized before obtaining material for biopsy and/or culture may result in false-negative results. Killing curves were calculated to ascertain exposure times of bacteria to various concentrations of lidocaine with and without methylparaben that could affect recovery of viable bacteria from clinical specimens. The bacteria studied varied greatly in their susceptibility to lidocaine, with Neisseria species being the most sensitive. Greater inhibitory activity was noted against bacteria when methylparaben was present. Our study suggests that lower concentrations of lidocaine without methylparaben should be employed.
TI  - Survival of herpes simplex virus and other selected microorganisms on patient charts: potential source of infection.
AB  - This study indicated that when inoculated onto dental charts, both viruses and bacteria were capable of survival allowing the potential for transmission of infection within the dental office. The conscientious dental practitioner can take steps to reduce this possible mode of infection by removing contaminated surgical gloves or washing hands before handling the chart. An additional method of reducing this potential would be to wipe the chart with an antiseptic solution. Although this study has shown that there is a potential for the spread of infection with the organisms tested, the actual extent of dental chart contamination and resultant illnesses contracted are the basis for further study. Additional studies are needed to follow the pattern of chart distribution from person to person within the dental office, determine the types and quantities of pathogens present in the mouth that would contaminate the charts, and sample the charts under actual clinical conditions to determine the types and viability of the organisms present.
TI  - Streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein (HPr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-ser-HPr) in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (J. Deutscher and M. H. Saier, Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:6790-6794, 1983). Here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of Streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr. The enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 X 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a Sephacryl S-200 column. On native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 X 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(4). Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the ATP-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of HPr, had no effect on the phosphatase activity. Other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. However, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the ATP-dependent HPr kinase, stimulated the P-ser-HPr phosphatase. EDTA at a concentration of 0.1 mM completely inhibited the phosphatase. Divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ overcame the inhibition by EDTA. Fe2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ had no effect, whereas Ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. ATP was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. Under conditions in which ATP severely inhibited the phosphatase, ADP was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. Besides P-ser-HPr of S. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus casei. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the S. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold decreased in the presence of P-ser-HPr of S. aureus, as compared with HPr. However, when P-ser-HPr was first incubated with P-ser-HPr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as HPr. Besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in P-ser-HPr.
TI  - The bacteriology of burns.

TI  - Presence of laminin receptors in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A characteristic feature of infection by Staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. The ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. Extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. Similar laminin receptors were found in Staphylococcus aureus but not in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. There were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. The molecular weight of the receptor was 50,000 and pI was 4.2. Eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means of the binding of S. aureus in the presence of laminin. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion.
TI  - Bacteriological features and chemotherapy of adult acute purulent otitis media.
AB  - Eighty-eight patients from 16 to 79 years old, with acute purulent otitis media,  were bacteriologically examined at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of a primary care hospital in Tokyo from July 1979 to May 1983. Fifty-six patients underwent paracentesis, and 32 patients exhibited otorrhea due to previous spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane. Bacteriologic cultures revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (62.5 per cent), including S. pneumoniae Type III (28.1 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae (10.5 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (11.5 per cent), and Streptococcus pyogenes (7.3 per cent). S. pneumoniae Type III had a notably high detection rate in patients from 50 to 79 years old (50-75 per cent). Because Haemophilus influenzae was detected at a relatively high rate in patients of all ages, if can be considered as a major causative pathogen of AOM. In 44 patients, selected mainly from those who underwent paracentesis, a comparative study of bacteria found in middle ear fluid and naso-pharyngeal mucus revealed the same bacteria in 43 out of 44 cases (97.7 per cent), indicating the presence of bacterial infection through the auditory canal. Antibiotics were selected according to an Expected Efficacy Index (EEI), the antibiotic of first choice being Ampicillin or Cefaclor.
TI  - Extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen) bind and aggregate bacteria.
AB  - The normal microbial colonization of sites in the body's tissues by certain bacteria requires that the bacteria first bind to extracellular secreted constituents, cell-surface membranes, or cell matrixes. This study examines two interactions of a variety of bacteria with the cell matrix noncollagenous proteins fibronectin and laminin and with basement membrane (Type IV) collagen. Adherence of bacteria to matrix proteins coated on tissue culture wells was examined with the use of radiolabeled bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus sanguis bound well to fibronectin, laminin, and Type IV collagen, whereas a variety of gram-negative organisms did not bind. The interaction of soluble laminin, fibronectin, and Type IV collagen with bacteria was monitored by nephelometry with the use of a platelet aggregometer. S. aureus aggregated in response to fibronectin, laminin, or Type IV collagen. In contrast, gram-negative organisms did not aggregate with these proteins. It appears that fibronectin, laminin, and Type IV collagen can bind and aggregate certain gram-positive bacteria, and this binding is dependent on the surface characteristics of the organism. These adhesion molecules may play a role in the normal colonization of sites by microorganisms and in invasion during infections.
TI  - Evolution and epidemiology of MLS resistance.
AB  - Within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (MLS). This paper is limited to a description of the evolution of different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. Only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. Three groups will therefore be studied in turn: Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis. There is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of MLSB resistance observed in Clostridium perfringens and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies on the localization of peptidoglycan peptide subunit pentapeptides in bacterial cell walls.
AB  - The peptide subunit pentapeptide H-L-Ala-D-Glu(L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)-NH2 of peptidoglycan was localized in the cell walls of several Gram-positive bacteria employing the indirect immunoferritin technique. Specific antibodies to the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety of non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptide were raised in rabbits by immunization with synthetic immunogen albumin-(CH2CO-Gly-L-Ala-L-Ala-D-Ala-D-Ala-OH)39. Specificity of these antibodies for the peptide subunit pentapeptide and not for the peptide subunit tetrapeptide was corroborated in a Farr-type radio-active hapten binding assay. Specificity of labelling with ferritin was established by immunoelectron microscopic controls, and by the excellent correlation between specific labelling of cells with ferritin and the particular peptidoglycan primary structure of bacterial strains investigated. Cells of Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus revealing non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptides in their peptidoglycans could specifically be labelled. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis, on the contrary, missing such pentapeptides, failed in labelling. The implication of this method to possibly localize the points of attack of penicillin or cycloserine is discussed.
TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of imipenem/cilastatin and cefotaxime for treatment of lung, soft tissue, and renal infections.
AB  - Thirty-one moderately or severely ill hospitalized patients with proved (25 patients) or suspected (six) bacterial infections were randomly allocated to receive imipenem/cilastatin (16) or cefotaxime (15). The median age, sex, duration of therapy, underlying disease, and types of infection were similar in both groups. Nineteen patients with pneumonia, eight with soft tissue infection, and four with acute pyelonephritis were included. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli (six), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Streptococcus pyogenes (five), Haemophilus species (four), Proteus species (three), Staphylococcus aureus (three), and Serratia marcescens (two). In the imipenem/cilastatin group, 13 patients were cured of their infections and three showed improvement. In the cefotaxime group, nine were cured, three showed improvement, and three showed no improvement. Nine patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin developed phlebitis, as compared with eight treated with cefotaxime. One patient treated with cefotaxime developed diarrhea. During therapy, potential pathogens were isolated from four patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group (Candida species [two] and Pseudomonas maltophilia [two]), as compared with eight in the cefotaxime group (enterococci [two], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [two], Candida species [two], Acinetobacter anitratus [one], and Pseudomonas fluorescens [one]). There were no recognized superinfections.
TI  - Localized Darier's disease of the scalp complicated by Trichophyton tonsurans infection.
AB  - A unique form of localized keratosis follicularis (Darier's disease) of the scalp occurred in a mother and daughter. The presence of secondary bacterial and fungal infection was responsible for a delay in establishing an accurate diagnosis of the true nature of their disorder.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  - The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was studied in 127 patients with roentgenologically verified pneumonia who needed hospitalization. Etiology was determined on the basis of a positive blood culture and/or a significant antibody titer increase. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the probable etiological agent in 69 patients, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in five patients, Streptococcus pyogenes in two patients, and Legionella pneumophila and Staphylococcus aureus in one patient each. Evidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in 18 patients and of Chlamydia psittaci infection in three patients. Influenza virus type A was the cause of infection in 15 patients. One patient had infection with influenza virus type B, one patient with parainfluenza virus type 1, and three patients with respiratory syncytial virus. In 20 patients there was evidence of infection with more than one microorganism. No etiological agent was found in 27 patients. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant etiological agent penicillin should be drug of first choice in patients with pneumonia who need treatment in hospital. In young adults, however, the high frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection would justify the use of erythromycin or doxycycline as drug of first choice.
TI  - [HR 810 (cefpirome). Experimental evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo antibiotic activity of a new amino-2-thiazole methoxy- imino cephalosporin].
AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.
TI  - The aerobic bacteriology of infected skin lesions in children of the Eastern Highlands Province.
AB  - Of 480 children studied, the relative frequency of skin infections divided into three categories were: score 266 (55%), infected scabies 164 (34%) and tropical ulcers 50 (10%). Infected scabies was more prevalent in the less than 2 year age group and tropical ulcers were commonest in the 9-12 year age group and these differences were significant. The majority of lesions occurred on the lower extremities with the trunk the least commonly affected area. No significant differences were found in different age groups between males and females. Beta haemolytic streptococci (95%), Staphylococcus aureus (83%), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (72%) and Corynebacterium haemolyticum (35%) were the major bacteria isolated. Beta haemolytic streptococci were the most prevalent in infected scabies and least in tropical ulcers and these differences were significant. Three major Lancefield groups were isolated: group A (61%), group C (19%) and group G (19%). The distribution of these groups were unequal with group A most common in infected scabies but rarely seen in tropical ulcers. Groups C and G were found more commonly in tropical ulcers than the other two groups of lesions and these differences were significant. Multiple populations of beta haemolytic streptococci in a single lesion were seen in 19% of children. Less than one third of Streptococcus pyogenes were M typable and of these 18% were known nephritogenic serotypes. Staphylococcus aureus was significantly more common in infected scabies and least common in tropical ulcers. The prevalence of Vincent's organisms in tropical ulcers (74%) was significantly higher than scores (9%) and infected scabies (1%). The isolation rate of Corynebacterium diphtheriae was significantly higher in infected scabies than the other two groups. The most common biotype isolated was var mitis (72%). Only 2% of isolates were toxigenic. Corynebacterium haemolyticum was isolated significantly more frequently in tropical ulcers than the other lesions. All major bacteria, excluding betalactamase-producing Straphylococcus aureus, were uniformly sensitive to penicillin. Methicillin resistance was found in 1% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and is reported here for the first time in this country. These isolates were also multiply resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
TI  - Suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: mediation by Pseudomonas-activated suppressor monocytes.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to suppress cell-mediated immunity in experimental animals, but recent reports have also demonstrated that there is a strong T-cell response to this bacteria. Our studies of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a great variation in the in vitro proliferative response to killed P. aeruginosa, so we examined the interaction of the different mononuclear cells in cultures with this bacteria. P. aeruginosa stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes, specifically the surface-immunoglobulin-negative, T8- subset, which are felt to be T helper cells. P. aeruginosa added in coculture experiments to peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or tetanus toxoid suppressed the proliferation to these latter antigens. This proliferation was not affected by the depletion of adherent monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the suppression was restored when monocytes were added back to these cultures. Moreover, monocytes pulsed with P. aeruginosa but not with S. aureus suppressed the antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This monocyte suppression was not inhibited by indomethacin and was unlikely to be the result of prostaglandin synthesis by these cells. Thus, P. aeruginosa can induce monocytes to suppress antigen-stimulated T-lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, and these suppressor cells may facilitate the growth of this organism in disorders such as cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.

TI  - Deposition of C3b and iC3b onto particulate activators of the human complement system. Quantitation with monoclonal antibodies to human C3.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of C3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (C) system by human serum. Sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with IgM (EIgM) and IgG (EIgG) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (CP). Yeast (Y), rabbit erythrocytes (ER), and five species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (AP). The deposition of C3b onto EIgM and EIgG incubated in C7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. At all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of C3b to iC3b. Kinetic analysis of C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. The deposition of C3 onto the AP activators ER and Y was also dependent on serum concentration, and ER, but not Y, required the presence of Mg-EGTA and thus the activation of only the AP. C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b on Y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound C3 converted to iC3b. For ER, maximum C3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of Mg-EGTA. However, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound C2 was iC3b in the absence of Mg-EGTA, compared with only 52% in the presence of Mg-EGTA. Thus, even on AP activators, a large portion of C3b may be converted to iC3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the particle's surface. Studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. Approximately 3-5 X 10(4) molecules of C3 were bound per microorganism, with opsonization being completed in 30 min. Remarkably, only 16-28% of bound C3 was in the form of iC3b, even after 2 h of incubation. The presence or absence of Mg-EGTA, or the addition of purified CR1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of C3b to iC3b. Finally, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of particle-bound 125I-C3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of iC3b to C3d,g or C3d. The data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of C3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be C3b.
TI  - The value of bacteriology and serology in the diagnosis of cellulitis and erysipelas.
AB  - Patients diagnosed as suffering from erysipelas or cellulitis were subjected to bacteriological and serological investigations. The serological tests used included the anti-streptolysin O reaction (ASO), the anti-deoxyribonuclease B test (ADB) and the anti-hyaluronidase tests (AHT) that are specific both for the group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) and for the human pyogenic streptococci of group C or group G. Antibody tests to the alpha-lysin and the nuclease of Staphylococcus aureus were also employed. Conventional bacteriological culture methods were used plus needle aspiration of injected saline in most patients with erysipelas, but recognized pathogens were isolated in only 42% of cases. Our results indicate the limitations of these tests for making initial diagnoses and deciding treatment. Serial serological testing was very successful in differentiating cellulitis due to group A, C or G haemolytic streptococci, or occasionally Staphylococcus aureus, but was positive in only 40% of cases of erysipelas.
TI  - Clinical value of paired sputum and transtracheal aspirates in the initial management of pneumonia.
AB  - One hundred young adults with acute pneumonia were prospectively studied to determine the impact of the transtracheal aspiration (TTA) Gram stain on immediate management. Sputum and TTA interpretations by staff and housestaff were compared. After a management plan was elected based on sputum Gram stain interpretation, the TTA was evaluated and the final plan chosen. A change in treatment after the TTA was available occurred in eight cases, and this was an appropriate change in only five. The putative pathogen as identified by TTA culture was correctly predicted after sputum Gram stain interpretation in 36 to 62 percent of cases and after TTA interpretation in 37 to 62 percent. This indicates significant observer variation but not superiority of one type of specimen over the other. In most cases, paired sputum and TTA Gram stain were both read correctly or incorrectly. When differences occurred, sputum interpretations were as likely to be correct as were TTA interpretations. The TTA Gram stain offered no advantage over sputum Gram stain in the initial management of acute pneumonia in this young adult military population.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Osteomyelitis of the ischiopubic synchondrosis.
AB  - Infection of the ischiopubic synchondrosis (IPS) is a diagnostic dilemma. This article reviews four such cases. All patients complained of ipsilateral groin pain, were febrile, and had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Initial radiographs were interpreted as normal but later showed increasingly lucent zones at the IPS. Radionuclide bone scans demonstrated diffusely increased uptake in the vicinity of the IPS. This contrasts with the discrete pattern seen with a normal IPS. Blood cultures were positive. Satisfactory outcomes were obtained with conservative treatment. Clinical presentation, laboratory results, radiographs, and bone scans must be correlated to distinguish this syndrome from a "normal radiologic variant".
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria measured by flow cytometry.
AB  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria were studied by a flow cytometric method. The percentage of phagocytosing leukocytes was similar for all bacterial strains examined, but Salmonella typhi and Neisseria meningitidis were more slowly phagocytosed than other bacteria. The phagosomal pH surrounding the different bacterial species 15 min after the start of phagocytosis were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 4.4; N. meningitidis 4.9; Str. pyogenes 5.1; Staphylococcus aureus 5.2; Escherichia coli 5.3; S. typhi 5.4; and Klebsiella pneumoniae 5.7. For longer incubation periods, the phagosomal pH remained nearly constant. Staph. aureus, E. coli and S. typhi were the most readily degraded of the species tested. The proteins of all bacteria were degraded more rapidly than their DNA as determined by measurements of the loss of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-fluorescence and ethidium bromide-fluorescence, respectively. The rate of degradation varied from one bacterial species to another. The degradation of proteins and DNA was maximal for bacteria residing in a phagosomal environment estimated to be between pH 5.2 and 5.4.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics eliminated by first order kinetics.
AB  - We wanted to simulate the conditions within the body where bacteria are exposed to antibiotics at concentrations which diminish exponentially and thus do not remain constant as in the usual test systems for determination of the minimum inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations (MIC, MBC). For this purpose we employed a model with a glass chamber containing a constant volume of culture which was supplied continuously with medium at a constant rate. We studied the pattern of bacterial response using a series of bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents added to the system at various multiples of the MIC of several bacterial strains, and using different rates of elimination of the antibacterial agent. Strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, flucloxacillin, gentamicin, or oxytetracyclin. The bacteria were killed or maintained at their initial density depending on the antibiotic and its concentration. The main findings were: for most drugs drop in bacterial number persisted while the concentration of the chamber remained above MIC, a period of time elapsed before recovery and bacterial multiplication resumed at the same rate as in control cultures, the period of antibacterial postantibiotic effect lasted longer with Gram-positive than with Gram-negative species, the point in time when the bacteria resumed multiplication corresponded to the IC50. We observed only minor differences in the pattern of bacteria during exposure to potentially bactericidal agents compared to antibiotics with mainly bacteriostatic effects.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Interaction of gram-positive microorganisms with complement.
AB  
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on adherence of microorganisms to epithelial cell surfaces.
AB  - Microbial adherence to epithelial cell surfaces has been implicated as the first  step in the initiation of several infectious diseases. Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics affect the adherence properties of microorganisms in various ways. They can inhibit the expression of fimbriae and the synthesis of other surface components, and they may also cause the release of constituents from the cell. The ability of antibiotics to affect the properties of microbial adherence to cell surfaces may be an important criterion in selecting an antibiotic for therapy.
TI  - [Ultrastructural characteristics of stable L forms of some bacterial species].
AB  
TI  - Uptake of iron from hemoglobin and the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex by hemolytic bacteria.
AB  - The abilities of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to remove iron  from mouse 59Fe hemoglobin that was either in free form or complexed with human haptoglobin, were evaluated. 59Fe hemoglobin from the amphibian Taricha granulosa was also used in free form or complexed with the amphibian's hemoglobin-binding proteins. Contrary to what was reported from a study using pathogenic Escherichia coli, haptoglobin failed to exhibit a bacteriostatic influence when complexed with hemoglobin. In our study, more 59Fe was removed by the bacteria from the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex than from free mouse hemoglobin. The hemoglobin and hemoglobin-plasma protein complexes of Taricha were stripped of 59Fe at similar rates and extents by both bacterial species.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Practical use of surveillance for prevention of nosocomial infection.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - Bordetella adenylate cyclase: host toxicity and diagnostic utility.
AB  - Two toxins from Bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and Bordetella adenylate cyclase, cause profound disruptions of cAMP metabolism in mammalian cells. While the role of each toxin in the whooping cough syndrome is unknown, it is highly likely that together they confer on the organism an important proliferative advantage. Intact B. pertussis cells express large amounts of adenylate cyclase activity on their exterior surface. In a presently unknown fashion, this enzyme can enter human phagocytes, elevate cellular cAMP and impair host defense. We reasoned that this unusual enzyme might serve to signal the presence of B. pertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected persons. Here we report a series of in vitro experiments which confirm the feasibility of such an approach. We find that calcium alginate swabs containing as few as 100 B. pertussis organisms produce readily detectable amounts of cAMP in our assay. Nasopharyngeal secretions swabbed from healthy volunteers, however produced no detectable cAMP alone and did not affect the production of cAMP by B. pertussis. We have also tested pure cultures of four common bacterial pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli) which may be co-isolated in clinical whooping cough and find that none interferes with the detection of B. pertussis. We conclude that the unique adenylate cyclase of B. pertussis might be a valuable diagnostic device.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms isolated as part of a multiclinic study. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (MIC90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90S were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. The MIC90 of cefmenoxime for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC50 = 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Human mononuclear leukocyte transglutaminase activity is enhanced by streptococcal erythrogenic toxin and a staphylococcal mitogenic factor associated with toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - Transglutaminase activity in human peripheral lymphocytes is enhanced after incubation of the cells with concanavalin A. Streptococcal proliferative factor toxin (erythrogenic toxin) from Streptococcus pyogenes and Toxic shock syndrome toxin from Staphylococcus aureus were purified and tested for their ability to enhance transglutaminase activity. Mononuclear leukocyte transglutaminase activity was enhanced 3-5-fold 30 min after incubation with either toxin. Enhancement occurred only when toxin was incubated with intact cells; addition of toxin to cell lysates was without effect. Transglutaminase was not measurable extracellularly. Histamine and dansyl cadaverine, competitive substrates for transglutaminase, inhibited [3H]putrescine incorporation into casein and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Incubation of lymphocytes with cycloheximide and either toxin or concanavalin A did not inhibit enzyme activity. These bacterial toxins, like phytomitogens, may perturb the cellular membrane and mediate their effect by transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking of membrane proteins.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Extracellular stimulation by serum proteins required for maximal intracellular killing of microorganisms by mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Intracellular killing of catalase-positive Staphylococcus aureus by resident mouse peritoneal macrophages was very low in the absence of serum but maximal in the presence of fresh normal serum. A large proportion of catalase-negative Streptococcus pyogenes were killed in the absence of extracellular serum, and maximal killing was reached only when serum was present extracellularly. Further investigations revealed that stimulation of intracellular killing by extracellular serum is dependent on the interaction of immunoglobulin G and Fc receptors and of complement component C3b with C3b receptors in the macrophage membrane.
TI  - Enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against gram-positive aerobic organisms grown in the presence of lincomycin.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubating Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Streptococcus pyogenes with subinhibitory concentrations of lincomycin was studied with respect to polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms. Culturing the above organisms in the presence of lincomycin (1/4 MIC) resulted in a significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.
TI  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as a guideline in the management of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Thirty-eight children who had recurrent tonsillitis and who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures, obtained prior to therapy and two weeks after the termination of therapy, were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9.3 isolates (5.2 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after the completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.5 isolates (3.0 aerobes and 2.5 anaerobes). The GABHS were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy, and the numbers of isolates of Bacteroides spp and Staphylococcus aureus were reduced. Beta-lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 57 isolates recovered from all tonsillar surfaces. This group included all isolates of S. aureus (15) and Bacteroides fragilis (eight), 19 of 34 Bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates (56 per cent), and seven of 12 Bacteroides oralis isolates (58 per cent). Only four isolates of beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains were recovered after the conclusion of therapy. Follow-up study of 33 children for eight to 16 months (average, 13 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 31.

AB  
TI  - Quantitative measurement of beta lactamase in tonsils of children with recurrent  tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. The  tonsils' core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Beta lactamase production was assayed in all isolates and beta lactamase activity was measured in the contents of each tonsil. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.9 isolates (4.4 anaerobes and 3.5 aerobes) per specimen. Beta lactamase production was noted in 58 isolates recovered from 39 tonsils (78%). These were all 21 isolates of S. aureus and 10 B. fragilis, 18 of 45 B. melaninogenicus (40%), 7 of 14 B. oralis (50%), and 2 of 13 H. influenzae type B (15%). Beta lactamase activity was detected in 33 of the 39 (85%) tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing bacteria, and in none of the 11 tonsils which had no beta lactamase-producing bacteria. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of detectable beta lactamase activity in the tonsillar tissue in most of the tonsils which harbored beta lactamase-producing organism.
TI  - Effect of mouse passage on Fc receptor expression by group A streptococci.
AB  - The expression and stability of receptors for the Fc region of human IgG on the surface of group A streptococci was studied. Two strains were sequentially passed in mice 22 times. The Fc-receptor expression on one group A strain, 529, was unaltered while the expression of Fc receptor on a second, 64, was enhanced and approached the level of Fc-receptor expression of the protein A-rich Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain. The level of Fc-receptor expression on this organism remained stable for over 18 months of laboratory subculture. Mouse passage did not result in the production of a soluble Fc receptor from either of the streptococcal strains. Heat extraction of the Fc-receptor-positive group A strain resulted in solubilization of an Fc-receptor activity which was functionally distinct from either staphylococcal protein A or the Fc receptor isolated from a group C streptococcus.
TI  - Characteristics and functional capacities of human cord blood granulocytes and monocytes.
AB  - Cord blood phagocytic cells were characterized with respect to cytochemical activities, Fc gamma and C3b receptors, and capacity to phagocytose and kill various species of bacteria. The percentages of peroxidase-positive granulocytes and monocytes from neonates and adults were comparable; the percentage of esterase-positive cord-blood monocytes was about two-thirds of that of adults' blood monocytes. The numbers of cord blood and adults' monocytes with Fc gamma and C3b receptors were similar. Phagocytic and intracellular killing capacities of cord blood granulocytes and monocytes were investigated for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B Streptococcus type III. The rates of phagocytosis and intracellular killing by granulocytes from newborns proved to be comparable to the corresponding values for granulocytes from adults. Cord blood monocytes phagocytosed E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes at a normal rate, and killed ingested E. coli and S. pyogenes intracellularly at the same rate as adults' monocytes did. However, S. aureus was killed at a much lower rate by cord blood monocytes than by monocytes from adults. Phagocytic activity for group B Streptococcus was impaired and killing of these bacteria by cord blood monocytes was virtually nil. The latter finding might partially explain the frequent streptococcal infections in newborns.
TI  - A new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  - Several tests, bacitracin, CAMP, pyroglutamic acid-B-naphthylamide test (PYR test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. Bacitracin correctly identified all of the group A streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group A. The PYR reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group A streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. The PYR reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Both the salt tolerance test and the PYR reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group D streptococci as non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Pigment production by group B streptococci was more reliable than the CAMP test for identifying group B streptococci. The combination of PYR, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.
TI  - Properties of ATP-dependent protein kinase from Streptococcus pyogenes that phosphorylates a seryl residue in HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Transport of sugars across the cytoplasmic membranes of gram-positive bacteria appears to be regulated by the action of a metabolite-activated, ATP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a seryl residue in the phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system, HPr. We have developed a quantitative assay for measuring the activity of this enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes. The product of the in vitro protein kinase-catalyzed reaction was shown to be phosphoseryl-HPr by several independent criteria (rates of hydrolysis in the presence of various agents, detection of serine-phosphate in acid hydrolysates, immunological assay, and electrophoretic migration rates). HPrs isolated from four different gram-positive bacteria (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) were shown to be phosphorylated by the kinase from S. pyogenes. In contrast, Escherichia coli HPr was not a substrate of this enzyme. The soluble kinase released from the particulate fraction of the cells with high salt in the presence of a protease inhibitor was shown to have an approximate molecular weight of 60,000 as estimated by gel filtration. Its activity was dependent on divalent cations, with Mg2+ and Mn2+ being most active. EDTA, Pi, and high concentrations of salt were strongly inhibitory. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7.0, exhibited high affinity for its substrates, and was dependent on the presence of one of several metabolites. Of these compounds, fructose 1-6-diphosphate was most active, with gluconate 6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate exhibiting moderate to low stimulatory activities. Other compounds tested, including a variety of sugar phosphates, pyridine nucleotides, and other metabolites were without effect. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr on the seryl residue was strongly inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of the active histidyl residue of this protein. Treatment of the kinase with diethyl pyrocarbonate strongly inhibited the ATP-dependent phosphorylation activity, although the sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and iodoacetate were without effect. These results serve to characterize the HPr (serine) kinase, which apparently regulates the rates of carbohydrate transport in streptococcal cells via the phosphotransferase system. A primary role of this kinase in the control of cellular inducer levels and carbohydrate metabolic rates is proposed.
TI  - Wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  - The antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and Enterobacter spp. All of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with MICs ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3H]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, DNA was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. This suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial DNA.
TI  - Empedopeptin (BMY-28117), a new depsipeptide antibiotic. I. Production, isolation and properties.
AB  - Empedopeptin is a new antibiotic produced by empedobacter haloabium nov. sp. (ATCC 31962). It is a water-soluble depsipeptide antibiotic containing eight amino acid residues and a C14-fatty acid moiety in the molecule. Although structurally unrelated, empedopeptin and vancomycin have similar antimicrobial spectra against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria including antibiotic-resistant strains. Empedopeptin is highly active in vivo in mice against systemic infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Empedopeptin is not absorbed orally.
TI  - Pyomyositis. Report of 18 cases in Hawaii.
AB  - Eighteen patients with pyomyositis were seen at a large hospital in Hawaii. Most  were healthy young men or boys, and eight had never traveled abroad. Fever, muscle pain and swelling, and leukocytosis were common, but only seven had erythema or fluctuance. A single large muscle was infected in 14, and two to three muscles were infected in the others. Pyomyositis mimicked cellulitis, muscle hematoma, thrombophlebitis, appendicitis, and neoplasm. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 13, and Streptococcus pyogenes was found in two. Bacteremia occurred in 29% (5/17). Drainage and antimicrobial agents were usually effective therapy, but one patient died and another had CNS damage. The pathogenesis is uncertain, but 12 had nonpenetrating muscle injury and 13 had pyoderma, suggesting that bacteria invade injured muscle via the bloodstream or lymphatic system.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of streptococcal tonsillar infection.
AB  - The failure of penicillin to eradicate group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is a growing problem. This review summarizes current data concerning the role of aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of tonsillar infection caused by GABHS. Clinical studies have demonstrated the recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and detectable levels of the enzyme beta-lactamase in cultures of core tonsillar specimens in greater than 80% of the patients. The predominant bacteria have been Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides ruminicola, and Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms have emerged in about one-third of patients after one course of penicillin therapy and can be transferred to patient's household contacts. These organisms were present in tonsillar cultures in higher numbers in children with acute tonsillitis who did not respond to penicillin therapy than in those who were cured. Protection of GABHS by beta-lactamase-producing organisms has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Several studies, including a recent double-blinded study, have demonstrated the ability of clindamycin to eradicate the streptococcal carrier state and to prevent recurrent infection in selected patients.
TI  - A comparison of the in-vitro antibacterial and complement activating effect of 'OpSite' and 'Tegaderm' dressings.
AB  - Two readily available semipermeable polyurethane dressings, 'OpSite' and 'Tegaderm', were tested for their in vitro ability to kill potential bacterial pathogens and activate complement C3. In bacterial killing tests, 'OpSite' was superior to 'Tegaderm' and in addition only 'OpSite' activated C3. It is concluded that in the practical situation, 'OpSite' could well confer a greater margin of safety.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Group A streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide inhibits phagocytic activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Injection of sterile aqueous preparations of the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide of  group A streptococci (PG-APS) produces chronic inflammation in several animal models. Chronic bacterial infection may be involved in some aspects of the pathogenesis of inflammation associated with the accumulation of PG-APS. Accordingly, the effect of PG-APS on human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN]) bactericidal activity was studied with the supposition that this interaction may contribute to the inflammation observed. Concentrations of PG-APS greater than 10 micrograms/ml inhibited the ability of PMNs to kill Staphylococcus aureus. This inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of PG-APS on PMNs, nor did PG-APS inhibit PMN metabolism required for the formation of microbicidal oxygen reduction products. PG-APS concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml or greater in the presence of 10% normal serum inhibited the attachment of bacteria to PMNs by 49% as compared with control cell populations. The concentrations of PG-APS required to inhibit uptake of Staphylococcus aureus were identical to those required for inhibition of PMN bactericidal activity. This inhibition did not occur in the presence of serum-free medium or medium with sera that had been heated to inactivate complement. These results show that PG-APS interacts with serum to inhibit PMN-mediated killing of S. aureus, most probably by interfering with bacterial uptake.
TI  - [Bactericidal activity of octophene].
AB  - In this study the bactericidal activity of Clofoctol has been evaluated by "in vitro" technique against gram-positive against gram-positive microorganisms clinically isolated. The results show that MIC of Clofoctol is very close to its bactericidal activity, which could therefore be retained as its main activity. The MBC recovered was 1-8 mcg/ml against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 2-8 mcg/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes, while the bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, evaluated at M.B.C., was recovered after 30'.
TI  - Effect of bacteria on healing of superficial wounds.

TI  - A profile of skin sepsis in meat handlers.
AB  - Four hundred and sixty-seven episodes of sepsis associated with meat handling and poultry processing occupations were seen in two Health Districts of North Yorkshire in a period of just over five years. Altogether 389 patients were infected in 16 outbreaks and 24 sporadic incidents; spread of infection was noted in families of nine workers. The variety of skin infections included septic cuts and scratches, paronychia, abscess, lymphangitis as well as infection in pierced ear lobes and in tattoos. Beta-haemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus were present in 96 per cent of the 303 episodes that yielded positive cultures. These included 203 episodes with Streptococcus pyogenes and 170 with S. aureus. Skin sepsis appears to be common among meat handlers in this part of England.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of HR810, a new wide-spectrum aminothiazolyl alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin.
AB  - HR810 (Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc., Somerville, N.J.) is a new, cyclical-pyridinium cephalosporin that appeared superior to numerous comparison drugs against 658 strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. Seventeen Enterobacteriaceae spp. were tested by broth microdilution methods, and the 50% MICs (MIC50S) and 90% MICs (MIC90s) were 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Only one strain had an MIC greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml (99.6% is considered susceptible). HR810 inhibited 98% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. was 4.0 micrograms/ml. It was also very active against Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) but marginally active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) and enterococcus (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml). Non-enterococcal streptococci had MIC50s ranging from 0.008 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes to 0.12 micrograms/ml for pneumococci. All MICs of HR810 against Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. were less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml (MIC50, 0.002 to 0.008 micrograms/ml). HR810 poorly inhibited beta-lactamases and was very stable against 11 tested beta-lactamases of plasmid (TEM, OXA, SHV-1, and PSE) and chromosomal (K1, K14, P99) types.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1983].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 3,286 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1983 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MIC less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 75, 93, 70 and 96% of the strains tested, while those to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX for 89, 65, 61, 86 and 62%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 60%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ accounted for 95, 95, 80 and 90%, respectively, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml for 79%. S. pneumoniae: At MICs less than 3 micrograms/ml, all strains were susceptible to all cephem antibiotics tested. S. faecalis: Only a very few strains were susceptible to these antibiotics. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus spp.: Susceptible strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 80 and 81% of the strains tested, while those of indole negative and positive Proteus for 69 and 4%, respectively. Strains of E. coli susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml were 78 to 96%, while those to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX and LMOX were 94 to 100%. Those of K. pneumoniae to these 2 groups of antibiotics were 81 to 95% and 94 to 100%, respectively. Susceptible strains of indole negative Proteus to the former group were 81 to 93% and those to the latter were 100%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical and morphological recovery between two episodes of acute glomerulonephritis: a light and electron microscopic study with immunofluorescence.
AB  - A 4 year-old girl presented with 2 episodes of acute glomerulonephritis with clinical and morphological recovery between them. Both episodes were preceded by impetigo. The first and third renal biopsies showed glomerulitis with diffuse dense deposits in the mesangium, segmentary intramembranous dense deposits, atypical "humps" and granular C3. The second biopsy, taken between episodes, was considered to be normal. Two years and 5 months after the second episode the clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were normal.
TI  - Primary acute haematogenous osteomyelitis of an isolated metatarsal in children.
AB  - Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis of an isolated metatarsal is a rare condition in childhood. Fourteen children diagnosed with this condition were followed up for an average of 3 years. Organisms responsible were found to be either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Growth disturbances of the metatarsal were seen in the majority, but the radiographic features were not serious in the long term, and no child was subsequently disabled. Since these children often present with symptoms akin to trauma, a better recognition of the condition is required to avoid misdiagnosis.
TI  - [Stimulation of lymphokine formation as an index of reactivity to bacterial antigens].
AB  - In the cultures of lymphocytes from healthy donors, activated by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcal antigens (allergens) the formation of lymphokines stimulating the oxygen-dependent metabolism of human neutrophils was studied. The preparations yielded positive reactions in a wide range of concentrations (2-60 micrograms/ml); in experiments with concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml these reactions were observed, respectively, in 71.5%, 40.0% and 47.7% of the donors. Individual features were most pronounced when minimally active concentrations were used, and an increase in dosage led to smoothing out differences and to an increase in lymphokine production. Direct contact with allergens did not induce the stimulation of neutrophils. The results thus obtained are discussed from the viewpoint of the functional cooperation of different effector systems of immunity.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes streptolysin O as a cause of false-positive CAMP reactions.
AB  - The synergistic hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes in the CAMP reaction by the sequential action of staphylococcal beta-lysin and the CAMP factor of group B streptococci is the only known function of this extracellular product of group B streptococci. The reaction forms the basis of the CAMP test used to identify group B streptococci because the CAMP factor is believed to be restricted to this group of organisms. However, on occasion other streptococci, notably group A streptococci, may produce a similar synergistic lysis of sheep erythrocytes. The nature of the synergistic lytic factor of group A streptococci responsible for this sequential hemolysis was investigated in a tube CAMP reaction system. The properties of this synergistic lytic factor were found to correspond to those of streptolysin O of group A streptococci. The synergistic lytic factor, like streptolysin O, was produced during the logarithmic phase of growth; the activity was increased by reducing agents and greatly decreased or abolished by heat, trypsin, cholesterol, and anti-streptolysin O, and it was immunogenic in rabbits. This would suggest that the synergistic hemolysis seen in the CAMP reaction system with group A streptococci is due to the action of those small amounts of streptolysin O which remain unoxidized and thus have a capacity to lyse the fragile beta-lysin-treated sheep erythrocytes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of moxalactam, a new 1-oxa-cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-cephamycin, moxalactam, was compared with cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefoxitin and gentamicin against 268 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus faecalis the activity of moxalactam was similar to that of the other compounds. Moxalactam was the most active antibiotic against fermentative and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moxalactam exhibited activity against gentamicin-resistant strains. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration differences were minor. Activity was not altered by changes in inoculum size, type of medium and presence of serum. The protein-binding was 35%. Moxalactam was not destroyed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. The penetrability studies demonstrated that, using E. coli UB 1005 and its mutants, the penetrability of moxalactam was higher than that of the other cephalosporins compared.
TI  - Evaluation of cefotaxime in bacterial infections.
AB  - Cefotaxime, a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated in 26 infants and children for the treatment of documented or suspected bacterial infections, including pneumonia (10 cases), soft tissue skin infection (13 cases), and urinary tract infection (3 cases). An average daily dose of 60 mg/kg in 3 to 4 divided doses was administered parenterally for an average of 7 days. In 14 of the cases, primary pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae b (resistant to ampicillin), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, were eradicated. Clinical recovery occurred in each case. Blood levels at different time intervals and biological half-life were similar to those reported for adults. Mild and transient side effects observed were elevation of SGOT in two cases, alkaline phosphatase in one, and eosinophilia in one case.
TI  - Correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  - In this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments, and IgG aggregates (dimers) was determined. The results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations were as effective as inactivated serum. A statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact IgG molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of IgG fragments and the opsonic activity was found. The combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.
TI  - Clinical laboratory and epidemiological investigations of a Streptococcus pyogenes cluster epidemic in a newborn nursery.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, nontypable with available M antisera, T type 12, and reactive in the serum opacity test, produced various lesions in 10 newborn infants during a 2-month period. All infants except one were discharged from the nursery before overt disease manifestations. Colonization studies of newborn infants showed a streptococcal carrier rate of 19% (27 of 140). Only 1 of 154 staff members yielded the same streptococcus from the throat, but it could not be implicated as the source for the outbreak. Cohorting of infants and chlorhexidine gluconate hand washing by staff members helped in terminating this cluster epidemic.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.
TI  - Effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
AB  - Two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and gentamicin. When the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the MICs of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-A streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the MIC of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. With Staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the MICs of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the MICs of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. The effect of saliva on the susceptibility of E. coli to tetracycline was also significant; MIC50 and MIC90 were reduced from 128 to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. Chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when E. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. The general significance of these observations is discussed.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Side chain modifications in lankacidin group antibiotics.
AB  - Novel N-acyl analogs of lankacidin may be prepared from 3-isocyanatolankone diformate [7,13-bis(formyloxy)-2-isocyanato-1,4,10,19-tetramethyl-16- oxabicyclo[13.2.2.]nonadeca-3,5,9,11-tetraen-17,18-dione]. Of seven such analogs evaluated in vitro only homolankacidin diformate showed significant activity. However, in a cell-free system two of the inactive analogs inhibited polypeptide synthesis as well as did lankacidin itself or erythromycin. Antibacterial activity, therefore, is a function of the ability of a congener to penetrate the bacterial cell membrane in addition to its intrinsic activity. Similarly, lankacidinol is as potent as lankacidin or erythromycin as an inhibitor of bacterial polypeptide synthesis in a cell-free system. This intrinsic activity is expressed as potent antibacterial activity against growing gram-positive cultures in O(2')-acyl derivatives with the proper lipophilicity.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - The preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. The most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, U-57,930E), in which the (2S-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2S-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. This structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. Although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Plasmodium berghei. Pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. It readily penetrates B. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses. A drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. Pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.
TI  - Fibronectin binding to a Streptococcus pyogenes strain.
AB  - In previous studies, Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to bind fibronectin (P. Kuusela, Nature (London) 276:718-720, 1978), an interaction that may be important in bacterial attachment and opsonization. Recently some strains of streptococci of serological groups A, C, and G were also found to bind fibronectin. The binding to one selected strain of Streptococcus pyogenes has been characterized here. The binding of [125I]fibronectin to streptococcal cells resembles that to staphylococcal cells and was found to be time dependent, functionally irreversible, and specific in the sense that unlabeled proteins other than fibronectin did not block binding. Bacteria incubated with proteases largely lost their ability to bind fibronectin, and material released from the streptococci by a brief trypsin digestion contained active fibronectin receptors. This material inhibited the binding of [125I]fibronectin to the streptococci. The inhibitory activity was adsorbed on a column of fibronectin-Sepharose but not on a column of unsubstituted Sepharose 4B or egg albumin Sepharose. The receptor appeared to be a protein nature since the inhibitory activity of the trypsinate was destroyed by papain and was not absorbed on a column containing monoclonal antibodies directed against lipoteichoic acid bound to protein A-Sepharose. Binding sites in fibronectin for streptococci and staphylococci, respectively, were localized by analyzing the ability of isolated fragments to inhibit [125I]fibronectin binding to bacteria and by adsorbing 125I-labeled tryptic fragments with staphylococcal and streptococcal cells. Both species of bacteria appeared to preferentially bind a fragment (Mr = approximately 25,000) originating from the N-terminal region of the protein. In addition, streptococci also bound a slightly smaller fragment (Mr = approximately 23,000). Fibronectin receptors solubilized from either streptococci or staphylococci inhibited the binding of fibronectin to both species of bacteria.
TI  - Cefuroxime in acute septic arthritis.
AB  - Cefuroxime was used in 17 patients with clinical, bacteriological and/or laboratory signs of acute septic arthritis in comparison with 10 patients given cloxacillin and ampicillin alone, or in combination. 14 patients in the study group had positive cultures (Staphylococcus aureus, 10, S. epidermidis, 1, Streptococcus pyogenes group G, 2 and Acinetobacter, 1). Three more patients with non-bacterial arthritis were included in an antibiotic penetration study. In 6 patients serum and joint fluid concentrations of cefuroxime were repeatedly determined by an assay using high pressure liquid chromatography. After 1.5 g intravenous cefuroxime the joint fluid concentrations were 16-80 and 5-40 mg/l at 2 and 8 h, respectively, exceeding the serum concentrations during that period of time. From the clinical and pharmacokinetic data a dosage of 1.5 g cefuroxime intravenously t.i.d. is recommended to the adult patient. This high dosage resulted in primary healing in 11 patients with one relapse one year later in a patient with a knee arthroplasty. Half the dosage intramuscularly in 6 patients failed in 2. No side effects were seen during cefuroxime therapy.
TI  - Bacterial sinusitis.
AB  - Sinusitis may occur secondary to infectious agents, allergens, or pollutants. Bacteriologic studies carried out from sinus punctures revealed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial pathogens isolated. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are not uncommon pathogens. Complications of sinusitis, including orbital cellulitis, usually are due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus and H influenzae. The recent increase in certain areas of the country of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H influenzae is noted. When the etiology remains to be determined in the patient with acute bacterial sinusitis, initial therapy with an oral cephalosporin seems warranted.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Activity of common antibiotics against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in 1983.
AB  - The activity of phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV), ampicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  chloramphenicol, co trimoxazole, doxycycline and erythromycin against clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in 1983 was investigated with the MIC-method (plate-dilution technique). Forty-six percent of B. catarrhalis, 2% of H. influenzae and 78% of S. aureus were beta-lactamase producing and had high MIC-values for penicillin and ampicillin. Thus MIC for 90% of all strains of B. catarrhalis was 32 mg/l and 8 mg/l for penicillin and ampicillin while MIC for 90% of non beta-lactamase producing Branhamella strains was 2 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l respectively. This indicates a high susceptibility of penicillins to the action of Branhamella beta-lactamase. Almost all strains of B. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group A streptococci and S. aureus were inhibited at low concentrations of erythromycin. However, 4 mg/l was required to inhibit 90% of H. influenzae. Co-trimoxazole and doxycycline had good activity against all B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae strains while a few pneumococci, streptococci and staphylococci had intermediate sensitivity or were resistant. Essentially all strains were sensitive to cefuroxime and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Clindamycin and its action on the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to phagocytosis.
AB  - The role of various surface virulence factors in bacterial resistance to opsonophagocytosis has been investigated in relation to the effect of clindamycin at concentrations below those which inhibit growth (sub-MIC). In each case studied (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis) contact with the drug under these conditions potentiated complement-mediated opsonization of the bacterial cells resulting in a greater and more rapid deposition of C3 as C3b on the cell surface. Several other features of the phagocytic process were enhanced in consequence.
TI  - Ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  - The present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (PFN). Avid binding of 125I-PFN was found for Streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), Streptococcus sanguis, group A Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible PFN binding ability. Two gram-negative bacterial species, Bacteroides gingivalis and Escherichia coli, did not significantly bind PFN. 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled PFN, and the radiolabeled PFN bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled PFN. Strong inhibition of 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. These results suggest that PFN binding to S. mutans cells is reversible and that PFN receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.
TI  - Characteristics of non-clinical mammary infections of goats.
AB  - This study, carried out on 1217 milk goats (2428 milk samples), sampled at two different periods of lactation, showed that non-clinical mammary infections of the goat were due to major pathogens (7.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (24.1%). Among major pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species (75.2%). However, great variations were observed between herds, in levels of infection by major pathogens. The intensity of the inflammatory response, measured by the cell count, depended on the pathogen present in the mammary gland. Evidence was found that 75% of infections persisted throughout the lactation and 61% during the dry-period. The arithmetic mean cell counts for milk samples from halves infected with major pathogens was 6.77 X 10(6) cells/ml, determined by Coulter Counter. It was 1.78 and 1.54 X 10(6) cells/ml respectively for halves infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and non-infected halves. The arithmetic mean cell counts were higher at drying-off than in lactation. The threshold of 1 X 10(6) cells/ml was reliable for diagnosis in mid-lactation and permitted to diagnose 72% of major pathogen infections.
TI  - Isolation of pathogenic bacteria from the nasopharynx of children with respiratory syncytial virus infection. Predictive value of chest roentgen examination and laboratory tests.
AB  - Potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the nasopharynx in 33/66 hospitalized infants and children with verified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The value of chest roentgenograms and blood counts for the prediction of concomitant bacterial infection was evaluated. Abnormal chest roentgenograms were found in 89% whether pathogenic bacteria were present or not. The most common finding was general hyperinflation of the lungs, with or without infiltrates. This occurred more frequently in the group with isolated RSV infection. Fever, leucocytosis and an elevated ESR were found during the illness in more than half the cases. These findings were more frequent in children who harboured potential pathogenic bacteria, though the difference was not significant. For optimal evaluation of a case all available information about it should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Pathogenic organisms in chronic suppurative otitis media in Enugu, Nigeria.
AB  - Pathogenic organisms in chronic suppurative otitis media from 62 patients were identified. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was responsible in 46%, Staphylococcus aureus in 29%. Proteus mirabilis in 13%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6%, Aspergillus niger in 5% and Mucor sp. in 2%. The most prevalent organism in children was Staphylococcus aureus. The role of fungi in chronic suppurative otitis media is discussed.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: a summary of in vitro antibacterial qualities including recommendations for susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms disks.
AB  - The new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the Enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (MIC50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), Neisseria species (MIC50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (MIC50 0.25 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 0.015 micrograms/ml). Ceftriaxone was less effective against Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species (MIC50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type IV cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. Type I cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. Based on analysis of disk-MIC regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. These criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. Ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of palmitoyltuberactinamine N and di-beta-lysylcapreomycin IIA.
AB  - Palmitoyltuberactinamine N (Pal-Tua N) and di-beta-lysylcapreomycin IIA (di-beta-Lys-Cpm IIA), which are synthetic derivatives of the antituberculous agent tuberactinomycin (Tum) and capreomycin (Cpm) respectively, were tested for anti-bacterial activity. Pal-Tua N inhibited not only tuberactinomycin-resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis but also Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, although it has lost activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Di-beta-Lys-Cpm IIA inhibited the growth of laboratory-derived Tum-resistant M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis as well as Tum-resistant M. tuberculosis from patients with one exceptional case.
TI  - Amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid for the treatment of soft tissue infections in children.
AB  - We compared responses to amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (ACA) with a cefaclor regimen in children with skin and soft tissue infections (impetigo and cellulitis) due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus species. All isolates from the 41 patients we were able to evaluate were susceptible to ACA by disk susceptibility testing at the onset of treatment. The 21 children receiving ACA and 18 (90%) of 20 taking cefaclor responded to therapy. Clinical cure was achieved in 18 (86%) of 21 and 18 (90%) of 20 in the two groups, respectively. Bacteriological failure occurred in 2 (10%) patients in the cefaclor group and none in the group receiving ACA; however, there were 2 (9%) relapses and 1 (5%) reinfection among the 21 children taking ACA. Adverse effects, although mild, occurred more commonly (9 of 21 versus 1 of 20; P = 0.005) with ACA than with cefaclor.
TI  - [Antifungal and antimicrobial activity of beta-ionone and vitamin A derivatives].
AB  - The antifungal and antimicrobic activity of some derivatives of beta-ionon and vitamin A was studied. These compounds (citral, pseudo-ionon. beta-ionon aldehyde C14, ketone C18 and its derivatives--4,18-diketone, alcohol C18, semicarbazide ketone C18), as well as vitamin A and its derivatives--retinal, acetate, retinoic acid--differ in composition, structure and substituents of C-atoms in beta-ionon ring and in polyenoic chain. Fusarium solani, Botrytis cenerea and Verticillum dahliae II, race 447 were used as test organisms when studying the antifungal activity. When studying the antimicrobic activity, ketone C18 and alcohol C18 were tested using the museum strains Staphylococcus aureus 209 P, hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes FF-38, Streptococcus sp. TOM-1606, Micrococcus luteus 2665, as well as the strains Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pyoderma patients. The antifungal activity was determined by inhibition of spore germination, and the antimicrobic activity--by the value of areas of growth inhibition of the test organisms on the agar medium. All the compounds mentioned above possessed the antifungal activity against all the phytopathogenes used. The degree of this activity depends on the composition and structure of both the cyclic part and polyenoic chain. on the number of conjugated unsaturations, substituents and end groups of C-atom. Ketone C18 is the most active one. It inhibits spore germination by 100-94% at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.005% and 24 h exposure, and by 100% at the concentration of 0.1% and 72 h exposure. Alcohol C18 possesses almost the same antifungul activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Minor burn injuries in children: inpatient versus outpatient treatment?
AB  - Seventy-two children with minor superficial burns presented at our casualty department over a 5-month period. Half were treated as inpatients and the other half as outpatients. The colonisation rates were similar in the two groups. Colonised and sterile burns treated as inpatients showed no significant difference in healing rates. The healing time, however, was prolonged in colonised outpatient treated burns. Cosmetic results were satisfactory overall. In the absence of a definite benefit from inpatient treatment, outpatient care of a child with a minor burn should therefore be used if circumstances allow.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - MDL 19,592 is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a good therapeutic potential against Gram-positive bacterial infections when administered orally or parenterally. In the oral treatment of benzylpenicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice, MDL 19,592 was superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefaclor, cefadroxil and cefroxadine. These in vivo results reflect the in vitro superiority expressed by MDL 19,592 over the other oral cephalosporins against staphylococci. Additionally, MDL 19,592 orally was superior to cefazolin and cephalothin administered subcutaneously and to a number of penicillinase-resistant penicillins given orally or subcutaneously in the treatment of S. aureus mouse infections. MDL 19,592 killed S. aureus cells at the same or faster rate than did cephalexin or cephradine. As compared to cephalexin, MDL 19,592 was marginally superior in vitro against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In vivo, MDL 19,592 was significantly the more effective of the two against S. pyogenes and marginally more effective against S. pneumoniae. Against Gram-negative organisms, with the exception of Haemophilus influenzae, cephalexin was the more potent of the two antibiotics both in vitro and in vivo. Administered orally to mice, MDL 19,592 was absorbed as rapidly as cephalexin with both drugs attaining similar concentrations in the blood. MDL 19,592, like cephalexin, was minimally bound by mouse serum.

TI  - Rwandese herbal remedies used against gonorrhoea.
AB  - In the course of systematic studies on biologically active substances from medicinal plants of Rwanda (Central Africa) we have screened the indigenous drugs used against gonorrhoea for their antimicrobial activity. From the 25 plants tested, 16 were found to have an activity against Neisseria gonorrhoea and N. meningitidis, 6 against Streptococcus pyogenes and 5 against Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, out of 23 indigenous drugs, 17 remedies (74%) were found to be associated with one or more plants with an activity against gonorrhoea.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  - The utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. With a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated with human brain abscess was determined. Two strains of Escherichia coli were more infective than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Even between the E. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. The E. coli strain with the K-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the E. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. The brain was also susceptible to Candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. Brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.
TI  - The value of bacteriology and serology in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Fourteen patients with necrotizing fasciitis are described. In thirteen the cause was Streptococcus pyogenes [Group A beta haemolytic streptococcus (BHS)]; in the fourteenth, Staphylococcus aureus was responsible. In the acute fulminating form of the disease, BHS can be cultured from the affected tissues. In the less acute form, particularly when the patient has been previously treated with antibiotics, other bacteria colonize the tissues and the BHS cannot be isolated. Serological evidence of infection with Streptococcus pyogenes can be ascertained in all such patients by finding high levels of anti-desoxyribonuclease B and anti-hyaluronidase. Measurement of the anti-streptolysin O titre is not helpful. Once the diagnosis is made, surgical removal of all necrotic tissue is still the treatment of choice.
TI  - Parapneumonic pleural effusion and empyema in children. Review of a 19-year experience, 1962-1980.
AB  - Between 1962 and 1980, 50 children admitted to Strong Memorial Hospital had a pleural effusion or an empyema associated with pneumonia. Such parapneumonic effusion and empyema accounted for 52 per cent of cases of pleural effusion and empyema of all etiologies admitted during those years. Review of cases of parapneumonic effusion and empyema suggested that clinical manifestations, laboratory, and roentgenographic findings did not separate these two groups of patients before thoracentesis was performed. Specific organisms were identified in 29 per cent of cases with parapneumonic effusion and 62 per cent with parapneumonic empyema. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were responsible for 35, 30, and 20 per cent of cases, respectively. Parapneumonic effusions were treated without closed-chest tube drainage in 76 per cent of the cases, while closed-chest drainage was necessary in virtually all cases of children with empyema.
TI  - Etiology and treatment of facial cellulitis in pediatric patients.
AB  - By a retrospective chart review patients with buccal cellulitis were divided into groups with and without a probable portal of entry of infection at the time of diagnosis. Tooth abscesses or breaks in the skin were the usual portals of entry. Patients with a portal of entry were significantly older (P less than 0.001), had lower white blood cell counts on admission (P less than 0.01) and recovered more rapidly (P = 0.001). Haemophilus influenzae type b was recovered only from those with no portal of entry. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes caused infection in both groups but were more frequent in those with a portal of entry. Bacteremia was proved only in the group with no portal, and H. influenzae b grew from 14 to 15 positive blood cultures. All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid yielded no growth. We suggest that patients with no portal of entry on presentation receive initial parenteral therapy for H. influenzae b and Gram-positive cocci. Our current regimen is a combination of a semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillin such as oxacillin and chloramphenicol. Oxacillin alone is indicated for those with a break in the skin leading to infection, whereas penicillin is appropriate for patients with dental infection. This initial therapy should be altered depending upon culture results when available.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activity in oral microorganisms.
AB  - Samples were taken from blood accumulated in dental alveoli after surgical removal of mandibular third molars, from subgingival plaque of teeth with advanced periodontal destructions, from teeth with infected necrotic pulps, and from subjects suffering from angular cheilitis. Of the microorganisms subcultured from these samples, 116 strains were assayed for enzymes degrading fibrinogen and fibrin. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen were assayed with the thin-layer enzyme assay cultivation technique. This assay involves the cultivation of microorganisms on culture agars applied over fibrinogen-coated polystyrene surfaces. Enzymes degrading fibrin were assayed with both a plate assay and a tube assay, in which fibrin was mixed with a microbial culture medium. Microorganisms degrading fibrinogen or fibrin or both were isolated from all sampling sites. Activity was mainly detected in strains of Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus aureus. Most Fusobacterium strains degraded fibrinogen only. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen as well as enzymes degrading fibrin via activation of plasminogen were revealed in strains of Clostridium, S. aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. It was generally found that fibrinogen was degraded by more strains than was fibrin, which indicates that different proteases may be involved.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new injectable cephamycin antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial activity, concentration in serum and urine, penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as clinical application. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibilities of clinically isolated K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae to T-1982 were superior to those of CEZ CMZ, and ABPC. T-1982 seemed to be useful for various infections due to Gram-negative rods. 2. Concentration in serum and urine: Subjects were 10 children with congenital heart failure but no abnormal renal and liver functions. T-1982 was given intravenously to 3 groups at 200 mg/kg by one shot (4 cases), 20 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases) and 10 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases). The half-lives were 60, 78 and 85 minutes, respectively. 3. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid: Three children with malignant tumor were injected 20 mg/kg intravenously. A small amount of T-1982 was penetrated into CSF. 4. Clinical efficacy: T-1982 was administered daily 40-116 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 2-14 days to 17 children comprising 1 bronchopneumonia, 1 bronchitis, 4 tonsillitis, 1 lymphadenitis, 1 sepsis, 1 pharyngitis, 1 impetigo, 1 acute sinusitis and 6 pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 2, fair and poor in 3, and the efficacy rate was 70.6%. Bacteriological effect was as follows; eradicated in 9 cases and unknown in 8 cases. As side effect, GOT and GPT elevations unrelated to the drug were observed in 2 cases. Other abnormal findings were not found. T-1982 seems to be safe antibiotic in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - Mediation of staphylococcal adherence to mucosal cells by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid markedly reduced adherence by Staphylococcus aureus to buccal cells in vitro, suggesting that lipoteichoic acid mediates adherence by that bacterium. Adherence inhibition by lipoteichoic acid was lost after deacylation of the preparation, suggesting that fatty acids on the molecule are essential to binding.
TI  - Binding of human fibronectin to group A, C, and G streptococci.
AB  - A total of 387 bacterial strains belonging to 35 species were tested in direct binding experiments for the uptake of purified radiolabeled human fibronectin. Positive binding was found in group A, C, and G streptococci and in Staphylococcus aureus. The group C streptococcal species Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equi, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were uniformly reactive with fibronectin. Beta-hemolytic bovine group G streptococci showed the same degree of reactivity as human group G strains. In contrast, only 4 out of 15 alpha-hemolytic bovine group G strains were able to bind fibronectin. The uptake of fibronectin measured at room temperature with a human group G streptococcus was a slow, time-dependent process with maximum binding after approximately 1 h. Human polyclonal immunoglobulin G and serum albumin tested in inhibition experiments did not affect the fibronectin binding. Fibronectin seems, therefore, to interact with a surface component that is different from the specific binding sites previously described for human immunoglobulin G and serum albumin.

AB  - The antibacterial effect of josamycin has been tested in vitro on strains of S. Aureus, Str. Pyogenes and Str. Pneumoniae isolated during 1981 from human liquor, blood and purulent secretions. It is confirmed that even modest doses of the antibiotic have this effect upon S. Aureus strains which are resistant to several antibiotics including erythromycin and lincomycin. In some cases, although bacteriostasis occurred, bacterial survival indices were fairly modest.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of Haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures in the detection of antibodies to Haemophilus somnus was investigated. H. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium pyogenes. In complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only H. agni reacted with H. somnus antisera to any significant degree. In ELISA tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two Pasteurella spp. and with H. agni. When whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in ELISAs, only H. agni showed any cross-reactivity. The greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by ELISA with saline extracts as antigens. Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus antigens failed to react with H. somnus antibody in any of the tests. A rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of P. multocida, P. haemolytica, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dublin, C. pyogenes, and E. coli gave no positive reaction in ELISA tests with saline extract of H. somnus as antigen. It is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of H. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by ELISA of antibody response to H. somnus.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Comparison of a miniaturized culture test and sheep blood agar for the recovery of Group A streptococci from throat cultures.
AB  - A miniaturized culture test (strep test) was compared with conventional sheep blood agar (SBA) for the detection of Group A streptococci (GAS) from throat swabs. A total of 355 throat cultures were obtained in duplicate from symptomatic children and assessed by the two methods after overnight incubation. GAS were detected in 109 specimens by the strep test, in 100 specimens by SBA and in 118 specimens by both methods. There was no significant difference between the recovery rate of GAS by the strep test (92.4%) and SBA (84.7%) (0.1 greater than P greater than 0.05). The strep test was 85.2% specific for detection of GAS. The rates of false positive and false negative reactions with the strep test were 24.3 and 4.3%, respectively. Beta-hemolytic streptococci other than Group A, Staphylococcus aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococci produced false positive reactions. The viability of GAS on the strep test was also tested. GAS were recovered from 27 of 28 (96.4%) strep tests at 24 hours and 25 of 27 (92.6%) tests at 72 hours after inoculation. These results indicate that strep test is as sensitive as the conventional SBA method in recovering GAS. The strep test is simple to use, is easy to interpret and has a long shelf life. Because of the high rate of false positive results (24.3%), this test may not be the best alternative method to SBA for use in office practice.
TI  - Lack of virus-specific bacterial adherence to bovine embryonic lung cells infected with bovine parainfluenza virus type 3.
AB  - Infection of bovine embryonic lung cells with bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 did not induce in vitro, virus-specific, hemadsorption-related adherence of Corynebacterium pyogenes, Haemophilus somnus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Brucella sp., or Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Binding of aggregated IgG Fab-fragments and light chains to some group A, C and G streptococci.
AB  - Receptors for IgG Fc in many group A, C and G streptococci have been reported previously. We now describe a reaction between group A, C and G streptococci and IgG Fab-parts, not involving the antigen combining sites. The bacteria proved to bind aggregated, but not monomeric, IgG Fab-fragments, indicating that multivalent interaction was a prerequisite for the binding to occur. Most of the strains exhibiting affinity for aggregated IgG Fab could also interact with aggregated K and/or lambda light chains. The capacity of the single strains to bind aggregated IgG Fab did not correlate with presence of IgG Fc-receptor activity. Furthermore, in contrast to streptococcal Fc-receptors, the streptococcal structure reacting with Fab was highly sensitive to trypsin as well as phosphatase treatment. The binding of aggregated lambda-chains to each of two strains tested was inhibited by liquoid and aggregated human albumin, suggesting that lipoteichoic acid and/or M protein are responsible for the binding of IgG Fab-fragments. A pronounced binding of aggregated IgG Fab, but not light chains, to Staphylococcus aureus, strain Cowan I, was also found. Various other bacterial species were tested for binding of the aggregates, with negative results.
TI  - Platelet aggregation by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Heat-killed group A Streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). Inhibition of the reaction by 3 mM EDTA indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. Lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did not occur during a 6-min incubation period. Aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microM to 10 mM) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microM), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. S. pyogenes induced the release of [14C]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. Gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. Staphylococcus aureus, a group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute otitis media in Japanese children.
AB  - Bacteriologic investigations were performed on 100 children with acute otitis media by culturing the fluid from a myringotomy site. Patients ranged in age from 7 months to 14 years, and 91 were younger than 6 years old. Bacterial isolates were yielded from cultures in 83 cases, and mixtures of two or three organisms were obtained from 15 patients. Among the total of 100 isolates, the most predominant organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (28), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (26), Staphylococcus aureus (19), and Streptococcus pyogenes (six). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin sodium against S pneumoniae and H influenzae were 0.016 to 0.032 and 0.25 to 0.5 mg/L, respectively. None of the strains of H influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. The MICs of dicloxacillin sodium, cephalexin monohydrate, cefaclor, and erythromycin to H influenzae were 8 to 32, 8 to 16, 2 to 8, and 2 to 8 mg/L, respectively. The preferred drug for acute otitis media would be ampicillin in Japan, but we have to consider antistaphylococcal antibiotics for the patients who do not respond to 48 hours of treatment.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. The compound showed moderate activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against Enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. The MBC was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than MIC. Medium composition, pH and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. About 50% of recent clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. Killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to MIC or two- to fourfold higher. However, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. Combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. Antagonism was never observed. Human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. Binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
TI  - Crystal formation induced by uropathogenic bacteria. An in vitro study in human urine.
AB  - Human urine was studied in regard to precipitation of crystals under various experimental conditions. These included alkalization of the urine by adding NaOH or by inoculation with Proteus bacteria. The contents of calcium and magnesium in the urinary supernatant after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C were significantly lower after inoculation with Proteus bacteria than in noninoculated urine. Microscopy of the sediments showed distinct crystalline aggregations after the bacterial inoculation. Inoculation with killed Proteus organisms did not lead to crystalline precipitation in otherwise identical experiments. The effect of other live bacteria was also studied. The mechanism of crystal formation in bacteria-inoculated urine is discussed.
TI  - Activation of the alternate complement pathway by peptidoglycan of Actinomyces viscosus, a potentially pathogenic oral bacterium.
AB  - Peptidoglycans and cells walls from Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus,  and group A streptococcus were compared for their relative abilities to activate the alternate complement pathway (ACP). On the dry-weight basis, the peptidoglycan from A. viscosus was 3.5 times more active than group A streptococcal peptidoglycan and 15.6 times more active than Staph. aureus peptidoglycan in activating the ACP. Consequently A. viscosus peptidoglycan is one of the most potent ACP-activators reported to date. For both A. viscosus and group A streptococcus, the peptidoglycan was a better ACP activator than cell walls from the same organism (125- and 52-fold, respectively) indicating that the peptidoglycan is probably the most important subcellular ACP-activator in these microorganisms. In contrast, cell walls from Staph, aureus were 9 times more active than peptidoglycan from Staph. aureus in activating the ACP, presumably because teichoic acids are the most important subcellular ACP activator in this microorganism.
TI  - Clinical trial of bacampicillin in acute bacterial infections.
AB  - A clinical trial of bacampicillin was carried out in 20 patients. The antibiotic  was found to be effective in acute lobar pneumonia, pyogenic meningitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, cellulitis, furunculosis, and pyomyositis caused by such ampicillin-sensitive organisms as Neisseria meningitidis, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Rash in three patients was the only side effect encountered. It is concluded that while bacampicillin may have overcome some of the disadvantages of ampicillin, it retains its main attributes and some shortcomings.
TI  - [Experimental mastitis in cows caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci and Corynebacteria].
AB  - Mastitis was experimentally induced in seven cows of the Black-and-white breed through the intramammary or i/v application of bacterial cultures of the encapsulated variant of Staph. epidermidis as well as of Str. agalactiae and Cor. pyogenes. The disease ran a course with high body temperature, strongly manifested inflammatory changes in the mammary gland, and altered phagocytic activity. It was found that the introduction into the mammary gland of a 'stable-specific' bovine blood serum in combination with the preparation nitrofuridine (a Shiff base of the 5-nitrofurfurol with sulfaguanidine) which boosts the phagocytic activity, had produced a therapeutic effect.
TI  - A controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  - Optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. We studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double blind comparative trial. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. Clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included Streptococcus pneumoniae (14), Haemophilus influenzae type b (5), H. influenzae nontypeable (3), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Branhamella sp. (2), and Streptococcus pyogenes (1). Nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included Streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and Streptococcus viridans. Two aspirates were sterile. A satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of 19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. We conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.
TI  - Survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  - Lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). Structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. Cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of Trypan Blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. The membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded Trypan Blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. Among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the Aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. Thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. Furthermore, the use of Trypan Blue uptake as a measure of cell death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.
TI  - Detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  - Intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. Because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. Alveolar lining material from rats caused rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. The antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. Phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. Lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. The surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated methyl-D-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. Bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Bacillus species. Purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.

AB  
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. Both compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus and Providencia; the great majority of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. All Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. The isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). There were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. Both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.
TI  - [Isolation and evaluation of properties of muramidase causing the lysis of group  A streptococci].
AB  - Muramidase which actively lyses the cell walls of group A hemolytic streptococci  has been isolated from the culture fluid of Actinomyces levoris by precipitation on ammonium sulfate, gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose and double electrofocusing. The enzyme thus obtained has shown its maximum activity at 40-50 degrees C. At 60 degrees C muramidase was completely inactivated. The enzyme has a wide range of optimum pH values: 5.0-9.5. The highest percentage of lysis of streptococcal cell walls has been observed in plycine-NaOH and potassium phosphate buffers at pH 8.0. Muramidase completely lysed Streptococcus pyogenes cells of different serological groups except enterococci (group D) and staphylococci. This sign allows to differentiate group D streptococcus from streptococci of other groups.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of R-plasmids from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - R-plasmids originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC1,pAM15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH2-2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in S. aureus recipients.

TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive cocci was studied by microdilution broth susceptibility tests and compared with the activities of clindamycin, vancomycin, oxacillin, and ampicillin. U-57930E inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. This degree of activity was generally slightly less than that of the other antimicrobial agents tested. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci were resistant to U-57930E. At the concentrations used, U-57930E exhibited bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms, and a minimal effect of inoculum size was noted.

TI  - A microbiological study of polyarthritis in slaughter pigs.
AB  - Arthritic joints obtained from 50 freshly slaughtered pig carcasses condemned for polyarthritis were studied microbiologically. A routine technique was developed for aseptically opening joints to obtain material for microbiological examination. A standard series of culture media for the primary isolation of arthritogenic agents were used in the examination of each affected joint. The microbiological study cultured for isolation of the following microorganisms: Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Chlamydia, and viruses.E. rhusiopathiae was found to be responsible for 48% of the cases of arthritis and Streptococcus spp., C. pyogenes and S. aureus for 20%, 4%, and 2% respectively; no microorganisms were cultured from 26% of the arthritic joints.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Evidence for antibacterial activity of endodontic gutta-percha cones.
AB  - In the presence of endodontic gutta-percha cones, several species of bacteria were killed in vitro. Silver points, when compared with gutta-percha cones, were not or were considerably less effective against the target organism. Staphylococcus aureus, in our assay system. Growth of bacteria in serum could be abolished by the mere presence of gutta-percha, especially when time was allowed for previous contact between the serum and the cones. It is concluded that gutta-percha cones possess a slowly acting, relatively weak, but, in our opinion, significant inherent antimicrobial property.
TI  - Cefuroxime therapy for pneumonia in infants and children.
AB  - Because Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b and Staphylococcus aureus are the major causes of bacterial pneumonia in infancy, we customarily have given a beta-lactam antibiotic and chloramphenicol as initial antibiotic therapy. Cefuroxime (75 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours iv or im) was evaluated as single drug therapy in an open study of 100 infants and children with suspected bacterial pneumonia. The mean serum concentration of cefuroxime 30 minutes after a 15-minute infusion of 25 mg/kg iv was 29.1 micrograms/ml, and the volume of distribution was 695 ml/kg. Pleural fluid concentrations in 3 specimens were 2.2, 8.5 and 11 micrograms/ml. Median age of patients was 15 months. Bacterial etiology was established in 20 patients: H. influenzae b (8 patients); pneumococcus (8 patients); S. aureus (2 patients); Group A streptococcus (1 patient); Neisseria meningitidis B (1 patient). All organisms were susceptible to 1.25-micrograms/ml doses or less of cefuroxime. The mean number of days was 3.1 until patients became afebrile and 5.1 until respiratory symptoms were gone. Eosinophilia occurred in 10 patients. Cefuroxime is safe and effective single drug therapy for pneumonia in infants and children.
TI  - Studies on bacterial hypersensitivity in man. Interrelationship between skin reactions to bacterial peptidoglycan and serum peptidoglycan antibody titers.
AB  - The nature and extent of bacterially induced allergies are difficult to define. Since peptidoglycan, the main component of the cell wall of almost all bacteria, has been available in a highly purified, chemically and immunologically well-defined form, investigation of the allergological significance of this cell component is feasible. Intracutaneous tests were carried out on 181 test subjects with five different peptidoglycan (PG) preparations from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus Pyogenes. The results of the investigation were compared with the result of determination of serum PG antibodies and serum IgE concentrations. It was shown that test subjects with dual and later reactions to three different staphylococcal PGs displayed significantly higher PG antibody titers than test subjects with negative reactions. Such a relationship could not be found with the cutaneous reactions to streptococcal PG. The total serum IgE values were very much higher in test subjects with immediate reactions to staphylococcal PG than in test subjects with a negative reaction. Typical Arthus reaction or late granulomatous reactions were not observed. Humoral antibodies are involved at least in part in the elicitation of dual and late reactions. Thus, there are interesting parallels to allergy to fungal spores and organic dusts.
TI  - Cationic polyelectrolytes, liquoid and leukocyte extract modulate the binding of  IgG to group A streptococcal Fc-receptors.
AB  - Various polyelectrolytes were investigated regarding their capacity to inhibit the binding of human IgG to Fc-receptors on group A streptococci, type M1. Of cationic substances, protamine and arginine-rich histone inhibited significantly, while lysine-rich histone, concanavalin A, lysozyme, polymyxin B, ribonuclease and tuftsin did not. Of anionic materials, liquoid was inhibitory, in contrast to chondroitin sulphate, dextran sulphate, DNA and heparin. Washing experiments showed that the inhibition was caused by binding of the polyelectrolytes to the streptococci. The finding that heated IgG inhibited the binding of histone to the streptococci also indicated a close relation between the binding sites for these compounds. Diffusion-in-gel experiments with alkaline extract of M1 demonstrated that the substances blocking the IgG Fc-receptor were bound to polyglycerophosphate, suggesting that the inhibition of the IgG uptake was due to interaction with lipoteichoic acid. Leukocyte and platelet extracts could modify the binding of IgG, probably by an enzymatic digestion of the receptors. The arginine-rich histone was also capable of inhibiting the binding of IgG to type M15 group A streptococci and to one group G strain. However, the polyelectrolytes had no effect on the binding of IgG to Staphylococcus aureus or of IgA to type 4 group A streptococci.
TI  - Isoelectric points and surface hydrophobicity of Gram-positive cocci as determined by cross-partition and hydrophobic affinity partition in aqueous two-phase systems.
AB  - Thirty-nine streptococcal strains belonging to groups A, C, and G and 12 staphylococcal strains were investigated with respect to surface charge and hydrophobicity. Isoelectric points of the bacteria were determined by cross-partition experiments in dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase systems containing charged polymers. The results obtained indicate that group A, C, and G streptococci have isoelectric points of pH 3.75 +/- 0.15 standard deviation. Staphylococci show an isoelectric point of around pH 2 and thereby differ markedly from the streptococci. Pretreatment of bacteria with human serum resulted in a significant change in the isoelectric points of streptococci. In a second series of experiments, an aqueous dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase system containing polyethylene glycol palmitate or stearate was used to study the hydrophobic surface properties of the bacterial cells. The partition of the staphylococci was not influenced by the addition of up to 1% (wt/wt) polyethylene glycol palmitate or stearate, whereas the streptococci showed a large variation in affinity for polyethylene glycol-bound hydrophobic groups. The bacterial strains included in the study were also tested for uptake of human serum proteins. A positive correlation was found between the hydrophobic affinity of group A streptococci and the density of receptors for aggregated beta-2-microglobulin.
TI  - Septic bursitis in childhood.
AB  - Ten cases of septic bursitis in children during a 25 year period were reviewed. Infection occurred in five girls and five boys with a mean age of 9 1/6 years. None had prior bursal disease. Direct trauma or local infection preceded the bursitis in seven children. The involved bursae were prepatellar (eight), olecranon (one), and subacromial (one). Presenting signs included fever with localized swelling, tenderness, and erythema; superficial fluctuance and painless joint motion were helpful diagnostic findings. Bursal fluid cultures yielded Staphylococcus aureus (nine) and Streptococcus pyogenes (one). Surgical therapy included needle aspiration (three), incision and drainage (three), and both procedures (four). Antimicrobial therapy was given to nine children; four received only oral antimicrobials. Nine children including all who received oral antimicrobials recovered rapidly without apparent sequelae. One child's course was complicate by patellar osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. Septic bursitis is an uncommon infection in children and should be differentiated from cellulitis and septic arthritis. Rapid recovery is usually seen with appropriate therapy.
TI  - A retrospective study of microbiologic samples from oral mucosal lesions.
AB  - This report describes findings in microbial samples from 271 patients with lesions of the oral mucous membranes. Analyses were made on the basis of direct microscopy and cultivation on nonselective and selective media incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Growth of bacteria was semiquantitatively determined according to a five-grade scale. Among the 134 samples for direct microscopy, fungi in yeast as well as hyphae phase, were identified in 39 cases. Among the cultivated samples, Candida albicans was detected in 107 cases, of which 71 were full-denture wearers. Staphylococcus aureus, coliform bacteria and Klebsiella were the most frequently isolated "nonoral" bacteria. In some cases also Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas or other gram-negative aerobic bacteria were found. In 84 cases the bacteria mentioned were registered as single "nonoral" infection, and in 63 cases combinations of "nonoral" species occurred. In 51 of these 63 cases C. albicans was also involved. In 31 cases a significant quantitative increase of one or more oral bacterial species was registered. In 93 cases there was no indication of a microbial cause of the lesion. On the basis of these microbial findings, it might be presupposed that in the majority of cases microorganisms were of primary or secondary pathogenic importance to the lesions.
TI  - [Clinical studies on 9, 3"-diacetylmidecamycin in respiratory tract infections in the field of pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on 9, 3"-diacetylmidecamycin (MOM), a new macrolide antibiotic in the field of pediatrics, and the results were as follows. Antibacterial activity: For 32 clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, the MIC of MOM ranged from 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml for 17 of the 32 strains, and exceeded 100 micrograms/ml for the 15 remaining strains with both inoculum sizes of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. For 27 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC range was wide, varying from 0.10 to greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml and less than 1.56 micrograms/ml for about 2/3 of all the 27 strains. For 9 strains of Bordetella pertussis, the MIC ranged from 0.10 to 0.78 microgram/ml and 0.10 to 0.39 microgram/ml with the inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml, respectively. Comparing the antibacterial activity of MOM with that of midecamycin (MDM) and erythromycin (EM) against these 3 bacterial species, MOM was almost comparable to MDM, but about 2 or 3 tubes inferior to EM. Absorption and excretion: MOM was administered to 5 children (from 5 to 8 years old) at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg at 30 minutes before breakfast. The peak of serum concentration was observed 30 minutes to 1 hour after administrations of both dosages: 0.52 to 1.71 micrograms/ml with 10 mg/kg and 0.88 to 1.77 micrograms/ml with 20 mg/kg. 0.09 to 1.10% and 0.94 to 1.19% of MOM were excreted in the urine within the first 6 hours, respectively. CLINICAL RESULTS: MOM was administered to 28 pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infections (acute pharyngitis; 2, acute purulent tonsillitis; 19, acute bronchitis; 4, acute pneumonia; 2 and whooping cough; 1). The overall clinical response was excellent in 10, good in 10, fair in 3 and poor in 5; the efficacy rate was 71.4%. Isolated S. pyogenes strains were eradicated in 6 out of 11 strains, reduced in 3 and unchanged in 2 strains. One strain of S. aureus was eradicated. One strain of non group A beta-Streptococcus was reduced. Haemophilus influenzae strains were reduced in 1 of the 4 strains and unchanged in 3 strains. The overall eradication rate was 41.2%. No side effects or abnormal laboratory findings were observed, but 1 case complained of a bitter taste.

TI  - Swabs and swab-transport media kits in the isolation of upper respiratory bacteria.
AB  - The recovery of upper respiratory tract bacteria on laboratory media from a variety of swabs and swab-transport media kits was examined. Organisms studied included strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. Although a wide range of results was obtained with regard to variables such as the type of swab or swab-transport media kit used, the time of plating, the temperature of storage of swab-transport media kits, and the nature of the suspension of the organisms, it was generally noted that recovery of organisms was better from swabs held in their plastic containers prior to plating than from swabs held in transport medium.
TI  - Further experience with augmentin in the treatment of skin infections.
AB  - Thirty-two patients with skin infections were treated with Augmentin, a combination of amoxycillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. These infections were primary skin sepsis (7), infected eczema (11), infected trauma (10) and leg ulcers (4). The majority of cases were caused by amoxycillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus either alone or in combination with Streptococcus pyogenes. Thirty patients (94%) responded to treatment with only one withdrawal (for side effects). Side effects were limited to nausea (9%) diarrhoea (9%) and rash (3%). No patient with diarrhoea showed evidence of Clostridium difficile toxin production in the stools. Augmentin appears to be a safe, useful, effective antibiotic for the treatment of skin infections in general practice and in hospital. It may prove of particular value when mixed infections of penicillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes are present.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis-a disease of temperate and warm climates.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a distinct clinical entity. It is usually due to Streptococcus pyogenes but may occasionally be caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It needs to be considered in relationship to other infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, in which the clinical disease that occurs may be associated with the depth of inoculation of the coccus. Mild cases have been identified that are self-limiting as well as serious cases which would have succumbed without surgical debridement. It is likely that some cases of necrotic tropical ulcer are due to necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae, Pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus: sensitivity of outpatient strains to commonly prescribed antibiotics.
AB  - The degree of resistance of Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus to phenoxymethylpenicillin, ampicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was investigated with the MIC-method (plate-dilution technique). Each bacterial group consisted of 100 outpatient strains. Seven strains of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase-producing. Of the 100 haemophilus strains, 58% were sensitive and the rest intermediate sensitive to erythromycin. 99% were sensitive to doxycycline and all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Essentially all pneumococcal strains were sensitive to the antibiotics tested. However, a few strains demonstrated diminished sensitivity to penicillins. All group A streptococci were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin and chloramphenicol, and 98% were sensitive to erythromycin. Approximately 1 strain out of 5 was resistant to doxycycline. 75% of S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Four of the S., aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin and 8 to doxycycline. The results presented indicate a better antibiotic situation than in some other countries, but suggest the need for a more extensive antibiotic sensitivity examination of isolated bacteria.
TI  - [Modes of the formation of elementary bodies and their isolation from the cell in L-form bacteria].
AB  - Elementary bodies are formed on the cell surface and inside the cell body in all  cell types characteristic of L-form cultures, i. e. spherical cells, large bodies and filament structures. The following ways of elementary body formation are described: by budding on the cell surface, appearance immediately in the cytoplasm, in the vacuole, as a result of cytoplasmic fragmentation accompanied by the lysis of the cell, as well as in cases of the separation of cytoplasmic areas surrounded by the membrane or the myelin-like structure. The release of elementary bodies from the cell occurs as a result of the lysis or death of the mother cell, the thinning of the vacuole wall, and possibly due to small transient defects in the membrane, not accompanied by the death of the mother cell. The scheme of the formation and release of elementary bodies from the cell is presented.

TI  - Skin sepsis in meat handlers: observations on the causes of injury with special reference to bone.
AB  - Outbreaks of wound infection with Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus occurred in a abattoir and a pork-processing factory in Autumn 1980. Investigations showed that staff handling the meat before de-boning were particularly affected and that bone was the cause of 48% of the wounds which became clinicially infected. Of the total isolates of Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus from wounds of known cause 75% were from lesions caused by bone. In one outbreak streptococcal infection was seen principally in newly-employed staff. Group L streptococci were found in several sites in the pork factory and were isolated from infected lesions in two workers. Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus were cultured from tap handles in the lavatories. Sixty-six workers were examined in a non-epidemic period and 59% were found to have current wounds on the hand or wrists; 13% of wounds were infected but Strep. pyogenes was not isolated. Bone was the commonest of the many causes of injury, accounting for 31% of all wounds. Butchers had the highest rates of wounding and most bone-inflicted injury was seen in this group. Packers were the only group to wear protective gloves regularly. Damaged fingernails were found in 50% of workers, including a high proportion of nail-biters (33% of all workers). The epidemic strain of Staph. aureus was cultured from bitten fingernails. Three of four infected workers carrying epidemic organisms in the throat were examined and all were nail-biters. Sharp-edged bone was produced by rotary saws early in the production line and bone dust contaminated the carcasses and adjacent surfaces. It is suggested that bone fragments could contaminate wounds and that this might have implications for the initiation of infection and the development of outbreaks.

AB  
TI  - Cephradine levels in human aqueous humor.
AB  - In an attempt to investigate penetration of cephradine into the primary aqueous humor in man, we administered 500-mg and 1-g doses of cephradine orally to 27 patients about to undergo elective cataract extraction. A mean peak aqueous humor level of 0.87 microgram/mL was obtained at about three hours after the 500-mg dose. The mean peak aqueous humor level after the 1-g dose also occurred at three hours and was 1.99 microgram/mL, with a range from 0.91 to 3.25 microgram/mL. This concentration was greater than the median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cephradine for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus (when tested in nutrient agar) but was greater than the MIC for 90% of isolates only with Str pyogenes.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Protein A-like activity and streptococcal cross-reactions.
AB  - Recognition of the protein A-like activity of some strains of group A streptococci has thrown doubt on much previous work suggesting antigenic cross-reactions between these streptococci and mammalian tissues. The strains used in our previous studies have now been examined by the mixed reverse passive antiglobulin reaction (MRPAH) for the 'non-specific' absorption of purified Fc portion of human IgG. They were found to have only traces of activity. The strain of Staphylococcus aureus used to control 'non-specific' absorption by bacterial cell walls was strongly positive. Protein A-like material as detected in this way was not therefore responsible for our earlier results.

TI  - Studies of the staphylococcal causation of toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - The data presented in this study indicate that the Staphylococcus aureus is related casually to the toxic shock syndrome and that the dominant phage type was 29. This type has occurred singly as well as in combination with phage type 52 and some other group I phage types. The 29, 52 complex was present in approximately two-thirds of a series of 159 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus obtained from patients with toxic shock syndrome, while another fourth was nontypable. In further support of this concept was the evidence that 94.1 per cent of the isolates of the 29, 52 phage complex tested were capable of producing pyrogenic exotoxin C. These results gave confirmatory evidence of the etiologic importance of this phage type complex of Staphylococcus aureus. The high percentage of 25.8 per cent nontypable isolated has remained unexplained, and this is suggestive of the possibility that another important phage type may be present but obscure, since 83 per cent were shown to be capable of producing pyrogenic C toxin. The data reported also indicated that the current activity of this phage type is another manifestation of the versatility of Staphylococcus aureus and its ability to produce different pathogenic strains capable of causing different or new infections in clinical practice.
TI  - Bacteriological study of diabetic foot ulcers.
AB  - Bacteriological study of 61 patients with diabetic gangrene or non-gangrenous foot ulcers was undertaken to determine the pattern of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility with a view to suggest optimal antibiotic therapy for these patients. Gangrenous ulcers showed a higher frequency of mixed infection; the predominant organisms being enterococci, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Klebsiella sp. Infected non-gangrenous ulcers showed Staph. pyogenes, and beta haemolytic Streptococcus as single organism in 12 patients. Anaerobes were more frequently isolated in gangrenous lesions than in non-gangrenous ulcers. Antimicrobial susceptibility showed that gram positive organisms were sensitive to co-trimoxazole, cephaloridine, ampicillin and penicillin. Gram negative aerobic bacilli were sensitive to gentamycin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and streptomycin. Anaerobes were sensitive to chloramphenicol, clindamycin and metronidazole. Antibiotics of choice for gangrenous lesions with spreading infection and septicaemia are a combination of gentamycin, ampicillin and metronidazole as an adjuvant to surgical treatment.

TI  - Participation of immunoglobulins and complement components in the intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by human granulocytes.
AB  - Immunoglobulins and complement components are required for optimal ingestion and  optimal killing of microorganisms by granulocytes. The degree of opsonization of microorganisms necessary for their ingestion was lower than that required for the killing of these bacteria during the ingestion phase. Killing during this phase was found to depend mainly on the presence of heat-labile opsonins, probably C3b, present on the microorganisms. Extracellular immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3b were indispensable for optimal intracellular killing after ingestion was complete. This was established with an assay permitting assessment of the course of the number of viable intracellular bacteria independent of the ingestion of new live bacteria. Maximal intracellular killing by human granulocytes of ingested catalase-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) or catalase-negative (Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae) microorganisms was found only when fresh serum was present extracellularly. Killing was suboptimal in the absence of serum. With heat-inactivated serum, the killing index lay between the indices obtained in the presence and absence of fresh serum. The stimulatory activity of heat-inactivated serum was most probably due to the interaction of IgG with the Fc receptor on the granulocyte membrane, since IgG subclasses IgG1 and IgG3 as well as pFc fragments of IgG stimulated the intracellular killing to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum did. In addition, (Fab1)2 fragments of IgG did not stimulate killing, and reduced killing was observed in the presence of heat-inactivated serum after reduction of the number of Fc receptors. The extra stimulation of the killing process in the presence of fresh serum compared with heat-inactivated serum was due to the interaction between membrane receptors and complement--most probably C3b generated by both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. This conclusion is based on results obtained with sera in which one or both complement pathways were blocked, on the restoration of the killing-stimulatory activity of C3-deficient serum after addition of fresh C3, and on the reduced killing observed in the presence of fresh serum after reduction of the number of C3 receptors by the use of pronase or antigranulocyte serum.
TI  - Peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with LeVeen shunts.
AB  - Six cirrhotic patients are described in whom peritonitis developed from 10 days to 15 months after the insertion of a LeVeen shunt. The presenting clinical features of fever, increasing ascites and deterioration in mental status resembled these previously reported for cirrhotic patients but with spontaneous peritonitis without shunts. Important differences were observed, however, in microbiology, incidence of bacteremia and therapy. Staphylococcus aureus, a rare cause of spontaneous peritonitis, was found in one half of our cases, suggesting that perioperative contamination during shunt placement was an important etiologic factor. All six had concomitant bacteremia which may be attributable to the direct peritoneal-venous connection. Appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy without shunt removal failed to eradicate the infection irrespective of the patency of the shunt or absence of inflammation at the sites of insertion. Recommended treatment for suspected peritonitis in patients with shunts is systemic antimicrobial therapy with an agent active against staphylococci plus an aminoglycoside, followed by removal of the shunt if the diagnosis is confirmed.
TI  - A genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in BSVS mice is not responsible for the limited T-dependent immune responsiveness of BSVS mice.
AB  - BSVS mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. We have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between BSVS and salmonella-resistant A/J mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to H-2, Igh-C, or Hbb, and not X-linked. We have backcrossed the A/J allele at this locus into BSVS mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor T-dependent responsiveness of BSVS mice. The salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the Ity locus described by others.

AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin derivative.
AB  - DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin, was 2-10 times more active in vitro than rifampicin (RAMP) against several clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and only slightly less active than RAMP against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It showed excellent therapeutic activity in mice in experimental infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the experimental TB infection in the mouse DL 473 was clearly more active than isoniazide and RAMP, two of the most effective antitubercular drugs in current use. The LD50 in the mouse was significantly higher than that of RAMP and the half-life was about 5 times longer than that of RAMP.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. All four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). Cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against Enterobacteriaceae with extremely low MIC-values. Ceftazidime was definitely most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. MIC-values for cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. All third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against Streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against Streptococcus faecalis. Moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against Bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. Previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Bacteriologic studies on electronic hospital thermometers.
AB  - Electronic thermometers used in many hospitals require insertion into the mouth of a temperature-sensing probe covered by a pre-packaged probe cover. Handling procedures used by hospital personnel can lead to inadvertent manual contact with the probe cover. We attempted to determine the rate of non-sterility of these probe covers under normal hospital conditions and the extent to which pathogens could be detected on these and other components of the thermometer. Probe covers were removed before entry into the patient's mouth and aseptically inoculated into fluid thioglycollate medium. Subcultures were made to appropriate differential media. Over a 13-week period, 180 covers were cultured on two private hospital services. Forty-three percent were found to be non-sterile; control covers from central supply were only 6% non-sterile. Four percent of the probe covers harbored potential pathogens: coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterobacter, and Bacteroides. No attempt was made to correlate these findings with infection. These results indicated a potential infection hazard for high-risk patient groups and a need by hospital personnel to consider this as a possible source of contamination.
TI  - Streptolysin S activation by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acid from streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus both activated membrane-bound precursor streptolysin S and induced the formation of extracellular streptolysin S. Lipoteichoic acid could replace other substances, such as yeast ribonucleic acid core, that act as carriers for hemolysin but which are not components of the streptococcus or the host. Lipoteichoic acid may play a role as the physiological carrier of streptolysin S to host tissues.
TI  - Etiology of cervical lymphadenitis in children.
AB  - Thirty children under 17 years of age with cervical lymphadenopathy were evaluated. Lymphadenitis was attributed to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in 10 of the patients (33 percent), to Staphylococcus aureus in four and to infectious mononucleosis in four. Two patients had both infectious mononucleosis in Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. One child was affected with Acinetobacter with calcoaceticus (mima) and another with mycobacteria. In eight children (27 percent), no etiologic agent could be found.
TI  - Cellulitis: initial management.
AB  - Although Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause the majority of cellulitis, recent studies have shown a significant role for Hemophilus influenzae in facial, and less frequently, nonfacial infections. We devised an algorithm for the initial management of cellulitis based on our previous investigations showing a correlation of this organism with fever, leukocytosis, and facial involvement. Children were divided into four groups characterized as follows: Group I - extremity, temperature less than 38.5 C; Group II - extremity, temperature greater than 38.5 C, WBC less than 15,000/cu mm; Group III - extremity, temperature greater than 38.5 C, WBC greater than 15,000/cu mm; and Group IV - facial. Forty-five children were successfully followed. There were 34 in Group I, five in Group II, one in Group III, and five in Group IV. Two children in Group IV and the only child in Group III had H influenzae, recovered form the blood (3) or a direct aspirate (1). All three were febrile, with a range of 39.5 C to 40.1 C and has an elevated white blood cell count with a range of 19,200/cu mm to 26,000/cu mm. With one exception, children with cellulitis not due to H influenzae did not have both fever and leukocytosis. This algorithm allows the clinician to identify children with H influenzae cellulitis who are at risk for septic complications while minimizing unnecessary diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotiam (CTM) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of CTM by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), Salmonella typhi (1), and Campylobacter jejuni (1). All but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CTM therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. Diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with the CTM therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum CTM level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of CTM in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the CSF/serum ratio was 9.0%. From these data, CTM appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products to S. aureus and to beta-hemolytic streptococci group A, C and G.
AB  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products was measured to Gram-positive cocci known to carry receptors for human fibrinogen. Forty-one strains of S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci were studied. The largest plasmin produced fragment (X-fragment, HMWDP) showed higher binding levels to the bacterial receptors in all four species as compared to intact fibrinogens. The enzymatically produced C-terminal fragment D was strongly reactive, whereas the N-terminal fragment E was non-reactive. Inhibition experiments showed that reactive fragments were bound to the same receptors as fibrinogen. Three chemically-produced and well-characterized fragments from the terminal and the middle portions of the fibrinogen molecule were all negative in binding assays. The binding patterns for fibrinogen and the fragments tested were identical in the four bacterial species tested, S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci. The results confirm and extend earlier data on similarities between fibrinogen receptors on these Gram-positive bacterial species.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - Adverse reactions to parenteral lincomycin.
AB  - Lincomycin use has not been reported exclusively in children and inasmuch as it has been extensively used at our institution, a chart review of 265 patients who received parenteral lincomycin at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for five days or longer was undertaken. The following conditions were diagnosed: cellulitis, 39%; septic arthritis, 21%; osteomyelitis, 16%; abscess, 13%; lymphadenitis, 9%; and pneumonia, 1%. Cures were achieved in all. The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Duration of therapy ranged from five to 63 days, with a mean of 15 days. The lincomycin dose ranged from 75 to 2,400 mg every six hours. The majority of patients received the drug intravenously, but 25.7% received it only intramuscularly. There were no adverse reactions at the administration sites. Only 3% of the patients developed diarrhea, which was not felt to be secondary to the drug. There were no cases of pseudomembranous colitis. Therefore parenteral lincomycin in children appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used for infections due to Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro studies of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The spectra of activity and potency of Ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. Cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. Moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against Bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. All six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group D streptococci. The action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. The only exception to this was found when large inocula of Staphylococcus aureus were tested. Increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of Ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of N-methylnitrone and nitrovinyl  derivatives of some N-substituted 2-chloroindol-3-carboxaldehydes].
AB  - N-methylnitrones and nitrovinyl derivatives from 1-substituted-2-chloroindol-3-carboxaldehydes were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity. Some nitrovinyl derivatives displayed good in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria; the compound (II e), 1-(o-chlorobenzyl)-2-chloro-3-(2-nitroethenyl)indole, was more active than nitrofurantoin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Some structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Potentiation of natural killer activity of human lymphocytes by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and its protein A.
AB  - Cytotoxic activity of human lymphocytes against the myeloid cell line K-562 was augmented greatly by 24-h incubation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I bacteria (SpA CoI) and its protein A. This effect was not observed when these stimulants were added after preincubation, suggesting that this activity was different from so-called lectin-induced cellular cytotoxicity. Potentiation required at least 12 to 18 h incubation of lymphocytes with these stimulants. Macrophage depletion did not affect the potentiation by protein A or SpA coI, although the potentiation by poly I:C or OK-432, an immunopotentiator of Streptococcus pyogenes was completely reduced. Further cell separation procedures revealed that neither T cells nor FcR- cells, which showed little natural killer (NK) activity, were enhanced by protein A or SpA coI. On the other hand, (a) null cells which were obtained from nylon column (NC)-passed fraction by depleting T cells and surface membrane Ig-positive cells, and (b) FcR+ E- cells which were obtained from NC-passed fraction by depleting FcR- cells and T cells, showed marked NK activity by themselves and were further augmented by these stimulants. FcR+ E+ cells failed to show NK activity even if they were stimulated by these stimulants. Thus, it was found that protein A and SpA CoI, as well as human interferon, could stimulate NC-non-adherent, FcR+, E- NK cells and potentiate markedly their NK activity.
TI  - The treatment of the carrier state of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  - 20 children who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. They were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9 isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). GABHS, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium sp. was reduced. Beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). These included all isolates of S. aureus (8) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 B. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 B. oralis (60%). Only one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of B. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. Follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 19 of the 20 children.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of erythromycin in the respiratory system.
AB  - In vivo and in vitro studies were carried out to assess tha levels in bronchial mucus of ampicillin, amoxycillin, bacampicillin, cefotaxime and erythromycin, and to compare their minimum bactericidal concentrations and killing rate against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. Both the percentage ratios of serum/mucus concentration peaks and of serum/mucus area under the concentration time curve values were higher for erythromycin than for the other antibiotics. Determination of the minimum bactericidal concentrations showed that the bacterial strains were sensitive to small quantities of erythromycin, and the time necessary to sterilize inocula varied from 4 to 16 hours.
TI  - Effect of extracellular serum in the stimulation of intracellular killing of streptococci by human monocytes.
AB  - This study shows that the intracellular killing of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae by human monocytes is stimulated by the extracellular presence of both heat-stable and heat-labile serum factors. A similar kind of stimulation of monocytes has been described in respect of catalase-positive microorganisms. However, killing of these bacteria is negligible in the absence of extracellular serum factors, whereas a large proportion of the ingested catalase-negative bacteria are killed in the absence of such extracellular stimuli. Monocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are unable to kill Staphylococcus aureus even in the presence of extracellular serum, killed S. pyogenes equally effectively whether serum was present or absent. This index proved to be the same as that for killing by monocytes of healthy subjects in the absence of serum. Taken together, these results indicate that catalase-negative microorganisms possess some kind of suicide mechanism that leads to the death of these bacteria after their ingestion by monocytes in the absence of an extracellular stimulus. Furthermore, the mechanism by which extracellular serum stimulates intracellular killing probably involves enzymes of the O2-dependent bactericidal mechanisms of the monocytes.
TI  - Topical and systemic antimicrobial agents in burns.
AB  - Infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in burns. Burn wound infection is defined as burn wound bacterial proliferation in a density equal to or greater than 10(5) bacteria per gram of tissue. Gram-negative bacteria, notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as staphylococci and fungal opportunists, have been identified as prominent invaders. Topical and systemic antimicrobial agents are essential adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of burn wound infection. Topical antimicrobial therapy is indicated in all hospitalized burn patients. Short-term use of systemic antimicrobials for prophylaxis and treatment is required in all moderate and major burns, specifically for early prophylaxis, perioperative prophylaxis, and clinical infection. Antimicrobial choice is based on specific patient or environmental bacteriological data.
TI  - Mediastinitis complicating cellulitis of the head and neck.
AB  - A patient with mediastinitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and/or Staphylococcus aureus responded to antibiotic therapy without surgical intervention, although fever was prolonged and recovery slow. The medical and surgical management of mediastinitis is discussed.
TI  - Studies on antimicrobial agents. 1. Synthesis and relation between the antimicrobial activities and certain physicochemical properties of some N'-(pyridinoacetyl) fatty acid hydrazides.
AB  - A new series of N'-(pyridinioacetyl)alkanoic and -benzoic acid hydrazides, as chloride salts, and some cyclic analogues produced ring closure have been synthesize and tested in a search for more effective germicides. Physicochemical parameters, such as surface tension, critical micelle concentration, and thermodynamic activity. (Ferguson values), were also determined. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were the most susceptible of the organisms tested. N'-(Pyridinoacetyl)hexadecanoic acid hydrazide exhibited the highest toxicity to Staph. aureus and fungi. The mean surface tension of the equitoxic solutions is 59.8 +/- 0.3 dyn/cm for bacteria and 51.65 +/- 0.1 dyn/cm for fungi. N'-(Pyridinoacetyl)octadecanoic acid hydrazide and N'-(pyridinoacetyl)-9-ocadecenoic acid hydrazide exhibit the highest toxicity to S. pyogenes (1.1 x 10(-6) M). The surface tension of their equitoxic solutions and their Ferguson values indicate that these compounds may act through a different mechanism.
TI  - Cellulitis: bacterial etiology, clinical features, and laboratory findings.
AB  
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative methods of studying the effect of lipids on bacteria grown on the surface of solid culture media.
AB  - New qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. The methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. Oleic and linoleic acids inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes markedly, Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition of growth of a strain of Str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. Linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. The methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in infants and children.
AB  - During a 25-year period, 57 cases of acute mastoiditis occurred in infants and young children who ranged in age from 2 months to 12 years of age. All patients had abnormalities of the tympanic membrane and most had fever and localized edema and redness of the overlying skin. Fifty per cent of the infants who were less than one year of age had swelling primarily above the involved ear pushing the pinna out and down. By contrast, older children had swelling of the skin overlying the mastoid process which produced the classical finding of an elevated earlobe. Mastoid roentgenograms were a useful adjunct to diagnosis, revealing concurrent osteomyelitis in 9 patients. A diagnosis of specific bacterial etiology was made in 80 per cent of the patients in whom cultures were performed. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were the bacteria most frequently isolated. Unusual manifestations or serious complications occurred in 53 per cent of the patients, including one death (due to meningitis). These data indicate that the frequency of serious complications from acute mastoiditis has not declined over the past 3 decades.
TI  - Preservation of bacterial L-forms by freezing.
AB  
TI  - Pediatric infectious cervical lymphadenitis.
AB  - Infectious cervical lymphadenitis is a frequently encountered problem in the pediatric population. The recent experience with infectious cervical lymphadenitis at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was reviewed. The most common etiologic agent was Staphylococcus aureus. beta-Hemolytic streptococcus and mycobacterium were found in 15% and 6% of cases respectively. Other agents included pneumococcus, cat scratch, Toxoplasma gondii, actinomycosis, and mixed bacteroides and peptostreptococcus. Most patients responded to high-dose intravenous antistaphylococcal penicillin. Needle aspiration proved successful in identifying the casual agent in a high percentage of cases. Aspiration was also beneficial in draining small abscess cavities. Surgical drainage was rarely necessary.
TI  - [Skin reactions to isolated bacterial cell wall components, bacterial peptidoglycan in particular].
AB  - To elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of bacterial-allergical diseases and of reactions provoked by bacterial test substances (e.g. the intracutaneous test), it is necessary to analyse carefully various factors involved in these reactions. To try to separate toxic from immunological reactions minute amounts of peptidoglycan in four different preparations were applied to humans by intracutaneous injections. Peptidoglycan, an immunologically well defined wall components of almost all bacteria and which is therefore ubiquitous, was isolated from staphylococci and streptococci. The skin reactions were evaluated by macroscopical, microscopical and immunohistological observations, as well as by electromicroscopy and statistical means. Several findings indicate the involvement of immunological factors in the observed skin reactions. In some cases no measurable reaction was seen, whereas in others typical skin reactions occurred. Similar reactions were produced by the antigenically related peptidoglycans isolated from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis. These reactions differed, however, from those elicited by peptidoglycan preparations from Streptococcus pyogenes type A. Patients with chronic bacterial infections and who were injected by four bacterial preparations demonstrated a significant increase in delayed hypersensitivity reaction compared with two other groups of patients (atopic patients without chronic infection). Because of the very low test dose, necrotic skin reactions, which occur in animal experiments, were not observed.
TI  - Modified rapid method of grouping beta haemolytic streptococci using sensitized protein A-containing staphylococci.
AB  
TI  - Activation of murine T-suppressor lymphocytes by group A streptococcal and staphylococcal pyurogenic exotoxins.
AB  - The effect of group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (PE) type C and staphylococcal PE on the in vitro antibody response to sheep erythrocytes was studied in cultures of mouse spleen cells. Both exotoxins suppressed the day 4 direct plaque-forming cell response when added to the cultures. The maximum suppression was obtained with 1.0 or 0.1 ng of toxin per culture, and the suppressive effect was reversed by addition of gangliosides to the cultures at the same time as the exotoxins. Preincubation of T lymphocytes for 4 days with either exotoxin resulted in the generation of a suppressor cell population, which produced dose-dependent suppression of the direct plaque-forming cell response when added to fresh sheep eyrthrocyte-activated splenocytes. The suppression obtained was not reversed by gangliosides indicating toxin carry-over was not responsible for the effect. B cells, preincubated with exotoxin, failed to suppress the direct plaque-forming cell response of fresh erythrocyte-activated spleen cells.
TI  - Transferability of macrolide, lincomycin, and streptogramin resistances between group A, B, and D streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.
TI  - Cellulitis: a prospective study.
AB  - We prospectively studied 20 children, ages 2 to 12 years, seen with cellulitis. Each child had a complete blood count, a blood culture, and a culture of an aspirate from the lesion. The age of the child, the fever, and the extent of cellulitis determined whether the child was hospitalized. Outpatient antibiotic therapy was penicillin or dicloxacillin. Four children (20%) had an infection on the upper extremity: 14 (70%), the leg; 1 (5%), the forehead; and one (5%), the periorbital area. Three children (15%) had a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm. Two were febrile. One child with a WBC count less than or equal to 15,000 cu mm was febrile. Two blood cultures (10%) were positive, both for Haemophilus influenzae. Twelve organisms were isolated from the aspirates: 8 Staphylococcus aureus (all penicillinase producing), 2 H influenzae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both children with H influenzae were febrile with WBC counts greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm. Of the 17 children (85%) treated as outpatients, all but one responded. We recommend admission and cultures of the blood and an aspirate of the lesion for all facial cellulitis and treatment with oxacillin and chloramphenicol. In a truncal or extremity cellulitis, initial therapy should be directed against S aureus. If the child is febrile or the WBC count greater than or equal to 15,000 cu mm, H influenzae is a likely pathogen and thus intravenous chloramphenicol must be used after cultures are obtained.
TI  - Septic arthritis in a Charcot joint.
AB  - Two patients with Charcot joints developed septic arthritis. The infection in the first patient was treated successfully by repeated needle aspirations and parenteral oxacillin administration. In the second patient closed drainage and parenteral penicillin were not successful in eradicating the infection, and surgical incision with suction drainage was required. Technical difficulties achieving arthrodesis in a Charcot joint suggest that repeated needle aspirations are the preferred method of initial joint drainage. Surgical drainage is advised for loculated, grossly purulent parts of the joint.
TI  - [Necrotizing fasciitis].
AB  
TI  - Treatment of cellulitis with ceforanide.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with cellulitis were treated with ceforanide, 1 g every 12 h, intramuscularly. A good clinical response was observed in 33 cases. Drug failure in the remaining two patients was thought to be due to the lack of surgical debridement. Drug concentrations well in excess of inhibitory levels for Streptococcus pyogenes were generally present throughout the treatment period; although this was not true of ceforanide concentrations relative to inhibitory levels for Staphylococcus aureus, the clinical response in patients with staphylococcal infection still appeared to be entirely satisfactory. Killing of S. pyogenes by 5, 50, and 500X the minimum inhibitory concentration of ceforanide proceeded at the same rate in vitro as did killing by 5, 50, and 500X the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin.
TI  - Biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of Propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The protection showed a biphasic pattern. The maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with P. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. The activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4 and 12. The delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. The early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin D, or cyclophosphamide. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. Total activities of acid phosphatase, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of P. acnes vaccine.
TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - Immunoglobulin E antibodies against Staphylococcus aureus cell walls in the sera  of patients with hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent staphylococcal infection.
AB  - The specificity of antistaphylococcal antibodies of the IgE class in five patients with hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent staphylococcal infection has been investigated. Purified cell walls were prepared from various staphylococcal strains, and serum immunoglobulin E binding was measured by using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Immunoglobulin E binding occurred only with cell walls from Staphylococcus aureus strains, including walls from a teichoic acid-deficient mutant. Immunoglobulin E did not bind to cell wall preparations from the coagulase-negative species S. capitis, S. sciuri subsp. lentus, S. simulans, S. xylosus, staphylococcal strains RB-11 and Armour, and from a group A streptococcus strain CS44. Since the glycan backbone and the tetrapeptide (pentapeptide) subunit of the peptidoglycan of all staphylococcal strains tested are believed to be identical, it is suggested that IgE binding is related to either the peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge or an unknown antigenic structure within the cell wall of S. aureus. The pathophysiological significance of antistaphylococcal immunoglobulin E antibodies in the disorder studied is at present unknown. The formation of immunoglobulin E antibodies to S. aureus cell wall components may be a manifestation of an aberrant immunological response to S. aureus related to the undue susceptibility to staphylococcal infections in these patients.
TI  - The aetiology of acute cervical adenitis in children: serological and bacteriological studies.
AB  - Acute cervical adenitis was investigated in 26 children over a 33-month period. Lymph nodes were aspirated and cultured to yield Staphylococcus aureus or group-A streptococci or both from 22 (84.6%) of the aspriates. Mycobacterium kansasii was isolated from one child. By combined culture and serial serological tests (antistreptolysin-O, anti-DNAase B, and anti-NADase), 50% of the cases were found to be associated with streptococcal infection. In a few children, S. aureus was the only organism recovered, and appeared to be the aetiological agent.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  - Formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. Both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. Propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. It is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. Standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. The investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. Evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. Propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.
TI  - Comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam LY127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and Serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. These strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, LY127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (HR 756), and cefoperazone (T 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the same hospital in 1979. Susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. Strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins and other effective antibiotics. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. The multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935 and cefotaxime. P. aeruginosa (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. All three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. Providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935. The three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to LY127935. None of the three new beta-lactams was active against S. faecalis. All were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Zinc tape treatment of burns infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: an experimental  study on guinea pigs.
AB  - Third-degree burns on guinea pigs were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The  wounds were treated with a zinc tape, a gauze sponge, or a plastic foil. In tissue specimens from the wounds, less growth of Pseudomonas was found in zinc tape treated wounds than in gauze- or plastic foil treated wounds. In vitro it was found that zinc oxide possesses an antibacterial effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  - Immunoglobulin production in man stimulated by an orally administered bacterial lysate.
AB  - The concentrations of secretory immunoglobulins in the saliva, and of immunoglobulin in the serum, have been measured by the radial immunodiffusion method in 12 healthy volunteers, before and after oral administration of Broncho-Vaxom which is a lysate of bacteria that usually cause infection in the upper respiratory tract. The mean concentration of secretory IgA in the saliva was increased by over 100% after the 10-day administration of the product. This increase was statistically significant between the 20th and 33rd day after the beginning of the treatment (p < 0.05). It fell to a normal level after a month in 4 subjects who received one treatment course only. In 8 subjects who received a second treatment course beginning 1 month after termination of the first course, the high concentration of IgAs in the saliva persisted for at least 3 months. A significant increase in the serum concentrations of IgG of about 50% and of IgM of at least 100% above the initial level was observed in the treated subjects in the time between day 35 and 5 months after the beginning of the experiment (p < 0.05).
TI  - Defective phagocytosis confined to Staphylococcus aureus in a female infant with  recurrent infections.
AB  - Defective chemotaxis and phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus was identified in  a female infant with marked hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent infections. Neutrophil mobilization from the marrow and marginal pool; random mobility; phagocytosis of yeast particles, latex beads and carbon particles; phagocytosis and intracellular killing capacity of Streptococcus pyogenes and E. coli; and NBT dye reduction were normal. Infiltration of neutrophils was depressed in the skin window test. The complement system and cellular immunity were intact. The patient also had a persistent EB virus infection. Defective phagocytosis limited to Staphylococcus aureus seems to be caused by an intrinsic cellular defect, such as congenital defect in neutrophil receptors for Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Bactericidal effect of oleic acid on group A streptococci: mechanism of action.
AB  - In contrast to Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, group  A streptococci are infrequently present on normal human skin, except in certain populations with endemic impetigo. This has been attributed to differences in susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of skin surface lipids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids. When an M type 6 strain group A streptococcus was exposed to 500 mug of oleic acid per ml, viable counts decreased by 4 logs in 5 min. The rank order of killing was 35 > 20 > 4 degrees C. Oleic acid did not kill a strain of S. aureus, a strain of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, or a strain of Escherichia coli, but bound rapidly to these bacteria as well as to the group A streptococcus. The loss of [(3)H]uridine from labeled oleic acid-treated group A streptococcal cells was greater than 100 times that of controls. There was no loss of [(3)H]-thymidine from group A streptococci or of [(3)H]uridine or [(3)H]thymidine from identically exposed coagulase-negative staphylococci. When [(3)H]uridine was added to group A streptococci during mid-log-phase growth, cessation of uptake occurred within 5 min of addition of 50 mug of oleic acid per ml. Electron microscopic changes seen within 5 min included condensation of the nucleoid and distortion of the streptococcal surface by numerous clumps and blebs. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, and E. coli similarly exposed showed no comparable electron microscopic changes. We propose that oleic acid kills group A streptococci by altering the integrity of the cell membrane with resulting loss of ribonucleic acid but not deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  - Value of cultures in patients with acute cellulitis.
AB  - A retrospective review of blood and wound cultures obtained from adult patients admitted for acute cellulitis revealed positive culture rates of 0.77% of 86% respectively. Organisms from wound cultures were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The majority of our patients were otherwise healthy. Our study suggests that blood cultures are not necessary in acute cellulitis in adults without serious underlying diseases.
TI  - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of serious infections  in children.
AB  - Intravenous TMP-SMZ was used to treat 19 infectious episodes in 18 patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 13 years. Thirteen patients with various soft tissue or skeletal infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, or Acinetobacter anitratus were successfully treated. Three children with four episodes of CSF shunt infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci were treated successfully also. The only treatment failures were in two newborn infants with enteric gram-negative bacterial ventriculitis. TMP-SMZ was given at a daily dose of 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, every six hours. The drug was administered intravenously for a mean duration of 10 days (range 4 to 32); in 11 patients this was followed by oral administration for a mean of nine days (range 2 to 18). Half-life of TMP after intravenous administration was 5 1/4 hours; that of SMA was 8 1/2 hours. Levels determined three to four days after starting therapy were generally higher than levels obtained at corresponding times after the first dose. CSF/blood TMP and SMA ratios, determined in four patients, were 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. Side effects were observed in 14 patients, and neutropenia was the most common adverse reaction. Intravenous TMP-SMZ is an effective antimicrobic agent in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms. The frequent side effects, although reversible and of no major clinical consequence, suggest that future use of TMP-SMZ should be monitored closely.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - 3-[(1,2,3-Thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins.
AB  - The syntheses of ten 3-](1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins, made by displacement of the 3'-acetoxy group by the novel thiol derivatives, potassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-thiolate and dipotassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-4-carboxylate-5-thiolate, are described. Several of the compounds showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The subcutaneous in vivo activities against Staphylococcus aureus were generally less than that of cafazolin. Four of the compounds were administered orally and all were active; the 7 beta-(thiophen-2-acetamido) and 7 beta-(D-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl] compounds were equally active by either route, with a PD50 of ca. 1 mg/kg.
TI  - Nonspecific T-lymphocyte mitogenesis by pyrogenic exotoxins from group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins types A, B, and C and staphylococcal pyrogenic exotoxin were shown to be potent nonspecific T-lymphocyte mitogens. Adherent cell populations did not significantly affect the nonspecific mitogenicity.
TI  - Effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. XIII. Role played by leukocyte extracts, lysolecithin, phospholipase a2, lysozyme, cationic proteins, and detergents in the solubilization of lipids from Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci: relation to bactericidal and bacteriolytic reactions in inflammatory sites.
AB  - The bactericidal and bacteriolytic effects of lysolecithin (LL) and egg-white lysozyme (LYZ) on Staph. aureus and group A streptococci and the solubilization of phospholipids from the bacterial membranes by these agents was studied. Low concentrations of lysolecithin (1--10 microgrames/ml) are highly bactericidal for Steph. aureus and group A streptococci, but induce neither bacteriolysis nor solubilization of a substantial amount of membrane phospholipids. On the other hand, while LL at greater than 50 micrograms/ml causes substantial lipid release, a combination of LL and LYZ is absolutely needed to solubilize lipids from streptococci. This combination is, however, not bacteriolytic for this microrganism. The solubilization of lipids from staphylococci by LL is much faster than that induced in streptococci by LL + LYZ. The solubilization of the bulk of membrane lipids from staphylococci can also be achieved by Triton X-100 and by sodium lauryl sulfate and from group A streptococci by Triton X-100 plus LYZ. A variety of other detergents (e.g., Cetavlon, sodium taurocholate, cetyl pyrdinium chloride) have no lipid-releasing properties even in the presence of LYZ. The release of lipids by LYZ (in the presence of LL) from group A streptococci is related to its enzymatic activity, on a still unknown substrate, but not to its cationic nature as this muramidase cannot be replaced by a variety of cation substances (histone, polylysin, leukocyte cationic proteins, polymyxin B, and spermidine). The release of lipids from staphylococci by LL is not inhibited by a variety of anionic and cationic polyelectrocytes (heparin, liquoid, chondroitin sulfate, DNA histone, and polylysine) which markedly inhibit the release of lipids from group A streptococci by LL and LYZ. Streptococci that had been cultivated in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin G lose their membrane phospholipids to a larger extent and by much smaller concentrations of LL and LYZ, as compared to controls, suggesting that the interference with the synthesis of the peptidoglycan increases the accessibility of the cell membrane to the lipid-releasing agents. The mechanism by which LL collaborates with LYZ in lipid release is still not known. The possible role of bacterial lipids and lyso compounds in the control of bacterial survival in inflammatory sites is briefly discussed.

TI  - Bacterial tracheitis.
AB  - During a 14-month period, eight infants and children were observed with an acute, infectious, upper airway obstructive disease with features common to both croup and epiglottitis. We have termed this distinct entity "bacterial tracheitis." All patients failed to respond to treatment for croup, including racemic epinephrine delivered by intermittent positive-pressure breathing. Direct laryngoscopy consistently revealed a normal epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds but marked subglottic mucosal edema. Tracheal suctioning yielded copius mucopus below the subglottic swelling. Gram stain of this material corroborated subsequent cultures: Staphylococcus aureus, six; group A Streptococcus, one; and Haemophilus influenzae (not typed), one. All patients required periodic tracheal suctioning for relief of upper airway obstruction. Six patients required endotracheal intubation; one required a tracheostomy. Bacterial tracheitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a young child with a croup-like illness that is refractory to conventional therapy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - Specific absorption of human serum albumin, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin  G with selected strains of group A and G streptococci.
AB  - Five gram-positive bacterial strains were selected for absorption studies of human serum samples. Strain AR1 (group A, M-type 1) and G148 (group G), with strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding capacities, and strain AW43 (group A, M-type 60), binding both IgA1 and IgA2, were compared with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and with Staphylococcus epidermidis L603. Both AR1 and G148 were capable of completely absorbing out serum IgG. In contrast, S. aureus Cowan I left a fraction unabsorbed, as expected from its known lack of IgG3 binding. Strain AW43 absorbed out all serum IgA, using a 10-microliter bacterial pellet for 20 microliter of serum. Serum IgM levels were slightly reduced by S. aureus Cowan I absorption. On the basis of the experiments, a bacterial mixture was designed consisting of S. aureus Cowan I and group A streptococcus strains AR1 and AW43, with absorption characteristics suitable for use in discriminating between early IgM and late IgG and IgA immune responses in routine serological work. A new type of bacteria-mammalian protein binding was discovered. Human serum albumin was completely absorbed out by strain G148 and to a lesser extent by strain AR1 and AW43. S. aureus Cowan I and S. epidermidis were negative. The binding capacity of G148 for albumin equalled that of Cowan I for IgG. The binding pattern of albumin to the strains was different from those of IgG, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, or aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and therefore seems to represent another type of bacterial-mammalian interaction with a specific albumin receptor on the surface of streptococci.

AB  - The susceptibility of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae) frequently occurring in outpatients (treated by practitioners) to six kinds of antibiotics [ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), erythromycin (EM), minocycline (MNC), gentamicin (GM) and thiamphenicol (TP)] was determined by the standard method established by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. 1) There were few multiple-antibiotic-resistant urine isolates from patients with a simple urinary tract infection, whereas urine isolates from patients with a complicated urinary tract infection contained many multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 2) Isolates from patients with a respiratory tract infection (sputum and tonsillar secretions isolates) and isolates from patients with acute purulent otitis media (purulent discharge isolates) contained few multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms except for EM-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. 3) Superficial pus isolates contained many multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms, while bile isolates were relatively free from multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 4) When the results of the previous8,9) and present investigations were compared with the reports of other Japanese investigators1,5,6), suggestive evidence was provided that organisms resistant to macrolides and chloramphenicol showed a tendency to decrease, whereas organisms resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics were on the increase.

TI  - Attempts to control clothes-borne infection in a burn unit, 2. Clothing routines  in clinical use and the epidemiology of cross-colonization.
AB  - Previous investigations have shown that cross-contamination in a burn unit is mainly clothes-borne. New barrier garments have been designed and tried experimentally. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different clothing routines on cross-contamination. In a long-term study, the rates and routes of colonizations with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined. The exogenous colonization rates were, with S. aureus 77%, with Streptococcus species 52% and with Ps. aeruginosa 32%. The colonization rate with Ps. aeruginosa was higher in patients with larger burns. Patients dispersed Streptococcus and Ps. aeruginosa as well as S. aureus into the air of their rooms in considerable amounts, but dispersers were not more important as sources of cross-colonization than non-dispersers. In comparison of clothing routines, there was no difference in overall colonization rates. The newly designed barrier garment that was made from apparently particle-tight material did not reduce the transfer of bacteria from patient to patient. A less rigid routine than that previously used did not increase the risk of cross-contamination. A thorough change of barrier dress after close contact nursing delayed the first exogenous S. aureus colonization from day 6 to day 14 after admission. This routine might be recommended for clinical use. Otherwise, methods must be developed for adequate selection of materials intended for barrier garments.
TI  - The microbiology of serous and mucoid otitis media.
AB  - One hundred forty-four serous and mucoid effusions were cultured for aerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and virus. Thirty percent of all effusions yielded an unequivocally positive culture for aerobic bacteria. Although serous effusions were culture positive as often as mucoid effusions, Haemophilus influenzae was isolated predominantly from serous effusions and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominantly from mucoid samples. Only one of 73 effusions yielded a viral isolate (Herpesvirus hominis). None of 33 effusions yielded M pneumoniae, and only one of 17 effusions yielded an anaerobe (Propionibacterium). These findings suggest that aerobic bacteria may play a role in the pathogensis of serous and mucoid otitis media.
TI  - The nasopharyngeal culture in acute otitis media. A reappraisal of its usefulness.
AB  - Simultaneous cultures of the nasopharynx and middle ear exudate (obtained by tympanocentesis) were obtained from 225 children (mean age, 34 months; median age, 41 months) with suppurative otitis media. A 72% prediction rate for middle ear pathogens was obtained by examining the nasopharyngeal cultures after the strict observance of two essential prerequisites: (1) the nasopharyngeal culture was immediately plated on appropriate solid agar and (2) a semiquantitative method for bacterial enumeration was employed in the reading of the nasopharyngeal culture plates. The technique was most valuable where 2+ (greater than 25% up to 50% of total number of colonies was a single pathogen) or greater of a single pathogen was recovered from the nasopharynx. In only one instance, the semiquantitative nasopharyngeal culture incorrectly predicted the middle ear pathogen if one was recovered. Quantitative nasopharyngeal cultures were particularly useful in predicting the presence of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci as causative agents in otitis media.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Epidemiologic studies among Amerindian populations of Amazonia. I. Pyoderma: prevalence and associated pathogens.
AB  - Pyoderma was studied among a representative sample of the residents of four remote Amerindian villages, Amazonas State, Brazil, during July-August 1976. The overall prevalence among the 775 inhabitants examined was 11%, with little intervillage variation. When the attack rates for the entire sample population were calculated by 5-year age intervals, the 0- to 4-year-olds had the highest rate, 31%. The highest prevalence, 38%, was found among 3-year-olds. Attack rates were not apparently related to sex. Cultures which were taken from representative pyoderma lesions from people in the four survey villages and from three additional villages were studied by a modified delayed culture technique for recovery of gram-positive pathogens from silica-gel desiccated swabs. Group A and group G B-hemolytic streptococci, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae were isolated. Group A S. pyogenes was most commonly found, occasionally as the sole pathogenic species. No nephritogenic M-types were found, although most isolates were not M-typable. The T-types found corresponded to those previously reported as being pyoderma-associated. Most pyoderma-associated C. diphtheriae isolates were non-toxigenic. Biotypes gravis and mitis were equally represented.
TI  - Thienamycin: new beta-lactam antibiotic with potent broad-spectrum activity.
AB  - Thienamycin, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, exhibited potent, broad-spectrum activity in vitro against gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, including many isolates resistant to currently available antibiotics. All isolates were inhibited at concentrations less than or equal to 25 mug/ml, with the exception of 12% of isolates of Enterobacter spp. and 3% of isolates of Serratia marcescens. Its activity decreased with an increase in inoculum concentration of from 10(5) to 10(7) cells per ml.

AB  
TI  - Staphylococcal and streptococcal infections of the skin.
AB  - Acute pyogenic infections of the skin, caused by hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus, account for the vast majority of bacterial infections of the skin seen in ambulatory practice. In preschool children the principal manifestation is pyoderma, which is usually caused by Group A Streptococcus. In this age group pyoderma regularly responds to systemic penicillin therapy plus adjunctive local care to the lesions. However, in older age groups, the ability to distinguish streptococcal from staphylococcal skin infections on the basis of clinical features alone is poor, and penicillin treatment failures are more common. Safe, effective antibiotics that are effective against both staphylococci and streptococci are readily available. For this reason penicillinase-resistant semisynthtic penicillins and or erythromycin can be used to treat acute pyogenic skin infections in older age groups.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - Factors causing the clumping reaction of streptococcal strains with human plasma.
AB  - Fresh isolates of 204 strains of Streptococcus haemolyticus, 75 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and 45 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their clumping reactions with human plasma. The plasma and serum factors that clumped the streptococcal strains were compared with those that clumped a Staphylococcus aureus strain. One hundred eleven strains of S. haemolyticus, 10 strains of viridans group Streptococcus, and none of the strains of S. pneumoniae tested were clumped by human plasma. However, clumping activity was remarkably unstable after subculturing on plates containing Todd-Hewitt blood agar. The strain with the highest level of activity was clumped by fibrinogen and normal human serum. Results of tests of the clumping reactions of staphylococci and streptococci with human serum indicated that the serum factors responsible for those reactions may be identical.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Eighty-one adults with symptoms of acute sinusitis were studied by direct needle  puncture and aspiration of the maxillary sinus (105 sinuses). Fifty-nine bacterial strains were isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 64% of the isolates. Other bacteria recovered included anaerobes (12%), Neisseria species (8.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), non-group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), and Escherichia coli (2%). Viruses were isolated from 11 sinuses; these isolates included rhinovirus (six), influenza A (H3N2) virus (three), and two types of parainfluenza virus (one each). The efficacy of therapy with orally administered ampicillin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by a repeat sinus puncture and culture. Clinical and bacteriologic responses to all three regimens were good.
TI  - Studies on the inhibitory effects of zinc heptanoate on microorganisms.
AB  - Inhibitory effect of zinc heptanoate was observed on different cultures of bacteria and fungi. Growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by the compound. Greatest inhibition was seen in the case of Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, Vibrio cholerae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and E. coli whereas least inhibition was found in the case of Staphylococcus aureus. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was least for Klebsiella pneumoniae (800 p.p.m.) while in the case of Staph. aureus and Bacillus subtilis it was 200 p.p.m. Among yeasts and fungi greatest inhibition was found with Trichophyton schoenleini, T. rubrum, T. gourvili, Microsporum adouini, M. vanbreuseghemi and least in the case of Candida albicans. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution the MIC for T. schoenleini and T. gourvili and T. violaceum was as low as 900 p.p.m. whereas in the case of Aspergillus oryzae it was highest--3500 p.p.m. The effect of the compound on glucose consumption of Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis was also seen.

TI  - The recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  - Experiments with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. No such recovery period was observed, however, when Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. Microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of S. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. However, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. In the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.
TI  - [Therapy of chronic respiratory tract infections in children, including mucoviscidosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In respiratory tract infections in children a distinction must be made between frequently recurring infections and genuine chronic infections due to specific anatomical factors, immunological defects or congenital diseases such as mucoviscidosis. The most frequent pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella, S. aureus predominates in infants. The same applies for mucoviscidosis, in which P. aeruginosa is the second most frequent pathogen, occurring frequently after a primary infection with staphylococci. In order to avoid frequent relapses in mucoviscidosis patients, uninterrupted long-term treatment with an antibiotic which is effective against staphylococci is recommended, commencing the moment the diagnosis has been established. Suitable antibiotics are co-trimoxazole or oral cephalosporins (e. g. cephalexin, cephradine or cefaclor). Other respiratory tract infections should be treated according to the antibiogramme with a suitable antibiotic once the diagnosis has been confirmed.
TI  - Influence of lipids from Listeria monocytogenes on the course of infections due to some gram-positive bacteria in mice.
AB  - The influence of lipids from Listeria monocytogenes on the course of infections due to some gram-positive cocci Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus and L. monocytogenes was studied in white mice. Varying doses of the lipid preparation were administered before infection. Mortality of the animals and rate of elimination of the bacteria from the organs and blood circulation were recorded. In appropriate doses, the lipids markedly enhanced resistance to the aforementioned bacteria. Mortality was substantially reduced, and elimination of the infectious agent from tissues and blood was significantly accelerated.

TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Comparative study of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin antimicrobial activity against human respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - An in vitro test system was used to compare the antimicrobial activity of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin against respiratory tract pathogens isolated from man. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fresh clinical isolates of Streptoccus pyogenes, Streptocuccus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae to the macrolide and penicillins ranged between 0.01 and 0.9 microgram/ml. The microbes were exposed to each antibiotic for approximately 3 h at 1x,2x and 5x the relevant MIC. Irreversible surface defects and intracellular lesions were resolved by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in all antibiotic-treated bacterial species, irrespective of the antimicrobial used. In each case, inhibition of growth was recorded by turbometric assay; no significant difference was observed among the declining slopes of post-dosing growth curves for either erythromycin-, amoxicillin- or ampicillin-treated pathogens. The experimental observations show that the onset of antimicrobial activity and the bactericidal effectiveness of equipotent concentrations of erythromycin, amoxicillin and ampicillin were comparable in this study. The results complement previous clinical, bacteriologic and ultrastructure studies in vivo and demonstrate the contribution of the combined in vivo/in vitro study design for better understanding of antimicrobial activity in human respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Aetiologic agents of septic sore throat in Thai children.
AB  - A bacteriological study of children with respiratory infections in Bangkok during January to November 1976 revealed that 37% of the patients had symptoms and sign of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. Twenty-six per cent of these children harboured Streptococcus pyogenes in their throats. The numbers of streptococci other than group A and Staphylococcus aureus were increased in the children with respiratory infections. However, Staph. aureus was found as the sole organism in children with exudate more often than in the children with only URI. The possible role of Staph. aureus in bacterial pharyngitis should not be ignored. Penicillin remains a drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. If penicillin is contraindicated, erythromycin should be preferred over lincomycin as a second choice of drug in order to avoid treatment failure if lincomycin resistant streptococci are present.
TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
TI  - In vivo activity of amoxicillin and ampicillin against gram-positive bacteria: results of prophylactic studies.
AB  - In prophylactic treatment of intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (types 1 and 2) and Streptococcus pyogenes in mice, amoxicillin had a definite advantage over ampicillin in terms of protective effect. When the infecting agent was given to mice so as to produce an infection in the brain or lung (for example, S. pneumoniae given intracranially or intranasally), amoxicillin was also more effective prophylactically than ampicillin.
TI  - Septic bursitis.
AB  - In 12 cases of septic bursitis seen during 11 years, 11 patients were men and one patient was a woman, with a mean age of 51.3 years. The olecranon bursa was involved in nine cases. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from nine of ten culture-positive fluids. Bursal fluid WBC counts ranged from 1,550/cu mm to 165,000/cu mm, associated with low glucose levels in two cases, but not in three. Treatment with antibiotics and needle aspiration or surgical drainage was successful.

TI  - Quantitative studies on competitive activities of skin bacteria growing on solid  media.
AB  - Earlier quantitative investigations of antagonism between skin bacteria were based on the use of liquid cultures, but a more realistic model has now been devised, based on the use of the surfaces of solid media. Pure or mixed inocula were spread evenly over suitable agar media in Petri dishes marked out with a standard grid. Growth curves were constructed from viable counts of the surface bacteria after they had been removed from excised squares of the agar media and dispersed. The method was highly reproducible, and competitive interactions were revealed more clearly than in studies with liquid media. An antibiotic-producing strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S6+) readily suppressed strains of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium and Streptococcus species. However, a Staphylococcus aureus strain which was less sensitive to the antibiotic effect of S6+ interacted in a complex manner, depending on the absolute and relative size of the S6+ inoculum.
TI  - Pyridoxine inhibition of a symbiotic streptococcus.
AB  - A symbiotic, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus that showed satellitism about a Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from blood cultures of a patient with endocarditis. Previously reported as being required for growth of symbiotic streptococci, pyridoxine hydrochloride was found to inhibit the growth of this organism.
TI  - Treatment of impetigo and ecthyma.
AB  - A comparison of the treatment of superficial skin infections using intramuscular  benzathine penicillin G alone or combined with hexachlorophene scrubbing was conducted in 127 children. Of 72 children treated with benzathine penicillin alone, 94.4 percent had a good result. Of the 55 children receiving hexachlorophene scrubbing in addition to penicillin, 85.5 percent had a good result. The healing rate was higher (93 percent) in those children whose skin cultures grew Group A beta hemolytic streptococci. When staphylococcus aureus was the only pathogen isolated, the healing rate was 86 percent. Regardless of the pathogens isolated, the healing rate was not increased with scrubbing. Since scrubbing with hexachlorophene offered no improvement in the healing rate and since it adds to the expense and discomfort of treatment, it should be eliminated as part of the treatment.
TI  - Rationale for topical antibiotics.
AB  - Topical antibiotics are under attack by critics who claim that no proof of efficacy exists and that systemic administration is far more effective. In this paper, we review the existing evidence and conclude that topical antibiotics have a place in the prevention and treatment of superficial skin infections. Our own experimental studies showed that topical antibiotics promptly reduce the density of Staphylococcus aureus in secondarily infected chronic dermatoses, associated with clinical improvement. In addition, topical antibiotics were shown to be highly effective in preventing and suppressing experimental S. aureus infections in human volunteers.
TI  - [Restriction of washing and its effect to the normal human skin flora. Quantitative and qualitative investigations of the aerobic skin flora (author's transl)].
AB  - The behaviour of the aerobic skin flora of the flexor sides of the forearms, under a three-week restriction of washing, was investigated in twenty-four patients for its quantitative and qualitative aspects. The combined scrabbing-washing method was used as described by Burtenshaw with Ringer's solution. After a three-week restriction of washing, using the Wilcoxon Test, statistically no significant changes in the total number of microorganisms were found in areas investigated in the intermittent sampling of the skin flora. A three-week restriction of washing in the region of the flexor sides of the forearms does not induce significant changes in the composition of the normal aerobic skin flora. The percentage of differences in the total number of bacteria fluctuates up to the mark in wide limits; statements about standard deviations are not permitted because of the technical and experimental conditions. There was no shifting of the Resident flora to other groups of bacteria in the patients under study. Pathogenic microorganisms could not be found in higher numbers after the second sampling.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new 2-nitroimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In an earlier paper we described the synthesis and the antitrichomonas activity of 2-nitro-alpha,alpha,1-trimethyl-1H-imidazole-5-methanol (2). Starting from this compound, several derivatives have been synthesized. Among these, the phenyl carbonate 8 has been shown to possess activity equal to that of 2 and to be less toxic. This compound therefore is interesting in comparison with some antitrichomonas agents currently in use clinically. Before undertaking an in-depth investigation, compound 8 was subjected to some studies to see whether it has any effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Preliminary results show that, at therapeutic doses, it might induce unwanted CNS effects to a lesser degree than metronidazole.
TI  - Bacteria induce lymphokine synthesis polyclonally in human B lymphocytes.
AB  - We have studied the ability of various bacteria to stimulate human lymphocytes to produce leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LIF). Mononuclear cells from adult and cord blood as well as purified T and B lymphocytes were stimulated with killed bacteria. The culture supernatants were tested for the presence of LIF by the agarose migration method. All nine bacterial strains tested activated unseparated mononuclear cells and B lymphocytes but not T cells to produce LIF. LIF was also present in cord blood cell cultures suggesting that the stimulation of lymphocytes was polyclonal rather than antigenic. Therefore, we propose that one of the physiologic functions of B lymphocyte lymphokines might be to form part of the nonspecific defense mechanisms against microbial invasion.
TI  - Cervicofacial abcesses of unknown origin. A survey of eighty-one cases.
AB  - A survey of eighty-one patients with cervicofacial abscesses of unknown origin is presented. The salient clinical features and the treatment of the abscesses are described. Mainly affected were children under 4 years of age, and the submandibular and submental regions were the most common sites of involvement. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogenic organism, and epidemic strains were implicated in some cases. A high incidence of resistance to penicillin was noted. The nasal vestibule is postulated to be reservoir of the organisms, and the possible relationship between infection, malnutrition, and a mild degree of anemia is examined.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory investigation of cefamandole in infections of infants and children.
AB  - Forty-seven infants and children with a variety of infections including bacteremia, ethmoiditis, and periorbital cellulitis, soft tissue infection, pneumonia, and lymphadenitis were treated with intravenous cefamandole. The infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The clinical response was prompt, and, with the exception of two cases who developed skin rash, significant side effects were not noted. In vitro cefamandole was very effective in inhibiting the growth of H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory investigation of cefamandole therapy of infections in infants and children.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate was effective in the treatment of a variety of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae in infants and children. The infections included periorbital cellulitis and ethmoiditis, bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, and lymphadenitis. In vitro, cefamandole was effective in inhibiting the growth of H. influenzae isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis or sepsis. In two patients rash developed and cefamandole was discontinued. Other significant adverse effects were not noted.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory evaluation of cefamandole in infants and children.
AB  - Fifty-three infants and children, aged three months to 15 years, were treated with an average daily dose of 100 mg of cefamandole/kg intravenously. Of these patients, 47 had soft tissue cellulitis and six had pneumonia. Primary pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 43 of the 53 patients. Bacteremia was documented in six of the 53 patients. A satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic response to cefamandole was achieved in all cases except on (98%). The only treatment failure occurred in an infant with both periorbital cellulitis and bacteremia due to H. influenzae who developed meningitis while receiving cefamandole; no extravasation of the drug across the blood-brain barrier could be detected in spite of inflamed meninges. In general, the only aberrant effects of cefamandole were the appearance of eosinophilia in 28% of patients and a positive indirect Cooms' test without hemolysis in one patient. Cefamandole showed excellent in vitro activity against 87 ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae. Because it has greater activity than any of the other cephalosporins against this important pediatric pathogen, cefamandole may have particular pertinence in the treatment of infections in infants and young children.
TI  - Interpatient microbiological cross-contamination after dental radiographic examination.
AB  - Pairs of patients were evaluated for microbiological cross-contamination after radiographic examination. In 30 of these pairs of patients there was the possibility of transference of S pyogenes, S aureus, or D pneumoniae. Such transference was observed in 23 (77%) of these 30 pairs of patients. The vectors for such transfer include the hands of the X-ray technician and the radiographic equipment. Further, it was found that each of these organisms would survive for at least 48 hours after being placed on an X-ray tube. Since interpatient microbiological cross-contamination can occur after routine radiographic examination, in some cases, disinfection of the radiographic equipment is indicated.

TI  - Oral antibiotic therapy for skeletal infections of children. II. Therapy of osteomyelitis and suppurative arthritis.
AB  - Antimicrobial regimens consisting of a brief initial period of parenteral therapy followed by oral therapy were investigated in infants and children with suppurative bone and joint disease. There were 30 patients with acute hematogenous disease (19 osteomyelitis; three osteoarthritis; eight arthritis) and five with subacute or chronic osteomyelitis. Disease was due to Staphylococcus aureus in 26, Hemophilus influenzae in five, streptococci in three, and S. aureus plus Streptococcus pyogenes in one patient. Pus was removed by surgical drainage or needle aspiration. Oral therapy was monitored by assay of antibiotic concentration and bactericidal activity in serum. Adjustments in dosage were made when necessary to assure a peak serum bactericidal titer of at least 1:8. One patient progressed to chronic osteomyelitis but all other patients with acute disease responded well. Oral therapy provides increased patient comfort and decreases the risk of nosocomial infection associated with prolonged intravenous therapy. It should be carried out only under carefully monitored conditions in hospital to assure compliance and adequacy of serum bactericidal activity.
TI  - Changing ecology of acute bacterial empyema: occurrence and mortality at Boston City Hospital during 12 selected years from 1935 to 1972.
AB  - The occurrence, etiology, and demography of acute bacterial empyema are presented to reflect the widespread use of sulfonamides, penicillin, and other active antibiotics. In community-acquired (C-A) cases Streptococcus pneumoniae, hemolytic streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent single organisms identified in initial positive cultures of pleural fluid during 1935. S. pneumoniae declined steadily until 1953 but continued to occur frequently in C-A cases. Hemolytic streptococci became infrequent. S. aureus increased and became the most frequent organism in 1955 and declined to original levels after 1965 while gram-negative rods increased. S. aureus, aerobic gram-negative rods, and enterococci were most frequent in originally mixed infections, hospital-acquired cases, and superinfections. Anaerobes with or without aerobes were mostly seen in C-A cases and did not vary in incidence. Mortality increased with age. Overall mortality was greater during the 10 antibiotic years, associated with a marked decrease in the proportion of patients younger than 50 years and increase in those over 60 years old, and was greater in patients with serious underlying diseases subjected to more complicated surgical procedures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibacterials. 6. Synthesis of sisomicin, Antibiotic G-52, and novel 6'-substituted analogues of sisomicin from aminoglycoside 66-40C.
AB  - The discovery of aminoglycoside 66-40C, a novel dimeric, unsaturated imine produced by Micromonospora inyoensis, afforded a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of a variety of sisomicin analogues modified at the 6' position. The conversion of 66-40C into sisomicin, antibiotic G-52, and a series of novel 6'-substituted analogues of sisomicin is described, and the biological activity of the products is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sisomicin.
AB  - A study of the in vitro antibacterial activity of a new aminoglycoside, sisomicin, is reported. The results show no significant differences between the activity of sisomicin and gentamicin.
TI  - Hemolytic streptococci among infants in a maternity department. Report of an outbreak.
AB  - Reports of several streptococcal infections among babies after discharge from a maternity department initiated an epidemiologic study. Out of 100 infants in the 3 maternity wards 67% were colonized on the umbilicus with hemolytic streptococci group A. It was assumed that the spread had occurred from infant to infant in connection with the nursing. By means of new and strict hygienic routines, isolation and penicillin treatment of the colonized infants the spread was rapidly brought to an end. A retrospective study among the children delivered up to 6 weeks earlier showed that no less than 64% had had clinical signs of infection of possible streptococcal origin. Infections had also occurred among many family members. The observations emphasize the importance of strict hygienic routines and continuous bacteriologic surveillance in maternity departments, as well as close contact between maternity departments and health centers for children.
TI  - Biological characteristics of peptidoglycans of group A streptococcus and some other bacterial species. II. Immunological mechanisms involved in thrombocytolysis.
AB  - Immunological mechanisms are involved in the thrombocytolytic activity of peptidoglycan of Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Inactivation of particular components of complement (heating of blood serum to 56 degrees C,incubation with zymosan or NH4OH) inhibited the thrombocytolytic activity of group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. So did preincubation of Group A streptococcus peptidoglycan with homologous antipeptidoglycan antibody. On the other hand, antibody to Group A streptococcus peptidoglycan did not inhibit the thrombocytolytic effect of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan. Human platelets are resistant to peptidoglycans. They remain resistant in the presence of rabbit serum although rabbit platelets are highly sensitive to peptidoglycans. This suggests that, for the expression of the thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycan, specific receptors on the surface of platelets must be present in addition to serum factors.
TI  - Cellular immunity to bacteria: impairment of in vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Lymphocyte responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A and to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated in patients with cystic fibrosis and in normal individuals. Lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was stimulated by gentamicin-killed whole bacteria, and the proliferative response was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The in vitro lymphocyte responses to antibiotic-killed bacterial reached maximum thymidine incorporation after 5 days in culture and followed a unimodal dose-response curve for each of the bacteria studied. A significant specific incapacity to respond to P. aeruginosa was detected in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced clinical disease.
TI  - Structure-activity correlations for antibacterial 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives  on gram-positive cells.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a set of 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives against Staph, aureus and Strep, pyogenes has been correlated with structural features of the compounds examined. It is shown by means of substituent constants and regression analysis that the lipophilic character of the molecule is the most important factor in determining its activity. Electronic and steric effects appear to be quite important.

TI  - Antimicrobial lipids: natural and synthetic fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - Over 40 natural or synthetic lipophilic compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity. Gram (+) bacteria and yeasts but not Gram (-) bacteria were affected by these agents. Epimino and selena fatty acids are more active than their corresponding straight chain unsubstituted fatty acids. The position of selenium influenced the antimicrobial activity of the fatty acids. The presence and position of a double or triple bond, usually an important factor in long chain fatty acids (greater than C14) had little or no effect in C11 fatty acids. Optimum antimicrobial activity was found for fatty acids and their corresponding monoglycerides when the chain lenght was C12. The dilaurin derivative was not active.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - Heterogeneity of nonimmune immunoglobulin Fc reactivity among gram-positive cocci: description of three major types of receptors for human immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty strains of various gram-positive cocci were tested for quantitative, nonimmune binding of radiolabeled human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG). The majority of coagulase-positive staphylococci and streptococci belonging to serogroups C and G showed a high uptake of IgG. The binding of immunoglobulin to group A streptococci was considerably less, with a number of strains completely negative. None of the pneumococcal or the group B or D streptococcal strains displayed any binding capacity. Heterogeneity of the IgG reactivity of various reactive strains was studied in an inhibition assay using 10 different animal serum pools. Three different inhibition patterns were seen, each of them revealing a striking degree of homogeneity within single bacterial species. Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci, respectively, constituted two homogeneous groups which differed markedly from each other and from C and G streptococci. No differences were observed between group C and G streptococci. Based on the profound differences between these homogeneous groups, three major types of Fc receptors could be defined. Type I and II Fc receptors were found on S. aureus and on group A streptococci, respectively. Fc receptor type III represented the immunoglobulin-binding structure of both group C and G streptococci.

AB  - The authors studied stable L-cultures of Proteus valgaris, Bac. subtillis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes of group A, and also unstable cultures of the L-forms of Proteus vulgaris and Proteus vulgaris culture at the stage of spheroplasts. Spheroid cells proved to appear at the stage of spheroplasts, prevailed at the log phase in stable and unstable L-cultures, but were less frequent at the stationary phase. Cross section of L-colonies showed that they were located at the surface. The size of spheroid elements was from 1 to 5 micron; their surface was smooth or slightly wrinkled with numerous protrusions and individual sockets. The spheroid cells were distributed in the colonies freely, in clusters, or were connected to one another by anastomosis. Several methods of reproduction of spheroid cells are described, including equal and unequal binary fission, budding, and formation of elementary bodies within the cell. Morphological connection of spheroid cells with large bodies, filamentous structures and structureless matrix of the L-colony apparently pointed to their origin from the corresponding elements of the L-cultures.

The degree of erythrocytolysis dispension of the tonsillar cells and their treatment with antiglobulin serum.
TI  - Bacteriology of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Sixteen patients with necrotizing fasciitis were observed under clinical and laboratory conditions for collection, preservation, and culture that permitted optimal retrieval of anaerobes. The clinical observations of necrosis of fascia, subcutaneous fat and skin with thrombosis of the microvasculature, and absence of myonecrosis were clearly apparent in these patients. Two clear-cut groups of culture and gram stain results were found, suggesting that the clinical entity of necrotizing fasciitis can occur after infection by different infecting organisms. The cultivation of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), either alone or in combination with staphylococcus, in three patients conforms to the culture results found by Meleney [1] in his original description.

AB  - (1) The antibacterial acivity of ciclacillin (ACPC) with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml was four times less potent than that of ampicillin (ABPC) and 4 approximately 8 times less potent than that of AMPC, but was 4 approximately 8 times more potent than that of CEX against Streptococcus pyogenes. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, ACPC was 2 approximately 4 times less active than ABPC and AMPC, but 16 approximately 32 times more active than CEX. Staphylococcus aureus was 4 approximately 8 times less susceptible to ACPC than to ABPC and AMPC, but 1 approximately 2 times more susceptible than to CEX. Against E. coli, ACPC was as active as CEX, 2 approximately 4 times less active than ABPC, and 4 approximately 8 times less active than AMPC. (2) It was suposed that ACPC was more resistant to penicillinase and more antibacterial with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml cells/ml than with 10(6) cells/ml. ACPC was 4 approximately 8 times less active than ABPC, and AMPC against Staphylococcus aureus with 10(8) cells/ml, while with 10(6) cells/ml, it was 2 times less active than ABPC and AMPC. (3) ACPC-resistant strains (greater than or equal to 3.13 microng/ml) of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were not found. (4) A difference was noted in MIC of three semi-synthetic penicillins, ACPC, ABPC and AMPC, against Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli between the sources from which their strains were isolated. (5) There were many strains resistant to erythromycin (EM) and josamycin (JM) (greater than 60%, respectively to both antibiotics) in Stretpococcus pyogenes and pus-isolated Staphylococcus aureus. No strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, were found resistant to EM and JM.
TI  - Chemotherapy of acute bone and joint infections.
AB  - A series of 72 cases of acute osteomyelitis and acute septic arthritis has been presented. Operative intervention was necessary in 71% of our cases. All patients were treated with antibiotics. The initial antibiotic treatment in 39% of the cases was a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). This combination gave the lowest average time for subsidence of general symptoms and local signs. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in 87% of our cases. Streptococcus pyogenes and Pneumococcus were the other causative organisms. Over half of the S. aureus infections were resistant to penicillin but none were resistant to TMP/SMX. Considering the low toxicity, good clinical response, lack of bacterial resistance, presence of synergy and broad antibacterial spectrum, the use of TMP/SMX is recommended in acute pyogenic bone and joint infections.
TI  - Cefadroxil, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefadroxil is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum and a high chemotherapeutic potential when administered orally. The inhibitory activity of this compound was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine when tested against 602 clinical isolates on Mueller-Hinton medium. In the oral treatment of experimental infections of mice, cefadroxil was more effective than cephalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes, and comparably effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and several gram-negative species. Administered orally to mice, at doses ranging from 25 to 100 mg/kg, cefadroxil attained peak concentrations in the blood similar to those of cephalexin. At a dose of 200 mg/kg, however, higher peak levels were noted with cefadroxil than with cephalexin. In regard to other properties which were investigated, the behavior of cefadroxil compared favorably to that of cephalexin.
TI  - [Occurrence and etiology for subclinical mastitis in cows].
AB  - Studied were a total of 16,571 cows on 89 farms by means of the Bernburg test. Milk was sampled from the positively reacting quarters of the udder by taking 18,047 samples intended for bacteriologic investigation. The demonstration of mastitis streptococci was carried out on "TKT" agar Merk, of pathogenic staphylococci, hemolytic streptococci, and Corinebacteria--on dextrose agar Oxoid containing 7.5% citrated calf blood. The isolated hemolytic streptococcus bacteria from the two nutrient media were differentiated through the CAMP test as well as serologically by the precipitation agar gel and Difco sera. The pathogenicity of Staphylococcus bacteria, in addition through hemolysis, was tested by the use of plasma coagulase with citrated rabbit plasma. In 53.95% of the cases there were secretory lesions due to Sc. agalactiae (6.23%) to Sc. dysgalactiae (5.69%) to Sc. uberis (8.47%), to Staph. aureus (2.44%), to hemolytic streptococci of the C, G and L groups (0.28%), to Sc. viridans (0.03%), to Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.41%), and catarrhal mastitis (30.4%). Some of the causative agents, such as Sc. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and others have proved of epidemiologic importance to humans.

TI  - Biological characteristics of peptidoglycans of group A streptococcus and some other bacterial species. I. Tolerance and effect of antibody in fever response, and heart damaging effect in rabbits.
AB  - Induced tolerance to the pyrogenic action of group A streptococcus peptidoglycan  decreased after one week and was no longer detectable after the second week. However, one or two further doses of peptidoglycan rapidly restored the tolerance. The passive transfer of plasma from rabbits tolerant to streptococcus peptidoglycan to nontolerant animals failed to transfer tolerance. Antiserum to streptococcus peptidoglycan neutralized the pyrogenic effect of not only streptococcus but also staphylococcus and pneumococcus peptidoglycan; it did not influence the febrile response to endotoxin. Histopathologic changes in the rabbit heart produced by the intravenous injection of staphylococcus or pneumococcus peptidoglycans were similar and were characterized by various stages of degeneration and necrosis. The changes were less pronounced than after streptococcus peptidoglycan. Antiserum to streptococcus peptidoglycan had modest or no counteracting effect on the development of heart alterations after staphylococcus or pneumococcus peptidoglycan.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tibezonium (TBZ).
AB  - The activity in vitro of tibezonium (Rec 15-0691), a new 1,5-benzodiazepine derivative, has been investigated. The drug was found active especially against Streptococcus, Diplococcus and Corynebacterium strains which are agents of oropharyngeal diseases. The activity of tibezonium was pH dependent against Staphylococcus aureus SG 511 and Streptococcus pyogenes 821 (at pH 8.0-8.5 It was more active) and the presence of horse serum provoked a small decrease of the antimicrobial properties. No interference on the activity of the tibezonium has been found in presence of smokers and non-smokers saliva.
TI  - [Etiology of mastitidos in dairy cows in Slovakia during 1975].
AB  - In 1975, in the veterinary institutes in Slovakia bacteriological examinations of 54824 samples of milk coming from 28737 dairy cows were performed. Bacterial germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 18.91% of cows. These were: Streptococcus agalactiae (in 13.93% of cows), Staphylococcus aureus (2.86%), other streptococci (1.32%), E. coli (0.13%), Klebsiella sp. (0.13%), Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.15%), other bacterial germs (0.39%). Streptococci and staphylococci, taken together, represented 95.83% of all bacterial germs, Streptococcus agalactiae representing 73.72%. In comparison with the situation existing in 1974, a drop was found in the occurrence rate of the germs of Streptococcus agalactiae (by 2.94%) and Staphylococcus aureus (by 1.16%).
TI  - Bacteriocin production by group a streptococcal L-forms.
AB  - L-forms induced from a bacteriocin-producing strain of group A streptococcus retained both the ability to produce the streptococcin and producer strain immunity to the homologous bacteriocin. L-forms of a spontaneously cured (bacteriocin negative) derivative of this same strain failed to produce streptococcin but were sensitive to its action.

TI  - Peripheral dissemination of bacteria in contaminated wounds; role of devitalized  tissue: evaluation of therapeutic measures.
AB  - The role of available therapeutic agents in the management of infection has long  been a continuing source of debate. This study assessed the rapidity of lateral dissemination of three common pyogenic organisms from wounds. The Streptococcus spreads peripherally with greater speed than the Staphylococcus or E. coli. Appraisal of the role and effectiveness of jet wound irrigation, debridement, and penicillin provides firm evidence that, of these three therapeutic agents, the only one that can control bacterial proliferation in a contaminated wound is the antibiotic. The primary role of energized jet irrigation is to remove clots and wound debris. The specific function of debridement is removal of devitalized tissue, in which role it has no effective competitor. These studies demonstrate that devitalized tissue in a contaminated wound quickens the rapidity of peripheral spread of all three micro-organisms. Systemic penicillin plus saline irrigation is the most effective therapeutic measure at both the second and fourth postinoculation hours in nondevitalized contaminated wounds. Debridement proved to be the most effective therapeutic device at the second, fourth, and sixth postinoculation hours in devitalized wounds.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of N. gonorrhoeae by bacterial interference.
AB  - Observations made in our laboratory during the past 3 years showed that the growth of some Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures was inhibited in the presence of various bacterial contaminants of urogenital specimens. A total of 647 cultures confirmed as containing N. gonorrhoeae were examined in this study. The first part of the study was carried out on 520 N. gonorrhoeae cultures. Of these 520 cultures, 110 (21.1%) showed contamination on purity plates (GC medium, antibiotic-free). When further subcultured, 96 (87.3%) of the N. gonorrhoeae strains grew in pure culture, but 14 (12.7%) failed to grow. Subsequently, experiments were carried out on 127 pure N. gonorrhoeae cultures. The bacterial species that inhibited the growth of N. gonorrhoeae are listed in order of frequency: Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group A, and Neisseria subflava.
TI  - Decadron in the treatment of cerebral abscess. An experimental study.
AB  - Forty rabbits were inoculated with Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus to produce cerebral abscesses. One-third of the rabbits received no treatment and served as controls. One-third received dexamethasone (Decadron) plus an appropriate antibiotic. One-third received only the appropriate antibiotic in the same dosage. The animals were sacrificed 10 days after inoculation and the brains examined. In the control group, an abscess at the stage of granulation tissue encapsulation containing the inoculated organisms was found. The surrounding brain showed a marked inflammatory response. In the Decadron plus antibiotic group, necrotic lesions were found containing the inoculated organisms and surrounded by relatively normal brain. In the group treated with antibiotic alone, healed glial scars were found in relatively normal brain. Our findings are discussed with reference to the medical literature regarding the influence of glucocorticoids on the inflammatory response and the efficacy of antibiotics when this response is suppressed.

AB  - Fifty-five patients with impetigo, ecthyma, or folliculitis caused by epicillin-sensitive strains of Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus were treated with 500 mg epicillin capsules twice daily for an average duration of 9 days. Bacteriological and clinical examinations were performed at 2-day intervals. Favourable clinical responses (excellent or good) were obtained in 95% of the patients. No side effects were observed.
TI  - Idiopathic late-onset immunoglobulin deficiency. Clinical observations in 50 patients.
AB  - Fifty patients with late-onset idiopathic immunoglobulin deficiency were studied  and the frequency of various clinical associations and complications was observed. Men and women were equally affected, although the age at onset in men peaked in the third decade whereas it was more uniformly distributed in women. Sinobronchopulmonary infections were common and were caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus: bronchiectasis occurred in 28 per cent. Thirty patients (60 per cent) had diarrhea, which was often associated with steatorrhea, giardiasis, achlorhydria, abnormal Schilling tests and morphologic abnormalities on small bowel biopsy specimens, including nodular lymphoid hyperplasia; three patients had pernicious anemia. In the 20 patients without diarrhea these abnormalities were not observed except for giardiasis in one patient and achlorhydria in two patients. Cholelithiasis occurred in both groups in about a third of the patients tested. A high degree of susceptibility to neoplasia was noted. Thyroid abnormalities, including primary hypothyroidism and Graves' disease, were observed in six patients. Additional occasional findings were vitiligo, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and arthritis. Splenomegaly occurred in 14 (28 per cent) patients. The percentage of B lymphocytes in the blood was determined in 10 patients; it was normal or slightly decreased in eight patients and low in two patients.
TI  - Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics. Comparison of patterns in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany.
AB  - One hundred and eighty five strains of Gram-positive cocci were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics, including some newer drugs, by agar dilution technique. Of these, 100 strains (50 each isolated in Poland and Germany) were Staphylococcus aureus, 55 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 30 Diplococcus pneumoniae. Previous investigations of streptococci and pneumococci isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Grmany, revealed no differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns in both countries, which was not the case with staphylococci. Present study demonstrates further evidence for existence of differences in antibiotic-sensitivity of staphylococci, depending of their geographical origin, and presents actual state of susceptibility to antibiotics of Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae.

TI  - Streptococcal sore throat in general practice--a controlled study.
AB  - A controlled study was undertaken to determine the incidence of Group A haemolytic streptococci and other bacterial pathogens in throat swabs from patients presenting with sore throats. The isolation rate (38-8%) of Group A haemolytic streptococci from patients with acute tonsillitis was significantly higher than the isolation rate (8-9%) in a control group, but there was no significant difference in the isolation rates in patients diagnosed as having acute pharyngitis compared with the control group. There was no difference in the isolation rates of the other bacterial pathogens in the patient and control groups. In-vitro antibiotic studies were performed, and a comparison was made of the results of these tests and the treatment prescribed.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae. In contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including Haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter. Bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. The majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. The results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including H. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.

Results show no antibacterial activity of dehydrocolic acid derivatives, while deoxycol-lys-OH-HCl, and particularly deoxycol-lys-NH2-2HCl, seem to be very effective on Gram-positive bacteria at 5 mug/ml, and on Gram-negatives at 25 mug/ml.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative determinations of the combined effect of tetracycline and oleandomycin. I. In vitro effect.
AB  - Growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment of tetracycline (TC) and oleandomycin (OM), at a ratio of 2:1, on certain species of pathogenic bacteria including drug-resistant ones was examined. By the crossed paper strip method, synergistic effects were demonstrated against 9 of the 16 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and all of the 5 strains of Escherichia coli studied. Antagonism was observed with none of the strains and with 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae tested in the present experiments. The MICs determined by the agar dilution method, also gave similar results, although synergism was not conclusively demonstrated by this method. With representative strains of S. aureus, synergism was evidenced by quantitative measurement of growth inhibition. In some strains, 1.0 mug of one drug per ml of medium inhibited the induction of resistance to the second drug. Such a small dose of one drug also inhibited the development of a mutant resistant to the second drug. These inhibitory actions were thought to be one of the important factors causing the synergistic effect of TC and OM on drug resistant bacteria.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - Activity of four cephalosporin antibiotics in vitro against bovine udder pathogens and pathogenic bacteria isolated from newborn calves.
AB  - The in vitro activity of chephaloridine, cephalexin, cefatrizine (BL-S640), and cephapirin (BL-P-1322) was evaluated by the serial dilution method against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine udders and neonatal calf diseases. Cephapirin showed the comparatively greatest activity against the most common streptococcal species associated with bovine mastitis, whereas cephaloridine exhibited the best activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Cefatrizine was more active than the other cephalosporins against the gram-negative bacteria studied. In general, the minimal bactericidal concentration of each cephalosporin was two- to fourfold lower than the comparative value reported in the literature against the same type of pathogen of human origin.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Microorganisms in chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A total of 175 effusions obtained from 172 patients suffering from chronic otitis media with effusions was examined for bacterial smear and culture. Eighty percent showed positive bacterial smear, but only 49% yielded positive bacterial culture. The mucoid effusions had positive cultures in only 37%, whereas the bacterial culture rate was higher in serous (59%) and leukocytic (64%) types. The isolation of common pathogens accounted for about 50% of the isolates, and nonpathogens accounted for the remaining 50%. The high incidence of microorganisms in the middle ear effusions in the present series raises the possibility of bacterial contribution in many cases of OME.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility studies with josamycin and erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of josamycin and erythromycin against five bacterial species was compared. In general, erythromycin was slightly more active by weight than josamycin, although both agents had a similar range of activity.
TI  - [Ultrastructure of L forms. Report 5. localization of dehydrogenase activity in L form cells].
AB  - A study was made of deposition of diformazan TNBT and TCNBT in the presence of succinate and without it in stable L-forms of Str. pyogenes group A, St. aureus and L. monocytogenes. Diformazan proved to deposit on the cytoplasmic membrane, in the lamellar mesosomes and myelin-like structures and also on individual intracellulor membranes not forming special membrane organoids. Diformazan was localized on the membranes mostly asymmetrically, on the cytoplasmic membrane-on its internal side, and on the ring-like intracellulor membranes- externally. Localization of diformazan on the ring-like membranes is atributed to the fact that ring-like membranous structures in the L-forms formed as a result of invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane in the same way as bacterial mesosomes. Since L-form cells could not be released of endogenous substrates by the methods elaborated for bacteria, cytological data did not permit to ascertain dehydrogenases, responsible for asymmetrical localization of diformazan on the L-form membranes. On the basis of these data one can judge only the sum total activity of dehydrogenases in different membranes.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.

TI  - Tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  - SYNOPSIS: Tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those for gentamicin. Tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. Theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by P. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. Clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with gentamicin. Whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of P. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. Like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. The efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination has been shown in endocarditis caused by P. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to gentamicin plus carbenicillin. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. Antimicrobial activity: In comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. Against Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. For most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. Gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against Serratia marcescens. Like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro in low concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus. Tobramycin is essentially inactive against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. The sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. Wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent MIC values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...
TI  - Induction of adjuvant arthritis in the rat by various bacterial cell walls and their water-soluble components.
AB  - A number of purified cell walls of various gram-positive bacteria had arthritogenic activity in the rat. The water-soluble adjuvant-active component(s), which were isolated from some of these cell walls by utilizing a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme, did produce severe adjuvant arthritis. However, the components obtained by digestion with glycan-degrading enzymes failed to produce arthritis. Thus, the present finding indicates the importance of a peptidoglycan portion, especially its intact glycan chain, for induction of adjuvant arthritis.
TI  - Amide Penicillin Wy-12,556: therapeutic activity in animals subjected to repeated bacterial infection.
AB  - Amide penicillin Wy-12,556 and DBED penicillin were studied for their antibacterial effect in CD-1 mice repeatedly infected with Streptococcus pyogenes C203 and/or Staphylococcus aureus Smith. Animals infected with S. aureus Smith failed to show a difference between the therapeutic activity of DBED penicillin and Wy-12,556. Wy-12,556 was significantly more effective than DBED penicillin in protecting the animals challenged repeatedly with S. pyogenes C203. Wy-12,556 provoked a positive transient chemotactic response in uninfected mice. 24 h after intraperitoneal challenge the exudate showed a high neutrophilic count.
TI  - [Azidocillin: activity in vitro, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic results in whooping cough].
AB  - In vitro activities of acidocillin and ampicillin were compared in 20 strains of  Haemophilus influenzae, 50 strains of Enterococci and 4 strains of Bordetella pertussis by serial dilution test. There were no significant differences between both antibiotics. On Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains) and Streptococcus group A (25 strains) acidocillin was effective at the same degree as phenoxymethylpenicillin. After oral administration of 0.75 g acidocillin (1 h after a standard breakfast) serum peaks in 10 healthy adults were 6.1 +/- 0.51 mug/ml (after 1 1/2 h) which decreased to 0.5 +/- 0.10 mug/ml (after 4 h) and to 0.045 +/- 0.02 mug/ml (after 6 h). Urine-recovery in 9 h after oral administration of 0.75 g was found as of 58%, after i.v. administration of the same dose 78% (absorption rate nearly 74%). Therapy of whooping cough in 12 children with acidocillin (60 mg/kg/die) led to the disappearance of Bordetella pertussis from nasal swabs (only one failure caused by the child's frequent vomiting).
TI  - [The effect of standardised sodium hypochlorite solution on bacteria pathogenic for the urinary tract (author's transl)].
AB  - Stable sodium hypochlorite solution shows excellent disinfectant properties, even in higher dilution. Parallel to clinical tests in vitro experiments were made to show the changes of morphology of bacteria pathogenic for the urinary tract by scanning microscope. Two hours after incubation of the bacteria with sodium hypochlorite solution containing 40 mg available chlorine/1 severe damages of the bacterial morphology up to complete destruction were evident in all cases. Gram-negative rod-shaped bacilli were more, gram-positive cocci were less damaged.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin.
AB  - Flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. The bactericidal activity of the drug against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. Each of the three penicillins was administered orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. The mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. The percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. Using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. These findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.

TI  - Production and properties of an extracellular bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans bacteriocidal for group A and other streptococci.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. The lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts of a standardized suspension of group A streptococci in broth. No lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen in electron micrographs. The material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups A, C, D, G, H, L, and O streptococci. It was inactive against strains of S. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. It was sensitive to trysin and Pronase and resistant to catalase. It possessed a molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. The properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. Group A streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as did the sensitive cells. The bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 C.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Growth of common bacteria and Candida albicans in 10% soybean oil emulsion.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. fecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees C, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. Growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. In 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except S. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was S. aureus. In the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except S. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa. C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. While at 4 degrees C, organisms did not multiply. The fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. Because both bacteria and C. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. When this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.
TI  - [Nasopharyngeal microorganisms--antagonists of meningococci].
AB  - A study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. Saprophytic streptococci and particularly Str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. Comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. However, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly Str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy individuals, and nondifferentiated Gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. Taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of Str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.
TI  - Cephalexin monohydrate suspension. Treatment of otitis media.
AB  - Cephalexin monohydrate suspension was used in the treatment of 97 children with otitis media. Pretreatment middle-ear exudate specimens in pure or mixed culture yielded Diplococcus pneumoniae in 47 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 26, Neisseria catarrhalis in 20, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in 13, and Staphylococcus aureus in one. The usual dosage was 100 mg/kg/day given orally in divided doses for 10 to 12 days. After 48 hours of treatment, follow-up cultures showed that therapy had been successful in 90 children; 81 remained clinically and bacteriologically free of disease for at least three weeks following therapy. Of the seven children for whom therapy failed, H influenzae persisted in five and D pneumoniae in two. Acceptance of the drug was entirely satisfactory with no important side effects encountered.
TI  - Bacterial skin infections in preschool and school children in coastal Tanzania.
AB  - In coastal Tanzania, 1,855 preschool and school children were studied for pyoderma (superficial bacterial infections of the skin exclusive of secondarily infected scabies) and for scabies. The predisposing personal, socleoeconomic, and hygienic variables for both conditions were studied also. Pyoderma lesions and some secondarily infected scabies were cultured aerobically for bacterial isolates and the predisposing factors were determined by interviews, home visits, and physical examinations. Pyoderma was present in 6.9% and scabies in 16.6% of the children; both combined totalled 23.5% of the children. Both conditions were more common in rural than in urban environments, but scabies was most common in populations with poor socioeconomic and hygienic conditions. The predisposing factors included trauma, insect bites, hot and damp coastal weather, and poor socioeconomic and hygienic conditions.
TI  - Endemic infection in surgical wards.
AB  - Endemic infection in male surgical wards has been studied during three periods. There was some infection due to gram-negative bacilli, though Staphylococcus aureus remained as the single most important pathogen even in the absence of epidemic spread. Beta haemolytic streptococci were isolated in large numbers from the lesions of four patients with deep wound infection. Changes introduced in the pattern of post-operative care reduced sepsis due to Staph. aureus, reduced the severity of wound infection and apparently decreased the need for antibiotic therapy. Patients who became infected were retained in hospital longer than those who escaped clinically apparent infection.
TI  - [Microbiological study of gentamiycin].
AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.

TI  - Scabies and other skin diseases in pre-school children in Ujamaa villages in Tanzania.
AB  - A survey of skin diseases was carried out in pre-school children in five Ujamaa villages in Rufiji district and 532 children (5.3% of the total population) were screened. The results showed that scabies was the commonest skin problem affecting 31% of the children. Primary pyoderma and fungal infections were relatively less common and accounted for 7.0 and 2.4% respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta haemolytic streptococci and Corynebacterium diphteriae were the commonest pathogeneic bacteria isolated from both infected scabies and primary pyoderma. Tinea capitis was similarly the commonest fungal infection and Microsporium audouinii was the main pathogen. The high prevalence of scabies was attributed to poor hygiene, overcrowding with intimate personal contact. The low prevalence of pyoderma was due to the fact that we did not include secondarily infected scabies and eczema amongst the cases of pyoderma.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity of pathogens from infected skin lesions.
AB  - One hundred and seven patients attending an accident and emergency department with infected skin lesions were studied. The commonest organisms isolated were Staph aureus and Strep pyrogenes. Routine antimicrobial sensitivity testing of bacterial isolates showed that the antibiotic most likely to be effective against the organisms isolated was a cephalosporin or a tetracycline.
TI  - [Etiology of mastitis in dairy cows in Slovakia during 1972-1974].
AB  - In the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in Slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. On an annual average, the number of examined samples was higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. Germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. The following bacterial germs were represented: Streptococcus agalactiae - 15.77%, Staphylococcus aureus - 4.19%, other streptococci - 1.49%, E. coli - 0.18%, Klebsiella sp. - 0.23%, Corynebacterium pyogenes - 0.20%, other germs - 0.26%. The number of dairy cows having bacterial germs in their milk was found higher by 1.47% than in 1967-1971. The number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae was higher by 3.29% and that of Straphylococcus aureus by 1.15% than in the period from 1967 to 1971. The higher number of the findings of the bacterial causative agents responsible for mastitis was due, in particular, to the increased number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae in milk.

TI  - [Production of sera for determining group A Streptococcus using the precipitation in gel reaction].
AB  - The sera of rabbits immunized with the culture of streptococcus, group A, treated with pepsin were studied by the immunodiffusion methods. The sera intensively reacted with the polysaccharide of the streptococcus, group A, but not with the polysaccharide of the streptococcus of A-variant and with the proteins contained in the hyfrochloric extracts of group A. Some of the sera contained antibodies to polyglycerophosphate and antigen E4 which could be eliminated by sorption of the sera with the culture of the streptococcus of A-variant treated with pepsin. Despite the sorption, individual sera reacted with the hydrochloric extracts obtained from the streptococcus, group L, or the S. aureus. The sera reacting with the polysaccharide of group A could be used for the identification of streptococcus, group A, by the method of precipitation in gel. The advantages of the method consist in its simplicity and distinct result, which can be obtained in two hours.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Sensitive assay for detection of toxin-induced damage to the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts.
AB  - A sensitive assay was developed for detection and quantitation of subtle permeability changes in the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts. Release of the non-metabolizable amino acid [1-14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB; molecular weight (103) from the cytoplasm of prelabeled cells was used as an indicator of toxin-induced membrane damage. An optimal procedure for labeling these cells was designed after varying the conditions with regard to pH, temperature, concentration of AIB, composition of medium, and incubation time. Toxin-induced release of AIB was compared with release of a previously described nucleotide label, [3H]uridine. Melittin from bee venom and the polyene antibiotics filipin and amphotericin B in low concentrations induced a strikingly greater release of AIB than of nucleotide label. The sensitivity of this assay was furthermore demonstrated by treatment with the following bacterial cytolysins: phospholipase C and theta-toxin from Clostridium perfringens, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-toxins from Staphylococcus aureus, and streptolysin S from Streptococcus pyogenes. In spite of their different modes of action, all these membrane-active toxins at low concentrations induced a significant release of AIB label. For an equal release of nucleotide label, several times higher concentrations were required.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of mannopeptins.
AB  - Mannopeptins show in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and some  gram-negative bacteria. The antimicrobial activity is unaffected by the addition of serum, and potentiated by alkaline pH or decrease in inoculum size. The antibiotics exert bectericidal effect at doses twice as high as the minimum inhibitory concentration. When the antibiotics were injected into mice through either intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes, the antimicrobial activity appeared within 15 minutes in the serum of mice and was slowly excreted in the urine. However, the antibiotics were poorly absorbed by the oral route. The antibiotics were capable of protecting mice from lethal infection produced by the intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and the intraperitoneal injection of Shigella sp. and Escherichia coli, but ineffective against Salmonella typhosa.
TI  - The inhibition of bacterial growth by ochratoxin A.
AB  - A series of bacterial species was examined for their sensitivity to ochratoxin A. Only grampositive bacteria could be inhibited, generally at a pH lower than 7.0. Bacillus subtilis did not show any reduction of growth rates in presence of ochratoxin A, but had a prolonged lag phase. With Staphylococcus pyogenes var. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, a prolonged lag phase and a reduction of the growth rate was observed. Most sensitive was Streptococcus faecalis in the exponential-growth phase. The inhibition could be diminished by changing the pH to neutral, or by addition of yeast extract, tetrahydrofolate, or MgSO4. With MgSO4 a complete abolition of the inhibitory effect was achieved, but not with CaCl2. During growth inhibition, protein and RNA synthesis were reduced simultaneously, but not DNA synthesis. Even with the very high concentration of 1 mg/ml, no lethal effect was observed.
TI  - Migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group A and B streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. In the present studies peptidoglycans from S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group A streptococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast, HSA-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. Sensitization of animals with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; HSA-pentapeptide again showed no activity. However, when HSA-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was evident. Skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to HSA-pentapeptide.
TI  - The thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycans.
AB  - The peptidoglycan of group A Streptococcus prepared by hot formamide or TCA extraction has an expressive ability to lyse rabbit blood platelets in vitro. Initial changes in the ultrastructure of platelets can be observed after 10 minutes incubation of rabbit platelets with 0.1 mug of Streptococcus peptidoglycan per ml. The submicroscopic alterations are characterized by changes of the shape and damage of the limiting membrane of the platelets. Larger amounts of peptidoglycan (10 mug/ml and more) cause total destruction of platelets; only remainders of the limiting membrane and free granulomers can be seen. Peptidoglycans of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus exhibit a comparable effect on rabbit platelets. There are substantial differences in the sensitivity of blood platelets of different animal species to the streptococcal peptidoglycan. Rat platelets exhibit a similar thrombocytolytic effect after the Streptococcus peptidoglycan treatment as rabbit ones; however, the development of comparable changes in their submicroscopic structure needs a dose of peptidoglycan 10(2)-10(3) times higher. Platelets of guinea-pig, dog, cat, calf and human appear to be quite resistant under analogous conditions to as such a high dose of Streptococcus peptidoglycan as 500 mug/ml.
TI  - Endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. The pyrogenic response of rabbit to group A streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or TCA is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. The pyrogenicity can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of the material by lysozyme. Peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group B and L streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. Spirillum serpens and Escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. Repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. Cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. Rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to S. aureus and group A streptococcus peptidoglycans. Intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages of the degenerative and necrotic process. Local Shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. The results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. Non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. These properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. The data presented suggest the role of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.
TI  - Effects of cytochalasin B on the intrcellular bactericidal activity of human neutrophils.
AB  - Cytochalasin B (CB) is known to have some inhibitory effects on cytokinesis, single-cell movement, bacterial uptake by phagocytes, and many other processes. The effects of CB on intraleukocytic bactericidal activities in human leukocytes were studied, and the results were summarized as follows. (i) CB inhibited the early stage of the intracellular bactericidal activity of human leukocytes against Streptococcus pyogenes D58 (group A). The effect was rapidly eliminated by rinsing the CB solution. (ii) In the late stage of the intracellular bactericidal process, however, CB possessed no effect against S. pyogenes D58 (group A) and Staphylococcus aureus 209P. (iii) CB also inhibited the translocation of myeloperoxidase granules to the phagosomes of human neutrophils.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - The varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
AB  - In this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) were first determined against each of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, Sulfamylon, and Betadine). Then the sensitivity of each organism growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. Significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. Total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. The changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. Sulfamylon, was associated with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. Streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. It is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they more closely simulate the real clinical situation. Therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.
TI  - Correlation of human in vivo and in vitro cutaneous antimicrobial factors.
AB  - the presence of antimicrobial substances on human skin was investigated. Staphyloccus aureus (10-4 colony-forming units) was applied on the forearm of 50 subjects and covered with a semiocclusive device for 24 hr. In 54% of the subjects the organisms persisted, and in 34% S. aureus was inhibited on the skin. Subjects with persistent S. aureus also had persistent Candida albicans, and vice persa. This correlation was not noted with Streptococcus pyogenes. Skin lipids from the two groups of subjects were extracted with acetone and assayed against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and C. albicans. The percentage of S. aureus or C. albicans recovered was higher (79% and 55%, respectively) in subjects with persistent microrgamisms on their skin than in those without (47% and 28%, respectively). Subjects with persistent S. aureus and C. albicans had higher counts of normal flora (average, 9.2 times 10-3) than those on whose skin these organisms did not persist (average, 7.4 times 10-2). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Micrococcus were found in higher proportions in subjects with persistent test organisms than in those without. Subjects with lower counts of their normal flora had a higher proportion of diphtheroids (34%) than the high-count group (12%).
TI  - Intraleukocytic bactericidal activity in patients receiving corticosteroid and radiation therapy, and in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Bactericidal activities of peripheral white blood cells obtained from patients and from healthy persons were examined in vitro. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Peripheral white blood cells from patients receiving corticosteroid and radiation therapy showed decreased levels of intracellular bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus. The leukocytes from almost all patients examined displayed intense activities of intracellular bacterial killing against Streptococcus pyogenes. 2. Only polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages obtained from patients in severe stages of diabetes mellitus exhibited decreased levels of intracellular bactericidal activities against S. aureus. 3. The leukocytes from all patients examined exhibited the same levels of intracellular bactericidal effects against S. pyogenes as leukocytes from healthy persons. 4. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was phagocytized by PMNs obtained from healthy persons, demonstrated a remarkable degree of resistance to any intracellular bactericidal effect.

AB  
TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - [Etiology of common impetigo].
AB  
TI  - Epidemiological aspects of impetigo contagiosa in western Sweden.
AB  - 200 patients with primary impetigo were studied. Staphylococcus aureus was the only organism isolated in 72.5%, beta-hemolytic streptococci, group A, in 10%, and both pathogens in 15%. 17 of the 50 streptococcal isolates were typed serologically; 11 of these belonged to potentially nephritogenic types. A majority of these cases had identical strains in the nose and throat. Hence, the primary source of skin streptococcal in this study may be the nasopharynx. Uncomplicated cases were treated with topical antibiotics, and oral antibiotics were added in 22 cases with extensive lesions, fever or a concurrent throat infection. None of the 200 patients developed acute glomerulonephritis and urinary analyses were normal at follow-up after 3 weeks.
TI  - In vitro bacteriological study of a new antibiotic substance: sisomicin.
AB  - Effects of a new antimicrobial agent sisomicin on microorganisms isolated from pathologic material (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes-B, Citrobacter Freundii) were studied. The results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. All three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). All three preparations were tested on 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a Streptomyces albus endo-N-acetylmuramidase lytic for group A and other beta haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - The purification and characterization of the streptolytic exo-enzyme from the Maxted-McCarty strain of Streptomyces albus is described. This enzyme was shown to be an endo-N-acetylmuramidase with a molecular weight of 10 to 12,000 and optimal activity at pH 8 and 45 degrees C. The enzyme is lytic for streptococci of various groups, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Escherichia coli. It closely resembles the F1 endo-N-acetylmuramidase described by Ghuysen et al. (1966) except for small differences in the products of lysis of streptococcal cell walls and the resistance of Escherichia coli to lysis by the F1 enzyme. Lysates of group A and A variant streptococcal cell walls prepared with purified Streptomyces albus muramidase contained serologically active M protein and C carbohydrate-peptidoglycan complexes. The chemical and immunological characteristics of these enzymmatic products of streptococcal cell walls are reported and their utility as immunologic reagents is described.
TI  - The bacteriological ecosystem of the skin of children in an African tropical envirovment (Tanzania).
AB  - Using a standardized method for sampling, the aerobic microbial flora of the skin of ninety-five children in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was studied qualitatively and quantitatively. The subjects comprised three groups; group A, thirty-seven normal infants (below the age of 1 year); group B, twenty-nine infants with various bacterial skin lesions; and group C, twenty-nine nursery school children between 4-5 and 7 years. The following observations were made: (I) The quantitative results indicated; (a) great variation between individuals, which was more marked among the females; (b) lower bacterial counts in infants than in older children; (c) counts were not affected by the presence of infection or state of cleanliness; (d) there were some differences between females and males and between different ethnic groups. (2) Qualitatively, the types of organisms isolated were similar to those reported elsewhere. There were differences in carrier rates of many organisms but these were most striking with Staphylococcus aureus and Staph. albus. It is concluded that there are great differences in carrier rates between persons in a tropical African environment and those studied elsewhere. These difference may be due to environmental, geographical or ethnic factors. Such observations call for more studies in this area to establish the normal flora.
TI  - Interaction of clindamycin and gentamicin in vitro.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. All 77 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of Clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. Gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. Sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. All 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of Clostridium, three strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. Except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. Antagonism was never observed.
TI  - Skin infections in eastern Panama. Survey of two representative communities.
AB  - A skin infection survey of 1,084 people was carried out in two jungle villages in eastern Panama. Bacterial pyoderma was the most prevalent infection, affecting 25% of boys, 15% of girls, and 11% of those over 10 years of age. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 84% of pyodermas cultured. Nearly 60% of the cutaneous staphylococcal isolates were resistant to penicillin. Hippelates flies were seen feeding on purulent skin lesions and may have been important in transmission. Scabies, ringworm, candidiasis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis were in comparison with pyoderma involving less than 1% of the population each. All of the ringworm infections were caused by Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - An outbreak of streptococcal skin sepsis in a closed community.
AB  - An outbreak of skin sepsis due to beta-haemolytic streptococcus group A M33, T3/13/B3264 occurred in a closed community. Staphylococcus aureus was also present in many of the lesions, but different strains were recognizable by phage typing. Environmental contamination was found. The outbreak was controlled by isolating infected boys and decontaminating the environment. Various aspects of the epidemiology and the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections are discussed.
TI  - In vitro studies of tobramycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tobramycin was studied against 457 clinical isolates of  gram-negative bacilli and 151 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. The vast majority of the gram-negative bacilli was inhibited by tobramycin at a concentration of 1.56 mug or less per ml. Only a few isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and no isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes or Diplococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to this drug. Tobramycin was generally more active than gentamicin sulfate against gram-negative bacilli, although organisms resistant to gentamicin sulfate were also resistant to tobramycin. The major difference between the two drugs was the greater activity of tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Maridomycin, a new macrolide antibiotic: in vivo antibacterial activity of 9-propionylmaridomycin.
AB  - The in vivo protecting activity of 9-propionylmaridomycin, a derivative of the new macrolide antibiotic, maridomycin, was compared with that of other macrolide antibiotics in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae. The protective effect was almost similar to that afforded by several known macrolide antibiotics in mice infected intraperitoneally with certain strains of the gram-positive species described above. The skin lesion caused by intradermal challenge of S. aureus in mice also responded very effectively to treatment with 9-propionylmaridomycin.
TI  - Morphological changes induced by wall inhibitors in pyogenic cocci.
AB  
TI  - Abolition of swarming of Proteus by p-nitrophenyl glycerin: application to blood  agar media.
AB  - Comparative plate counts were made of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish the swarming of Proteus. B-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (PNPG) were used as anti-swarm agents. Each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. In addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci. Phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. At 0.1 to 0.3 mM, PNPG proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. When laboratory strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm PNPG, they displayed similar growth and hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without PNPG.
TI  - Effect of elevated atmospheric pressure on penicillin binding by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A gas pressure of 68 atm, elicited by helium-oxygen gas mixtures, reduced the susceptibility to penicillin of Staphylococcus aureus but not of Streptococcus pyogenes. The elevated pressure also caused a reduction in the binding of (14)C-penicillin to S. aureus, but not to S. pyogenes. When these studies were extended to glycine incorporation, it was shown that, even without penicillin, pressurization reduced glycine incorporation into the cell wall of S. aureus. Incorporation into other cellular components was not altered by pressurization. Cells grown in a pressurized environment were slightly more susceptible than those grown at 1 atm to rapid change in osmotic pressure. In the presence of penicillin, glycine incorporation into the cell wall was reduced to the same low level at 68 atm and at 1 atm. These results suggest that pressurization renders S. aureus less susceptible to penicillin because it reduces the enzymatic activity of the binding component on the cell, a penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal effectiveness of four aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of four aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, Sch 13706, tobramycin, and sisomicin) was tested against eight gram-negative and three gram-positive species. A total of 323 strains were studied by the broth dilution technique. Tobramycin and sisomicin had greater bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas strains than did gentamicin and Sch 13706. Of the four antibiotics, sisomicin was most active against Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, indole-negative and -positive Proteus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Gentamicin was most effective against Serratia. A fourfold or greater difference existed frequently between the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of all antibiotics against Enterobacter and Serratia. This difference was greatest with tobramycin. Staphylococcus aureus was highly susceptible, Providencia relatively resistant, and enterococcus uniformly resistant to the antibiotics studied. Agar diffusion susceptibility testing with gentamicin and tobramycin showed that organisms susceptible to less than 6.2 mug/ml usually yielded zones 17 to 26 mm in diameters. Zones of 15 to 16 mm represented intermediate susceptibility which varied with the organism and antibiotic. Several Serratia strains required 6.2 to 12.5 mug of gentamicin/ml or 25 to 50 mug of tobramycin/ml for bactericidal activity despite minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.09 to 3.1 mug/ml and zone sizes greater than 13 and 17 mm, respectively. Studies with Enterobacter and tobramycin yielded similar results.
TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.
TI  - Effect of elevated atmospheric pressure on antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin, vancomycin,  sodium cephalothin, and tetracycline, but increased susceptibility to sodium colistimethate, at a pressure of 68 atm in helium or helium-oxygen gas. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes was unchanged by pressurization.
TI  - Carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  - Carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. Although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in Brain Heart Infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. With an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. Against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by E. coli, P. vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.
TI  - 7-(Alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridinothio)-acetamido) cephalosporanic acid.
AB  - 7-[alpha-(1-Methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as BL-S 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Experimental infection of the skin in the hamster simulating human impetigo. III. Interaction between staphylococci and group A streptococci.
AB  - The interaction between staphylococci and Group A beta hemolytic streptococci in  mixed lesions was investigated in an experimental impetigo model. A strain of staphylococcus of phage Type 71, which has been shown in vitro to produce a bacteriocin for streptococci and other Gram-positive organisms, eliminates or reduces Group A streptococci in mixed lesions. In contrast, staphylococcal strains of phage Types 75 and 81, which do not produce a demonstrable bacteriocin in vitro, exhibit no such effect. Some variation was noted in the in vivo response of two different streptococcal M Types to the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci. Bacterial antagonism is more pronounced when staphylococci and streptococci are injected simultaneously into animals than when staphylococci are superimposed on preexisting streptococcal lesions. Marked variations were found in the numbers of viable streptococci (colony-forming units) recovered from individual lesions containing identical mixtures of streptococci and phage Type 71 staphylococci. The frequency of a demonstrable bactericidal effect was related to the number of streptococci injected. With small inocula of streptococci, the tendency towards an all-or-none effect was particularly striking. No evidence of selection of streptococcal or staphylococcal mutants which might explain this phenomenon was obtained. These observations suggest that the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci on other Gram-positive organisms, previously demonstrated in vitro, appears to operate also in vivo.
TI  - Media exchange method for demonstrating killing of L-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  - Normal human serum has been shown to kill L-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. Previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. This failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and NaCl. A method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some L-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. Using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the L-phase variants of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi. This method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for L-phase variants.
TI  - Effects of intrarenal inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus on mice.
AB  - The extreme susceptibility of the mouse kidney to infection with Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed by direct intrarenal (i.r.) inoculation with this organism. By applying Poisson's distribution formula to the results from infection of mice with small inocula (as few as one coccus or less per kidney), it was estimated that even three organisms could multiply in situ to produce abscess lesions, if the organisms were inoculated directly into the kidneys. This susceptibility of the mouse kidney for staphylococcal infection was not uniformly manifested with every strain, but correlated well with the virulence found through intravenous infection of the strains tested. The i.r. inoculation method by which infection of mice was easily established, using a small inoculum of S. aureus, similar to the amount suspected to occur in natural infections of man, is applicable for the analysis of the mechanisms of staphylococcal infections and any resulting immunity in man. The present paper describes the details and some experimental results obtained by our method.
TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.
TI  - Epicillin: in vitro laboratory studies.
AB  - A new semisynthetic penicillin, structurally related to ampicillin, has been assigned the generic name epicillin, 6-[d-2-amino-2-(1, 4-cyclohexadienyl) acetamido]-penicillanic acid. The antimicrobial spectrum and level of activity of epicillin in vitro are similar to those of ampicillin. In studies with recent clinical isolates, these two antibiotics, when compared with carbenicillin, showed consistently higher antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus species. When tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, on the other hand, epicillin exhibited a level of intrinsic activity superior to that of ampicillin but less than that of carbenicillin. Epicillin is an amphoteric substance that is sensitive to penicillinase, is acid-stable, and is minimally, but reversibly, bound to human serum protein.
TI  - The effect of a changed environment on bacterial colonization rates in an established burns centre.
AB  - In an established burns centre which moved from an old building to new purpose-designed premises, colonization rates of patients' burns with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacilli were not reduced. Colonization rates with Streptococcus pyogenes increased but the increase was mainly due to multiple importations in the new premises of a strain of higher communicability than any seen in the old.In the first 32 months in the new environment 10 patients were found colonized with pseudomonas on admission and 20 became colonized in the unit. A much higher proportion of patients with burns of more than 30% body surface became colonized than of patients with less. About one-third of the above 20 patients became colonized with strains already isolated from another patient; all but one of them had small area burns. Cross-infection was not observed from numerous heavily colonized patients with high percentage burns. This paradox is discussed in detail. Basin outflows in the new premises became colonized with P. aeruginosa of two serotypes not found on patients in this unit.
TI  - Improved medium for detecting deoxyribonuclease-producing bacteria.
AB  - Incorporation of methyl green dye into an agar medium containing deoxyribo-nucleic acid results in an improved medium for detecting deoxyribonuclease-producing bacteria. Use of the dye makes it unnecessary to use acid to demonstrate deoxyribonuclease activity, thus allowing subculture or reincubation of colonies. The improved medium is highly sensitive and can be used for primary isolation of Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - In vitro action of carbenicillin against bacteria isolated from clinical material.
AB  - More than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution modalities. The same bacteria, which included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Aerobacter-Enterobacter group, various species of Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. The responses of pyocine-typed P. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. The majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. The concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. The laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.
TI  - Modified microbiological assay for rapid estimation of antibiotic concentrations  in human sera.
AB  - Antibiotic concentrations in human sera were estimated in 5 to 6 hr by a modified microbiological assay. By using Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes as the assay organisms, the seeded assay plates were preincubated for 2 to 6 hr and then were stored at 4 C until used for assay. Paper discs saturated with the specimen were placed on the preincubated assay plates with reference discs saturated with known concentrations of antibiotic. After 5 to 6 hr of incubation, zones of antibacterial activity were measured and compared with a standard curve for estimation of antibiotic concentration. Results from this rapid assay method compared favorably with those from the commonly used 24-hr assay.
TI  - Combined effects of diphenyliodonium chloride, pine oils, and mustard oil soaps on certain microorganisms.
AB  - Bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of an emulsion containing 10.0% (v/v)  terpineol, 0.5% (w/v) diphenyliodonium chloride, 11.0% (v/v) ethyl alcohol, and 5.62% saponified mustard oil were tested against a number of different types of organisms. The bactericidal concentration for Salmonella typhosa was 1:400. In the presence of 5.0% horse serum, it increased to 1:250. The bacteriostatic concentration varied from organism to organism; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus required 4,000 mug/ml for complete bacteriostasis, whereas Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Salmonella paratyphi-A, and Shigella required only 2,000 mug/ml for complete inhibition. A 4.0% concentration of the emulsion killed the spores of Bacillus subtilis within 6 hr.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin C antibiotic.
AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.
TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
TI  - Effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  - The comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. Large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae AD, Salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Streptococcus pyogenes C203, Salmonella pullorum #2, Proteus vulgaris 1810, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. In contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. In a more chronic bacterial infection due to Corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. Indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. Hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial infection. Insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.
TI  - Biological characterization of prasinomycin, a phosphorus-containing antibiotic.
AB  - Prasinomycin, a new antibiotic from the green spore streptomycete, Streptomyces prasinus, primarily inhibits the growth of gram-positive microorganisms. Like penicillin, it is effective only against growing cells. Though primarily bacteriostatic at levels about the minimal inhibitory concentration, it is bactericidal at higher levels. Neither synergism nor antagonism could be demonstrated for prasinomycin with a variety of other antibiotics. It is highly active upon subcutaneous administration to mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes C203, or Diplococcus pneumoniae. Prasinomycin has a unique prophylactic action whereby one dose protects mice against experimental infections for as long as 2 months. It is more effective against S. aureus infections in mice when administered subcutaneously 20 hr prior to infection than when given in divided doses 1 hr before and 4 hr after infection.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus pyogenes on tissue cells.
AB  - Human tissue cell lines from each of the three primary germinal sources, ectoderm (conjunctiva and carcinoma of the buccal mucosa), entoderm (intestine and liver), and mesoderm (heart and monocytes) were inoculated with group A Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and group D streptococci and were then observed. In addition, the effect of these bacteria on mouse fibroblasts was studied. All of the cell lines appeared to be equally susceptible to damage, but damage to the cells by S. pyogenes occurred only when living, actively multiplying bacteria were in contact with the tissue cells. Streptococcal products in the form of "used" growth medium had no observable effect on the cells. Cytopathogenic effects were first noticed about the time one would expect the bacteria to have reached the end of the log phase of growth. No damage to the tissue cells was noted when group A streptococci were separated from the cells by membrane filter diffusion chambers or dialyzing membranes, but a membrane did not protect cells from deleterious effects of staphylococci or group D streptococci. Group A streptococci survived in the tissue culture medium, but multiplication did not occur unless living tissue cells were present.
TI  - U-21,963, a new antibiotic. I. Discovery and biological activity.
AB  - A new antibiotic, U-21,963, is produced by a new strain of Trichoderma viride. Antibiotic activity can be demonstrated against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against a wide variety of fungi. U-21,963 is not cross-resistant with other commonly used antibiotics. U-21,963 afforded no protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Staphylococcus aureus when it was injected subcutaneously into mice.
TI  - Heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Chorpenning, Frank W. (The Ohio State University, Columbus), and Matthew C. Dodd. Heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 91:1440-1445. 1966.-Soluble antigens obtained by various methods from gram-positive bacteria were used to modify erythrocytes whose hemagglutinating reactions with immune rabbit sera and normal human sera were then studied. Antigens from all gram-positive organisms studied except corynbacteria altered red cells, causing them to react with specific bacterial antisera and with normal human sera; however, cross-absorption and inhibition tests indicated that at least three different specificites were involved. One of these antigens seemed to be similar to Rantz's streptococcal NSS, which is shared with Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp., and is therefore heterogenetic. Another was found in streptococci but was apparently not present in S. aureus and Bacillus spp. A third antigen, also heterogenetic, appeared to be shared by several species of Bacillus and by S. aureus, but not by streptococci or any gram-negative bacteria. The third antigen was heat-stable at pH 8.0, and appeared to be essentially polysaccharide in nature. Normal human sera varied in their content of antibodies which reacted with erythrocytes modified by extracts from gram-positive bacteria. Whereas some sera reacted very broadly with red cells modified by extracts of practically any gram-positive organism, other sera agglutinated only cells which had been modified by streptococcal antigen.

TI  - PLASMA COAGULATION BY ORGANISMS OTHER THAN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS.
AB  - Bayliss, Berenice G. (Washington State University, Pullman), and Elizabeth R. Hall. Plasma coagulation by organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus. J. Bacteriol. 89:101-105. 1965.-Approximately 200 organisms were investigated for their ability to clot human and rabbit plasma. Various anticoagulants were used in preparing the plasma: acid-citrate-dextrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, balanced oxalate, potassium and sodium oxalates, and heparin. Twelve organisms were found which coagulated citrated plasma in less than 8 hr: four strains of Streptococcus faecalis; two strains of S. faecalis var. zymogenes; three strains of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens; and one strain each of S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Six strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus were selected for use as controls. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which these microorganisms coagulated citrated plasma. As this was the only plasma clotted, it was presumed that the citrate was utilized by the microorganisms, thereby releasing the calcium which was then made available so that normal physiological clotting could occur. To test this hypothesis, a chromatographic method was employed to determine the presence or absence of citrate. Coagulation tests, by use of increasing amounts of citrate, showed a linear relationship between the amount of citrate in the plasma and the coagulation time. It was demonstrated that the organisms must be actively metabolizing to clot citrated plasma. Proof for this was obtained by using a cell-free filtrate, to which thimerosal had been added to inhibit growth, instead of whole cultures for the coagulation test. Only the coagulase-positive staphylococci coagulated the citrated plasma under these conditions. From the results obtained, it was concluded that plasma coagulation by these organisms was by citrate utilization.

AB  - Thirty cases of respiratory infections in adult dogs were treated with colistimethate sodium. E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Paracolobactrum sp., and Aerobacter aerogenes responded to therapy, whereas Proteus sp., Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to treatment.

TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.
TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
TI  - Inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  - Streightoff, Frank (The Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, Ind.). Inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. J. Bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-Several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-FNA) have been demonstrated to inhibit Streptococcus sp. (Viridans group), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus plantarum in vitro. The most active compounds were 5-FNA and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-FNAM). The growth of Streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-FNA or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-FNAM. The inhibition of Streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-FNA or 5-FNAM was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. The inhibition of E. coli from 100 parts of 5-FNA or 5-FNAM was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. Inhibitions by most other active compounds could be reversed by nicotinic acid. In experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-FNA had activity against Streptococcus pyogenes; 5-FNA, 5-FNAM, and 5-fluoro-N-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. The action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-FNA was reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. The activity of 5-FNA was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of some alpha-amino-oxy-acids, alpha-amino-oxy-hydrazides, alkoxyamines, alkoxydiguanides and their derivatives.
AB  - A series of compounds containing an amino-oxy-group has been examined for antibacterial and antifungal activity. The amino-oxy-acids and the alkoxyamines showed little activity, but the hydrazides, notably the amino-oxydodecyl and the amino-oxytetradecyl compounds, had appreciable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The alkoxydiguanides showed considerable bactericidal activity in vitro against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and some activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most active compounds were those with a chain containing 10 to 14 carbon atoms, but the activity was considerably reduced in the presence of serum. They were also active against the few fungi tested. The most active compound, decyloxydiguanide, was moderately toxic when administered intraperitoneally to mice and no therapeutic activity could be demonstrated against an intraperitoneal injection of Streptococcus pyogenes administered 15 min. previously.
TI  - Studies on Streptococcus pyogenes. IV. Effect of whole cells, M and C antigens, and other components of the cell on adrenalectomized rats.
AB  - Heat-killed cells of Group A streptococci caused death of the adrenalectomized rat. While the adrenalectomized rat readily succumbed to intraperitoneal infection with living cells, death was due primarily to toxicity. The normal rat was highly resistant under either condition. For studies on the toxic materials, the cells of numerous serological types of group A streptococci, and of a Group B and a Group D streptococcus, were extracted with 0.1 N HCl at 100 degrees C. or by sonic oscillation. The extracts, containing macromolecular components, were subjected to chemical fractionation and purification. C substance and M protein of Group A streptococci released from the cell by sonic oscillation were toxic to the adrenalectomized rat in quantities of 1 mg./100 gm. rat. Death usually occurred within 2 hours. On the other hand, C substance and M protein released from the cell with HCl at 100 degrees C. were relatively non-toxic to the adrenalectomized rat. The sonic-extracted C substance of streptococcal Groups B, C, and D was also toxic. The toxic property of the C and M preparations was neutralized in vitro in each case by group and type-specific rabbit antiserum. Heterologous antiserum was without effect. Adrenalectomized rats which received homologous antiserum 18 hours before challenge were also resistant to the toxicity of the C and M preparations. Trypsin destroyed the toxic effect of the M protein preparations and was without effect on the toxicity of the C substance. The R antigen and a nucleoprotein component of Group A streptococci, preparations of protein from Groups B and D streptococci, and coagulase from Staphylococcus aureus were all found to be essentially non-toxicic for the adrenalectomized rat. Large quantities of peptone, crystalline albumin, and rabbit serum were also without effect.

TI  - The international standard for bacitracin.
AB  - In 1952, the Department of Biological Standards, National Institute for Medical Research, London, was authorized by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization to proceed with the establishment of an International Standard for Bacitracin. Thirty grams of bacitracin were obtained and it was decided to compare the proposed International Standard with the existing Working Standard for Bacitracin of the United States Food and Drug Administration.Six laboratories in five countries participated in the collaborative assay. A total of 52 assays was carried out, but the overall weighted mean potency was calculated from only the 48 biological assays, the 4 assays by the Hiscox method being excluded. The biological assays were done by the plate, the cylinder, or the disc method, using Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium xerosis, or Micrococcus flavus.After analysing the results by standard statistical methods, the authors established the batch of bacitracin examined as the International Standard. The Standard contains 55 International Units of activity per mg, and the International Unit has therefore been defined as the activity contained in 0.0182 mg of the International Standard for Bacitracin.

TI  - CYANIDE-SENSITIVE BACTERIAL RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL CYTOCHROME-CYTOCHROME OXIDASE SYSTEM.
AB  - Aerobic respiration of Streptococcus pyogenes and pneumococcus Type 1 are strongly inhibited by KCN, NaN(3), and Na(2)S. The anaerobic glycolysis of glucose by pneumococcus is also inhibited by KCN and NaN(3). Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, pneumococcus Type 1, B. subtilis, B. proteus, and Staphylococcus aureus did not catalyze the oxygen uptake by p-phenylenediamine in the presence of added cytochrome c or in its absence. Yeast cells, B. subtilis, and B. pyocyaneus oxidized p-phenylenediamine to a dark purple meriquinoid substance in contrast to the other bacteria mentioned above. Streptococcus pyogenes in contrast to pneumococcus Type 1 catalyzed the oxygen uptake by cysteine. Neither of these bacteria catalyzed the oxygen uptake by tyrosine, adrenaline, pyrocatechin, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococcus Type 1, and E. coli, boiled and not boiled, gave positive peroxidative tests with benzidine showing the presence of hematin compounds. The results discussed in the light of the interpretations offered by Keilin and Harpley show that Streptococcus pyogenes and pneumococcus Type 1 contain cyanide-sensitive respiratory systems which are different from the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase system.
TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF ACUTE ALCOHOLISM ON THE NORMAL VITAL RESISTANCE OF RABBITS TO INFECTION.
AB  - THE DEDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: That the normal vital resistance of rabbits to infection by streptococcus pyogenes (erysipelatos) is markedly diminished through the influence of alcohol when given daily to the stage of acute intoxication. That a similar, though by no means so conspicuous, diminution of resistance to infection and intoxication by the bacillus coli communis also occurs in rabbits subjected to the same influences. And that, while in alcoholized rabbits inoculated in various ways with staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, individual instances of lowered resistance are observed, still it is impossible to say from these experiments that in general a marked difference is noticed between alcoholized and non-alcoholized animals as regards infection by this particular organism. It is interesting to note that the results of inoculation of alcoholized rabbits with the erysipelas coccus correspond in a way with clinical observations on human beings addicted to the excessive use of alcohol when infected by this organism. In the course of the work an effort was made to determine if, through the oxidation of alcohol in the tissues to acids of the corresponding chemical group, the increase of susceptibility could be referred to a diminution in the alkalinity of the blood as a result of the presence of such acids. The number of experiments thus far made on this point is too small to justify dogmatic statements, but from what we have gathered there is but little evidence in support of this view. Throughout these experiments, with few exceptions, it will be seen that the alcoholized animals not only showed the effects of the inoculations earlier than did the non-alcoholized rabbits, but in the case of the streptococcus inoculations the lesions produced (formation of miliary abscesses) were much more pronounced than are those that usually follow inoculation with this organism. With regard to the predisposing influence of the alcohol, one is constrained to believe that it is in most cases the result of structural alterations consequent upon its direct action on the tissues, though in a number of the animals no such alteration could be made out by macroscopic examination. I am inclined, however, to the belief, in the light of the work of Berkley and of Friedenwald, done under the direction of Prof. Welch, in the Pathological Laboratory of the Johns Hopkina University, that a closer study of the tissues of these animals would have revealed in all of them structural changes of such a nature as to indicate disturbances of important vital functions of sufficient gravity to fully account for the loss of normal resistance. The conspicuous influence of the alcohol on the gastric mucous membrane in many of these animals, with the consequent disturbance of nutrition, is undoubtedly the explanation of the marked loss in body weight that was observed in many of the animals employed in these experiments. In this light the susceptibility induced by alcohol to excess is somewhat analogous to that induced by starvation, where we see the resistance of animals to particular forms of infection very markedly diminished.
