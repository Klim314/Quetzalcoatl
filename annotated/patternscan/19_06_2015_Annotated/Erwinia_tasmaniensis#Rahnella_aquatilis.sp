TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == frequency and diversity of small cryptic plasmids in the genus rahnella.
AB  == background: rahnella is a widely distributed genus belonging to the enterobacteriaceae and frequently present on vegetables. although rahnella has interesting agro-economical and industrial properties and several strains possess antibiotic resistances and toxin genes which might spread within microbial communities, little is known about plasmids of this genus. thus, we isolated a number of rahnella strains and investigated their complements of small plasmids.  results: in total 53 strains were investigated and 11 plasmids observed. seven belonged to the cole1 family; one was cole2-like and three shared homology to rolling circle plasmids. one of them belonged to the pc194/pub110 family and two  showed similarity to poorly characterised plasmid groups. the g+c content of two  rolling circle plasmids deviated considerably from that of rahnella, indicating that their usual hosts might belong to other genera. most cole1-like plasmids formed a subgroup within the cole1 family that seems to be fairly specific for rahnella. intriguingly, the multimer resolution sites of all cole1-like plasmids  had the same orientation with respect to the origin of replication. this arrangement might be necessary to prevent inappropriate synthesis of a small regulatory rna that regulates cell division. although the cole1-like plasmids did not possess any mobilisation system, they shared large parts with high sequence identity in coding and non-coding regions. in addition, highly homologous regions of plasmids isolated from rahnella and the chromosomes of erwinia tasmaniensis and photorhabdus luminescens could be identified. conclusions: for the genus rahnella we observed plasmid-containing isolates at a frequency of 19%, which is  in the average range for enterobacteriaceae. these plasmids belonged to different groups with members of the cole1-family most frequently found. regions of striking sequence homology of plasmids and bacterial chromosomes highlight the importance of plasmids for lateral gene transfer (including chromosomal sequences) to distinct genera.
