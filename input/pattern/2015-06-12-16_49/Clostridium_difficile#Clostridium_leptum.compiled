TI  - Fecal transplantation treatment of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis and  long-term microbiota follow-up.
AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and is considered as a treatment for other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. We followed up the relief of symptoms and long-term, over-a-year microbiota stabilization in a 46-year-old man, who underwent FMT for antibiotic-induced, non-CDI colitis nine months after being treated for CDI by FMT. Fecal and mucosal microbiota was analyzed before the second FMT and during 14 months after FMT by using a high-throughput phylogenetic microarray. FMT resolved the symptoms and restored normal GI-function. Microbiota analysis revealed increased bacterial diversity in the rectal mucosa and a stable fecal microbiota up to three months after FMT. A number of mucosa-associated bacteria increased after FMT and some of these bacteria remained increased in feces up to 14 months. Notably, the increased bacteria included Bifidobacterium spp. and various representatives of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, such as Clostridium leptum, Oscillospira guillermondii, Sporobacter termitidis, Anaerotruncus colihominis, Ruminococcus callidus, R. bromii, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, and C. colinum, which are presumed to be anti-inflammatory. The presented case suggests a possible role of microbiota in restoring and maintaining normal GI-functionality and improves our knowledge on the etiology of antibiotic-induced, noninfectious colitis.
TI  - Fidaxomicin preserves the intestinal microbiome during and after treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and reduces both toxin reexpression and recurrence of CDI.
AB  - The microflora-sparing properties of fidaxomicin were examined during the conduct of a randomized clinical trial comparing vancomycin 125 mg 4 times per day versus fidaxomicin 200 mg twice per day for 10 days as treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Fecal samples were obtained from 89 patients (45 received fidaxomicin, and 44 received vancomycin) at study entry and on days 4, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 38 for quantitative cultures for C. difficile and cytotoxin B fecal filtrate concentrations. Additionally, samples from 10 patients, each receiving vancomycin or fidaxomicin, and 10 samples from healthy controls were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with multiple group-specific primers to evaluate the impact of antibiotic treatment on the microbiome. Compared with controls, patients with CDI at study entry had counts of major microbiome components that were 2-3-log(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/g lower. In patients with CDI, fidaxomicin allowed the major components to persist, whereas vancomycin was associated with a further 2-4-log(10) CFU reduction of Bacteroides/Prevotella group organisms, which persisted to day 28 of the study, and shorter term and temporary suppression of both Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum group organisms. In the posttreatment period, C. difficile counts similarly persisted in both study populations, but reappearance of toxin in fecal filtrates was observed in 28% of vancomycin-treated patient samples (29 of 94), compared with 14% of fidaxomicin-treated patient samples (13 of 91; P = .03). Similarly, 23% of vancomycin-treated patients (10 of 44) and 11% of fidaxomicin-treated patients (5 of 44) had recurrence of CDI. Whereas vancomycin and fidaxomicin are equally effective in resolving CDI symptoms, preservation of the microflora by fidaxomicin is associated with a lower likelihood of CDI recurrence.
TI  - Determinants of the human infant intestinal microbiota after the introduction of  first complementary foods in infant samples from five European centres.
AB  - Although it is well established that early infant feeding has a major influence on the establishment of the gut microbiota, very little is understood about how the introduction of first solid food influences the colonization process. This study aimed to determine the impact of weaning on the faecal microbiota composition of infants from five European countries (Sweden, Scotland, Germany, Italy and Spain) which have different lifestyle characteristics and infant feeding practices. Faecal samples were collected from 605 infants approximately 4 weeks after the introduction of first solid foods and the results were compared with the same infants before weaning (6 weeks of age) to investigate the association with determining factors such as geographical origin, mode of delivery, previous feeding method and age of weaning. Samples were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry using a panel of 10 rRNA targeted group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. The genus Bifidobacterium (36.5 % average proportion of total detectable bacteria), Clostridium coccoides group (14 %) and Bacteroides (13.6 %) were predominant after weaning. Similar to pre-weaning, northern European countries were associated with a higher proportion of bifidobacteria in the infant gut microbiota while higher levels of Bacteroides and lactobacilli characterized southern European countries. As before weaning, the initial feeding method influenced the Clostridium leptum group and Clostridium difficile+Clostridium perfringens species, and bifidobacteria still dominated the faeces of initially breast-fed infants. Formula-fed babies presented significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides and the C. coccoides group. The mode of birth influenced changes in the proportions of bacteroides and atopobium. Although there were significant differences in the mean weaning age between countries, this was not related to the populations of bifidobacteria or bacteroides. Thus, although the faecal microbiota of infants after first complementary foods was different to that before weaning commenced, many of the initial influences on microbiota composition were still evident.
