TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == curative effect of the probiotic strain lactobacillus fermentum l23 in a murine model of vaginal infection by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection characterized by changes in the vaginal microbiota. the objective of this work was to evaluate the colonization ability and curative effect of lactobacillus fermentum l23 after vaginal administration in female balb/c mice infected with gardnerella vaginalis. one dose of lact. fermentum l23 containing 10(9 ) cfu ml(-1) was administered locally in a murine vaginal model. l23 colonized the vaginal tract of balb-c mice after one inoculation. the infection by g. vaginalis in a murine model was induced by vaginal administration of a 1 x 10(6 ) cfu ml(-1) suspension. infection with the  pathogen was observed in the vaginal tract for 4 days. at 144 h after inoculation, levels of 4 log10 cfu ml(-1) were observed. the curative effect of l23 was evaluated with one administration at 1 x 10(9 ) cfu ml(-1) 72 h after the inoculation with g. vaginalis. lactobacillus fermentum l23 inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. the results of suppression of g. vaginalis using different concentrations of l23 were favourable due that these concentrations are normally  used in commercial formulas. the obtained results indicate that lact. fermentum l23 inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. therefore, l23 might be used as a potential biotherapeutic agent for the elimination of this bacterium. significance and impact of the study: the use of the probiotic strain lactobacillus fermentum l23 as a biotherapeutic agent can be expected to prevent  and treat genital infections, particularly recurrent bacterial vaginosis, with similar concentrations to those normally used in commercial formulas. it is likely that the use of this probiotic strain for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis will provide a natural and nontoxic treatment modality.

TI  == biomedical applications of fermenticin hv6b isolated from lactobacillus fermentum hv6b mtcc10770.
AB  == fermenticin hv6b is a class iia antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus fermentum hv6b mtcc 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. it shows growth  inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, bacteroides, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, staphylococci, and streptococci,  associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. it does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four  different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. this information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.

TI  == in vitro probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum sk5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  == a lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. this strain, identified as lactobacillus fermentum sk5, was able to survive at ph 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible  to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. l. fermentum sk5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic escherichia coli and  vaginal pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis. the effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kda, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. further studies revealed that l. fermentum sk5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. this lactobacillus showed coaggregation with e. coli and g. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. the adhesion of l. fermentum sk5 to hela, ht-29 and caco-2 cells and its inhibition of e. coli and g. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. these incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of l. fermentum sk5 that would prevent binding and growth of e. coli and g. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. on the basis of the ability of l. fermentum sk5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it  is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
