TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == inguinal syndrome secondary to prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  == the authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. as far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by prevotella. prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and  are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as prevotella spp., mobiluncus spp., gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.

TI  == in vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in kenyan women.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. we sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess h2o2 production. vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following bv treatment. one hundred and fifty eight lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of  the 107 women. lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against bv-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth  of bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. respectively. the lactobacilli produced supernatants with a ph range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (ph 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. there was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). acid, bacteriocins and h2o2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. these substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == use of dna hybridization to detect vaginal pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis among asymptomatic pregnant women.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine whether microbial dna hybridization is a useful method to study bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. study design: vaginal specimens were collected at <26 weeks' gestation from 230 women, and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis by both gram stain using nugent criteria and dna hybridization for gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and mobiluncus curtisii. results were analyzed using mcnemar's paired test and chi-square test for trend, with significance set  at p < .05. results: by gram stain, 60 (26.1%) of 230 were positive for bacterial vaginosis, and 134 (58.3%) were negative. by dna hybridization, 99 (43%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen, and dna results were significantly associated with gram-stain results (p < .01). as the nugent score progressed from normal to  abnormal flora, the proportion with >1 pathogen detected by dna hybridization increased significantly (p < .001). conclusion: dna hybridization may be a useful method to study shifts in vaginal flora during pregnancy.

TI  == activity of novispirin g-10, a novel antimicrobial peptide against chlamydia trachomatis and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  == we tested the activity of novispirin g-10, a novel antimicrobial alpha-helical octadecapeptide structurally related to cathelicidins and other innate immunity peptides, against chlamydia trachomatis serovars l2, d, and e and three organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). the peptide's activity against c. trachomatis was measured in 48-h shell vial assays with mccoy cell targets. exposure to 100 micro g/ml of novispirin g-10 reduced the infectivity of serovars d and e by 99.4-100% and serovar l2 by 91.7-99.1%. at the same concentration of 100 micro g/ml, novispirin g-10 rapidly killed >99% of mobiluncus curtisii, gardnerella vaginalis, and prevotella bivia, in standard colony-forming unit (cfu) assays. given its simple structure and relative lack of cytotoxic and hemolytic activity, novispirin g-10 may be a useful component of microbicide preparations designed to prevent chlamydial infection and/or remediate the abnormal vaginal flora associated with bv.

TI  == vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women: reliability of sialidase detection.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma hominis in vaginal specimens of women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv) as well as to determine the sensitivity and specificity  of the direct sialidase assay of vaginal fluid as a rapid test for diagnosing this syndrome. methods: vaginal cultures were obtained from 109 nonpregnant women (mean age 33 +/- 7.1 years), 47 of them with clinical signs of bv (bv+) and 62 of them without bv (bv-). in addition, we determined the vaginal sialidase activity  in both groups, which may serve as a feature of this syndrome. results: anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 91% and 18% of the bv+ and bv- groups, respectively (p  < 0.001). peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella bivia and porphyromonas spp. were strongly associated with bv. p. bivia and prevotella spp. represented 44% of all  the anaerobes isolated in the bv+ group. all the isolated p. bivia strains presented sialidase activity. g. vaginalis and m. hominis were isolated in 76% and 42% of the bv+ and 1% and 0% of the bv- women, respectively (p < 0.001). mobiluncus morphotypes were observed in 34% of the bv+ and 0% of bv- women. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sialidase activity were 81%, 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. conclusions: our  data demonstrate a strong association between g. vaginalis, m. hominis, and p. bivia and bv. sialidase activity and gram stain of vaginal fluid represent accurate methods for diagnosing bv.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activities of du-6859a and other fluoroquinolones against  japanese isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of du-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and gardnerella vaginalis. du-6859a was the most active agent; it inhibited 90% of isolates of almost all species tested, including bacteroides fragilis at < or = 0.39 micrograms/ml. although the other quinolones tested were active against gram-positive anaerobes, inhibiting their growth at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, these agents were less active against the b. fragilis group and prevotella bivia  (90% of which were inhibited at > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml). mobiluncus species and g. vaginalis, which are well associated with bacterial vaginosis, were inhibited by du-6859a at 0.1 microgram/ml. these results suggest that du-6859a is a promising oral agent for the treatment of bacterial infections due to anaerobic bacteria; however, further studies, including determination of vaginal levels of  this compound, should be performed to study the role of du-6859a in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == evaluation of the etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  == one hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 gardnerella vaginalis, 16 mobiluncus spp., 19 peptostreptococcus spp., 20 lactobacillus spp., 20 prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 bacteroides fragilis group, 12 clostridium spp., and five fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference (brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. for the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). the quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. results with b. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. the absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. the etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common of the vaginitides affecting women of reproductive age. it appears to be due to an alteration in the vaginal ecology by which lactobacillus spp., the predominant organisms in the healthy vagina, are replaced by a mixed flora including prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, porphyromonas spp., mobiluncus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. all of these organisms except mobiluncus spp. are also members of the endogenous vaginal flora. while evidence from treatment trials does not support the notion that bv is sexually transmitted, recent studies have shown an increased risk associated with multiple sexual partners. it has also been suggested that the pathogenesis of bv may be similar to that of urinary tract infections, with the rectum serving as a reservoir for some bv-associated flora. the organisms associated with bv have also been recognized as agents of female upper genital tract infection, including pelvic inflammatory disease, and the syndrome bv has been associated with adverse outcome of pregnancy, including premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and fetal loss; postpartum endometritis; cuff cellulitis; and urinary tract infections. the mechanisms by which the bv-associated flora causes  the signs of bv are not well understood, but a role for h2o2-producing lactobacillus spp. in protecting against colonization by catalase-negative anaerobic bacteria has been recognized. these and other aspects of bv are reviewed.
