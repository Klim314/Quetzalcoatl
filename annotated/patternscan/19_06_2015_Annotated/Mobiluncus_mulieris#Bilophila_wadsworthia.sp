TI  == biochemical differentiation and comparison of desulfovibrio species and other phenotypically similar genera.
AB  == seventeen human clinical isolates representing four species of desulfovibrio were characterized using 16s rrna gene sequences and tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, bile, urease, formate-fumarate stimulation, desulfoviridin, motility, and hydrogen sulfide production, plus susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. eighty additional strains representing 10 phenotypically similar genera (bilophila, selenomonas, capnocytophaga, campylobacter, bacteroides, sutterella,  anaerobiospirillum, dialister, veillonella, and mobiluncus) were included for comparison. all desulfovibrio species produced h2s and were desulfoviridin positive, and all desulfovibrio species except d. piger were motile. the four desulfovibrio species could be distinguished from each other using tests for catalase, indole, nitrate, urease, and growth on bile, with the following results (positive [+], negative [-], growth [g], and no growth [ng]): for d. piger, -, -, -, -, and g, respectively; for d. fairfieldensis, +, -, +, -, and g, respectively; for d. desulfuricans, -, -, +, +, and ng, respectively; and for d.  vulgaris, -, +, -, -, and g, respectively. resistance to the 10-microg colistin disk separated the desulfovibrio species from most of the other genera, which were usually susceptible. these simple tests were useful for characterizing the desulfovibrio species and differentiating them from other phenotypically similar  genera.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.
