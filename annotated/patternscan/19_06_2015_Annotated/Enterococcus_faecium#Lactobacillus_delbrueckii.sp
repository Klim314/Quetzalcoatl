TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == oral administration of multispecies microbial supplements to sows influences the  composition of gut microbiota and fecal organic acids in their post-weaned piglets.
AB  == the timings of the administration of microbial supplements to control the populations of gut microbiota of piglets have been poorly understood. here the effects of temporal administering multispecies microbial supplements to sows on the composition of gut microbiota and on the bacteria-mediated fecal metabolites  in their offsprings were investigated. during gestation and lactation, pregnant sows were fed either a normal diet (group a) or a diet with multispecies supplements comprised of nine microbial species such as lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, candida pintolopesii, and aspergillus oryzae etc. (group b). all of the sows' piglets were temporarily fed with the same supplements around weaning in accordance with  the guideline of the farm. this regimen was followed by a normal diet in both groups over one month thereafter. under such conditions, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (scfas) in fecal samples remarkably increased in group b  compared to group a. when 16s rdna sequences of the fecal bacteria were analyzed, the microbial structure of bacteria was different between both goups. especially  the clostridium cluster iv and subcluster xiva were particularly increased in group b, although the administered microbes were undetectable. thus, temporal administration of multispecies-microbial supplements to pregnant sows changes the composition of scfas and gut microbiota in their offsprings.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == the effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  == the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lat 187, lactobacillus acidophilus lat 180, lactobacillus helveticus lat 179, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis lat 182, streptococcus thermophilus lat 205 and enterococcus faecium e 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. chickens were divided into three groups (c, control;  e1 and e2, experimental groups). experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. in the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of  probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.

TI  == influence of microfiltration and adjunct culture on quality of domiati cheese.
AB  == the effects of microfiltration and pasteurization processes on proteolysis, lipolysis, and flavor development in domiati cheese during 2 mo of pickling were  studied. cultures of starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from egyptian dairy products were evaluated in experimental domiati cheese for flavor development capabilities. in the first trial, raw skim milk was microfiltered and then the protein:fat ratio was standardized using pasteurized cream. pasteurized milk with same protein:fat ratio was also used in the second trial. the chemical composition of cheeses seemed to be affected by milk treatment-microfiltration or pasteurization-rather than by the culture types. the moisture content was higher  and the ph was lower in pasteurized milk cheeses than in microfiltered milk cheeses at d 1 of manufacture. chemical composition of experimental cheeses was within the legal limits for domiati cheese in egypt. proteolysis and lipolysis during cheese pickling were lower in microfiltered milk cheeses compared with pasteurized milk cheeses. highly significant variations in free amino acids, free fatty acids, and sensory evaluation were found among the cultures used in domiati cheesemaking. the cheese made using adjunct culture containing lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and enterococcus faecium received high scores in  flavor acceptability. cheeses made from microfiltered milk received a higher score in body and texture compared with cheeses made from pasteurized milk.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == isolation of cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with  mesophilic starter and molecular comparison with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains.
AB  == aims: to isolate cultivable thermophilic lactic acid bacteria from cheeses made with mesophilic starter and compare them with dairy-related lactobacillus helveticus strains using molecular typing methods. methods and results: the number of thermophilic bacteria in seven commercial cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starters was estimated to be <10 cfu g(-1). implementation of an enumeration step in the isolation method made it possible to isolate one thermophilic strain from each of five of seven cheeses. comparing repetitive sequence pcr (rep-pcr) profiles of the isolates with dairy-related lact. helveticus strains indicated that one isolate was a lact. helveticus. partial sequencing of 16s rrna confirmed this, and the remaining four strains were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecium. the rep-pcr profile of the isolated lact. helveticus was identical to the rep-pcr profile of the lact. helveticus adjunct culture used in the specific  cheese, but their pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiles differed slightly. conclusion: it was possible to isolate cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses manufactured with mesophilic starter and thermophilic adjunct cultures by using an enumeration step. significance and impact of the study: isolation of cultivable thermophilic bacteria from ripened cheeses made with mesophilic starters offers an original source for new dairy-relevant cultures.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == rep-pcr characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the delta area of egypt.
AB  == samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting. the identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. the obtained results revealed that the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, enterococcus faecium lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in egyptian dairy products. two percent of lactococcus, 10% of lactobacillus and 1% of enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of lactococcus, 70% of lactobacillus and 50% of enterococcus isolates. some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.

TI  == growth control of listeria innocua 2030c on vacuum-packaged cold-smoked salmon by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == five bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab): enterococcus faecium et05, lactobacillus curvatus et06, l. curvatus et30, l. deldrueckii et32 and pediococcus acidilactici et34, selected by their capacity for growth and producing inhibition in vitro at high salt-on-water content, low temperature and  anaerobic atmosphere, conditions simulating cold-smoked fish, were inoculated onto salmon fillets, in co-culture with listeria innocua 2030c, and cold-smoked processed (dry salted for 6 h; drying for 6 h; smoke for 2 h). the finished product was then packed under vacuum and stored at 5 degrees c. enumeration of lab and l. innocua was performed during storage. results showed that strain e. faecium et05 was the best biopreservative candidate for controlling l. innocua growth in vacuum-packaged cold-smoked salmon (css) processed under the salting/drying/smoking parameters referred above. l. curvatus et30 and l. delbrueckii et32 also showed a good biopreservation potential for css although they were less effective than the former. l. curvatus et06 and p. acidilactici et34 showed a bacteriostatic mode of action against the target bacteria in vitro  as well as when inoculated into the salmon fillets. this study describes a potential application of five different lab in the biopreservation of listeria in css.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == a novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  == secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." the growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. it was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kda; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other gram-positive bacteria, such as l. innocua, s. aureus 209, and lactobacillus delbrueckii b2, nor against some gram-negative species, such as escherichia coli hb101.

TI  == variability of bacterial biofilms of the "tina" wood vats used in the ragusano cheese-making process.
AB  == ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the hyblean region of sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. to explore the ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce ragusano cheese.  raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and by classical enumeration microbiology. with the use of universal primers, pcr-ttge revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and enterococcus faecium. after  the stretching, ttge profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. in the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, s. thermophilus being predominant in both. biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by pcr-ttge, pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific pcr tests, and sequencing, confirming the  predominance of lactic acid bacteria (s. thermophilus, l. lactis, and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-gc-content species, like coryneform bacteria. the spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. the lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  == in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates  of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
