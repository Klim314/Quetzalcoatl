TI  == identification and characterization of phon-sf, a gene on the large plasmid of shigella flexneri 2a encoding a nonspecific phosphatase.
AB  == a gene encoding a nonspecific phosphatase, named phon-sf, was identified on the large virulence plasmid (pmysh6000) of shigella flexneri 2a ysh6000. the phosphatase activity in ysh6000 was observed under high-phosphate conditions. however, it was found that low-phosphate conditions induced a slightly higher level of activity. the nucleotide sequence of the phon-sf region cloned from pmysh6000 possessing the phon-sf gene encoded 249 amino acids with a typical signal sequence at the n terminus. the deduced amino acid sequence of the phon-sf protein revealed significant homology to sequences of nonspecific acid phosphatases of other bacteria, such as providencia stuartii (phon, 83.2%), morganella morganii (phoc, 80.6%), salmonella typhimurium (phon, 47.8%), and zymomonas mobilis (phoc, 34.8%). the phon-sf protein was purified, and its biochemical properties were characterized. the apparent molecular mass of the protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was calculated to be 27 kda. the 20 amino acids at the n terminus corresponded to the 20 amino acid residues following the putative signal sequence of phon-sf protein  deduced from the nucleotide sequence. the phon-sf activity had a ph optimum of 6.6, and the optimum temperature was 37 degrees c. the enzymatic activity was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, n-bromosuccinimide, or dithiothreitol but not by edta. the subcellular localization of the phon-sf protein in ysh6000 revealed that the protein was found predominantly in the periplasm. examination of shigella and enteroinvasive escherichia coli strains for phon-sf production by immunoblotting with the phon-specific antibody and for the presence of phon-sf dna by using a phon-sf probe indicated that approximately one-half of the strains possessed the phon-sf gene on the large plasmid and expressed the phon-sf protein. the tn5 insertion mutants of ysh6000 possessing phon-sf::tn5 still retained wild-type levels of invasiveness, as well as the subsequent spreading capacity in mk2 epithelial cell monolayers, thus suggesting that the phon-sf activity is not involved in expression of the virulence phenotypes of shigella strains under in vitro conditions.

TI  == characterization and sequence of phoc, the principal phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase of morganella morganii.
AB  == phosphatase activities were investigated in morganella morganii, which is one of  the few enterobacterial species producing high-level phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase activity (hpap phenotype), and the gene encoding the major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase was cloned, sequenced, and its product characterized. using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, morganella produced a  major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named phoc) which is associated with the hpap phenotype, a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase, and a  phosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase. the presence of the phoc activity prevented induction of alkaline phosphatase when a phoc-hydrolysable organic phosphate ester, such as glycerol 2-phosphate, was the sole phosphate source. phoc is a secreted nonspecific acid phosphatase apparently composed of four 25 kda polypeptide subunits. the enzyme is resistant to edta, p(i), fluoride and tartrate. the m. morganii phoc showed 84.6% amino acid sequence identity to the phon nonspecific acid phosphatase of providencia stuartii, 45.3% to the phon nonspecific acid phosphatase of salmonella typhimurium, and 37.8% to the principal acid phosphatase (phoc) of zymomonas mobilis. comparison of sequence data and of regulation of these enzymes suggested a different phylogeny of members of this gene family within the enterobacteriaceae.
