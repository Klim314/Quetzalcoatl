TI  == comparison of the compositions of the stool microbiotas of infants fed goat milk  formula, cow milk-based formula, or breast milk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == clostridium difficile colonization in early infancy is accompanied by changes in  intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major enteric pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. host susceptibility to c. difficile infections results partly from inability of the intestinal microbiota to resist c. difficile colonization. during early infancy, asymptomatic colonization by c. difficile is  common and the intestinal microbiota shows low complexity. thus, we investigated  the potential relationship between the microbiota composition and the implantation of c. difficile in infant gut. fecal samples from 53 infants, ages 0 to 13 months, 27 negative and 26 positive for c. difficile, were studied. dominant microbiota profiles were assessed by pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). bacterial signatures of the intestinal microbiota associated with colonization by c. difficile were deciphered using principal component analysis (pca). resulting bands of interest in ttge profiles were excised, sequenced, and analyzed by nucleotide blast (ncbi). while global biodiversity was not affected, interclass pca on instrumental variables highlighted significant differences in dominant bacterial species between c. difficile-colonized and noncolonized infants (p = 0.017). four bands were specifically associated with the presence or absence of c. difficile: 16s rrna gene sequences related to ruminococcus gnavus and klebsiella pneumoniae for colonized infants and to bifidobacterium longum for noncolonized infants. we demonstrated that the presence of c. difficile in the intestinal microbiota of infants was associated with changes in this ecosystem's composition. these results suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota might be crucial in the colonization process, although the chronology of events remains to be determined.
