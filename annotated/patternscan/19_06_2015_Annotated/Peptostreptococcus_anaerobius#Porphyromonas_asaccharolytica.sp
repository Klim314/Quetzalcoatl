TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
