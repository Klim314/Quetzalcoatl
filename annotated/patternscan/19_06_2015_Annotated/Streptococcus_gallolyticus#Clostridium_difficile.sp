TI  == icesp1116, the genetic element responsible for erm(b)-mediated, inducible resistance to erythromycin in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == icesp1116, responsible for erm(b)-mediated, inducible erythromycin resistance in  streptococcus pyogenes, was comprehensively characterized, and its chromosomal integration site was determined. it displayed a unique mosaic organization consisting of a scaffold, related to tngallo1 from streptococcus gallolyticus, with two inserted fragments separated by is1216. one fragment, containing erm(b), displayed high-level identity to a portion of the s. pyogenes plasmid psm19035; the other, containing a truncated tet(m) gene, displayed high-level identity to the right-hand portion of clostridium difficile tn5397.
