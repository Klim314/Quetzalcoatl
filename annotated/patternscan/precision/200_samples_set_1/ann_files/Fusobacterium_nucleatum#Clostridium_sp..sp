TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  == examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. the specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; clostridium spp., 7%; and fusobacterium spp., 4%. bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (obg) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. members of the bacteroides fragilis group  accounted for 44% of all bacteroides spp., and of them, b. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. pigmented bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in obg infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in obg infections, abscesses, and wounds. the predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. the predominant strain was clostridium perfringens (48%). fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and obg infections. the predominant isolate  was fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). these data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.

TI  == in vitro activity of u-57930e against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-57930e, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. the mic (micrograms/ml) of u-57930e that inhibited 95% bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus prevotii, b. melaninogenicus and  p. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, b. vulgatus, propionibacterium and peptococcus species. clindamycin, on the other hand, gave mic values of 0.5 microgram/ml for b. fragilis, p. prevotii and p. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for propionibacterium sp. all strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of u-57930e. both clindamycin and  u-57930e showed similar mic values for all strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes tested. the mic values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and  tetracycline were within the expected range. u-57930e had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower mic than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  == twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 bacteroides sp (11 in the b fragilis group); four anaerobic gram-positive cocci; four clostridium sp; four propionibacterium acnes; and three fusobacterium sp. no aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. the gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to bacteroides organisms, four to clostridium  sp, and one to f nucleatum. the ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals  of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to peptococcus sp and two to  fusobacterium sp. five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by b fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by p acnes. the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). the early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.

TI  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel  and the rate of gas flow. cultures of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, c. septicum, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptococcus sp. and propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. all cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours  then incubated in a gaspak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared  to incubation only in the gaspak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
