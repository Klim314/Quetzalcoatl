TI  - Adaptation of the wine bacterium Oenococcus oeni to ethanol stress: role of the small heat shock protein Lo18 in membrane integrity.
AB  - Malolactic fermentation in wine is often carried out by Oenococcus oeni. Wine is  a stressful environment for bacteria because ethanol is a toxic compound that impairs the integrity of bacterial membranes. The small heat shock protein (sHsp) Lo18 is an essential actor of the stress response in O. oeni. Lo18 prevents the thermal aggregation of proteins and plays a crucial role in membrane quality control. Here, we investigated the interaction between Lo18 and four types of liposomes: one was prepared from O. oeni grown under optimal growth conditions (here, control liposomes), one was prepared from O. oeni grown in the presence of 8% ethanol (here, ethanol liposomes), one was prepared from synthetic phospholipids, and one was prepared from phospholipids from Bacillus subtilis or Lactococcus lactis. We observed the strongest interaction between Lo18 and control liposomes. The lipid binding activity of Lo18 required the dissociation of oligomeric structures into dimers. Protein protection experiments carried out in the presence of the liposomes from O. oeni suggested that Lo18 had a higher affinity for control liposomes than for a model protein. In anisotropy experiments, we mimicked ethanol action by temperature-dependent fluidization of the liposomes. Results suggest that the principal determinant of Lo18-membrane interaction is lipid bilayer phase behavior rather than phospholipid composition. We suggest a model to describe the ethanol adaptation of O. oeni. This model highlights the dual role of Lo18 in the protection of proteins from aggregation and membrane stabilization and suggests how modifications of phospholipid content may be a key factor determining the balance between these two functions.
TI  - Dynamics of lactic acid bacteria populations in Rioja wines by PCR-DGGE, comparison with culture-dependent methods.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria populations of red wine samples from industrial fermentations, including two different vinification methods were studied. For this investigation, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis was employed to supplement previous results that were obtained by culture-dependent methods. PCR-DGGE was aimed to study two targeted genes, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rpoB, and the results were useful to evaluate the microbial populations in wine samples. Moreover, an improvement of a detection limit determined so far for DGGE analysis was obtained with the method described in this study, what made possible to identify lactic acid bacteria populations below 10(1) colony-forming unit/mL. The species Oenococcus oeni was the most frequently detected bacterium, but identifications close to species Oenococcus kitaharae and Lactococcus lactis that are not often found in wine were firstly identified in samples of this research. PCR-DGGE allowed to detect 9 out of 11 lactic acid bacteria species identified in this study (nine by PCR-16S rDNA/DGGE and four by PCR-rpoB/DGGE), while five species were detected using the modified de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar. Therefore, the two methods were demonstrated to be complementary. This finding suggests that analysis of the lactic acid bacteria population structure in wine should be carried out using both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques with more than one primer pair.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  - This is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. Several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. Overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-Proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. Further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. In addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. The bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with methods that took all reads into account. The metagenomic sequencing analysis identified Hanseniaspora uvarum, Hanseniaspora opuntiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. Also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as Erwinia tasmaniensis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Oenococcus oeni). Furthermore, the sequence reads associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by Myoviridae and Siphoviridae, and reflecting Lactobacillus as the dominant host. To conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from musts and wines of three consecutive vintages of Ribeira Sacra.
AB  - AIMS: This study was designed to isolate and characterize the lactic acid microbiota of the musts and wines of a young denomination of origin area, Ribeira Sacra in north-west Spain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over three consecutive years (2007, 2008 and 2009), we examined musts and wines from four cellars in different zones of the region. Through biochemical and genetic tests, 459 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were identified as the following species: Lactobacillus alvei (0.7%), Lactobacillus brevis (1.7%), Lactobacillus frumenti (0.9%), Lactobacillus kunkeei (12%), Lactobacillus plantarum (6.5%), Lactobacillus pentosus (0.9%), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (3%), Leuconostoc citreum (0.7%), Leuconostoc fructosum (synon. Lactobacillus fructosum) (3.7%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides (2.8%), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (0.2%), Oenococcus oeni (59%), Pediococcus parvulus (7%) and Weisella paramesenteroides (synon. Leuconostoc paramesenteroides) (0.9%). Of these species, O. oeni was the main one responsible for malolactic fermentation (MLF) in all cellars and years with the exception of Lact. plantarum, predominant in 2007, in one cellar, and Lact. brevis, Lact. frumenti and Ped. parvulus coexisting with O. oeni in one cellar in 2009. Different strains (84) of LAB species (14) were identified by biochemical techniques (API strips, the presence of plasmids, enzyme activities and MLF performance) and molecular techniques (PCR). All assays were carried out with every one of the 459 isolates. To select candidates for use as culture starters, we assessed malolactic, beta-glucosidase and tannase activities, the presence of genes involved in biogenic amine production and plasmid content. CONCLUSIONS: A high diversity of LAB is present in the grape musts of Ribeira Sacra but few species are responsible for MLF; however, different strains of such species are involved in the process. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of Lact. frumenti thriving in wine. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Information on LAB populations in must and wine is presented. A large collection of well-characterized strains of LAB are available as starter cultures to winemakers.
TI  - Tolerance to high osmolality of the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni and identification of potential osmoprotectants.
AB  - Growth of the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni under hyperosmotic constraint was investigated in a chemically defined medium. The bacterium could grow on media with an elevated osmolality, preferably below 1.5 Osm kg(-)(1) H(2)O. At osmolalities comprised between 0.6 and 1.5 Osm kg(-)(1) H(2)O, the growth deficit elicited by the sugars glucose and fructose was slightly more severe than with salts (NaCl or KCl). In contrast to what was observed in other lactic acid bacteria, proline, glycine betaine and related molecules were unable to relieve inhibition of growth of O. oeni under osmotic constraint. This was correlated to the absence of sequences homologous to the genes coding for glycine betaine and/or proline transporters described in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. The amino acid aspartate proved to be osmoprotective under electrolyte and non-electrolyte stress. Examination of the role of peptides during osmoregulation showed that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides were protective under salt-induced stress, and not under sugar-induced stress. Under high salt, PepQ a cytoplasmic prolidase that specifically liberated proline from di-peptides increased activity, while PepX (X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase) and PepI (iminopeptidase) activities were unaffected. Our data suggest that proline- and glutamate-containing peptides may contribute to the adaptation of O. oeni to high salt through their intracellular hydrolysis and/or direct accumulation.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Heterologous expression of bacterial and human multidrug resistance proteins protect Escherichia coli against mercury and zinc contamination.
AB  - In order to determine the role of multidrug resistance proteins in mercury and zinc resistance, human MDR1, Lactococcus lactis lmrA, and Oenococcus oeni omrA genes were expressed in an Escherichia coli tolC mutant which is hypersensitive to metals. The three transporters conferred an increased mercury and zinc resistance to E. coli as compared to the control bacteria. This improved resistance correlated with a decreased zinc and mercury bioaccumulation. Indeed, quantification of intracellular metal concentrations by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) showed a 2.1-, 3-, and 5.1-fold decrease in zinc in cells expressing hMDR1, omrA, and lmrA, respectively, and a 2.7-, 7.5-, and 7.7-fold decrease in mercury in cells expressing omrA, lmrA, and hMDR1, respectively, as compared to the control bacteria. This means that hMDR1, LmrA, and OmrA proteins which are specialised in xenobiotic scavenging, their main known function, are nevertheless able to confer some resistance against metals. Our results show that the tolC mutated strain is well adapted to the study of MDR transporter activity and could be used to screen substrates and competitive hMDR1 inhibitors.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the malolactic gene of Pediococcus damnosus NCFB1832 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - Wine production is characterized by a primary alcoholic fermentation, conducted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, followed by a secondary malolactic fermentation (MLF). Although most lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the ability to metabolize L-malate, only a few species survive the high ethanol and SO2 levels in wine. Wines produced in colder viticultural regions have a lower pH than wines produced in warmer regions. The decarboxylation of L-malate in these wines leads to an increase in pH, more organoleptic complexity and microbiological stability. MLF is, however, difficult to control and problems often occur during filtering of such wines. Pediococcus spp. are known to occur in high pH wines and have strong malolactic activity. However, some pediococci synthesize exocellular polysaccharides, which may lead to abnormal viscosity in wine. In this study, the malolactic gene from Pediococcus damnosus NCFB1832 (mleD) was cloned into S. cerevisiae and co-expressed with the malate permease gene (mae1) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of the mleD gene was compared to the expression of two other malolactic genes, mleS from Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and mleA from Oenococcus oeni Lal1. The genetically modified strain of S. cerevisiae decreased the level of L-malate in grape must to less than 0.3 gl(-1) within 3 days. This is the first expression of a malolactic gene from Pediococcus in S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Heterologously expressed bacterial and human multidrug resistance proteins confer cadmium resistance to Escherichia coli.
AB  - The human MDR1 gene is induced by cadmium exposure although no resistance to this metal is observed in human cells overexpressing hMDR1. To access the role of MDR proteins in cadmium resistance, human MDR1, Lactococcus lactis lmrA, and Oenococcus oeni omrA were expressed in an Escherichia coli tolC mutant strain which proved to be hypersensitive to cadmium. Both the human and bacterial MDR genes conferred cadmium resistance to E. coli up to 0.4 mM concentration. Protection was abolished by 100 microM verapamil. Quantification of intracellular cadmium concentration by atomic absorption spectrometry showed a reduced cadmium accumulation in cells expressing the MDR genes. Inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis overexpressing lmrA displayed an ATP-dependent (109)Cd(2+) uptake that was stimulated by glutathione. An evolutionary model is discussed in which MDR proteins have evolved independently from an ancestor protein displaying both organic xenobiotic- and divalent metal-extrusion abilities.
TI  - Diversity in the lysis-integration region of oenophage genomes and evidence for multiple tRNA loci, as targets for prophage integration in Oenococcus oeni.
AB  - The central genomic regions of Oenococcus oeni phages fOg30 and fOgPSU1 have been compared with the equivalent regions of oenophages fOg44 and phi 10MC. In all cases, an almost identical endolysin gene was followed by one of two orfs, encoding putative holins (orf117 and orf163). The fOg44 endolysin was established as a secretory protein when expressed in Lactococcus lactis. Orf117 (from fOg44) promoted lysis of Escherichia coli cultures upon induction of a defective lambda Sam7 prophage, but Orf163 (from fOg30) failed to elicit a lysis response in this system. fOg44 and fOgPSU1 were shown to integrate at the 3' end of a tRNA(Glu) and a tRNA(Lys), respectively. Searching the available sequence of the O. oeni MCW genome for attP-like elements, two other tRNA targets could be proposed for prophage establishment. Between the lysis and integration elements, a diverse cluster of genes (absent in phi 10MC) was observed. One common gene in this "lysogenic conversion cluster" was experimentally confirmed as a transcriptional repressor, affecting the expression of a putative permease gene.
TI  - A new vector, pGID052, for genetic transfer in Oenococcus oeni.
AB  - Despite the large number of techniques available for the transformation of bacteria, several species are still resistant to the introduction of foreign DNA. Oenococcus oeni are among the organisms that are particularly refractory to transformation. However, conjugal experiments from Lactococcus lactis to O. oeni with a new plasmid, pGID052, were performed via mobilization with success. This plasmid, a derivative of pORI19, encompasses: (i) the oriT of pIP501, which permitted the transfer to O. oeni, (ii) the replication genes of a native Leuconostoc citreum plasmid. Frequencies of 10(-7) conjugants per recipient were found. The transfer did not affect the structure of this low-copy-number plasmid. Moreover, pGID052 seems segregationally stable and could be used in the future as an expression vector.
TI  - A bacterial gene homologous to ABC transporters protect Oenococcus oeni from ethanol and other stress factors in wine.
AB  - The wine lactic acid bacteria Oenococcus oeni has to cope with harsh environmental conditions including an acidic pH, a high alcoholic content, non-optimal growth temperatures, and growth inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic acids and tannins. We here describe characterisation and cloning of the O. oeni omrA gene encoding a protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters. The OmrA protein displays the highest sequence similarity with the subfamily of ATP-dependent multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, most notably the bacterial Lactococcus lactis LmrA homologue of the human MDR1 P-glycoprotein. The omrA gene proved to be a stress-responsive gene since its expression was increased at high temperature or under osmotic shock. The OmrA protein function was tested in Escherichia coli, and consistent with the omrA gene expression pattern, OmrA conferred protection to bacteria grown on a high salt medium. OmrA also triggered bacterial resistance to sodium laurate, wine and ethanol toxicity. The homologous LmrA protein featured the same stress-protective pattern than OmrA when expressed in E. coli, and the contribution to resistance of both OmrA and LmrA transporters was decreased by verapamil, a well-known inhibitor of the human MDR1 protein. Genes homologous to omrA were detected in other wine lactic acid bacteria, suggesting that this type of genes might constitute a well-conserved stress-protective molecular device.
TI  - Conjugative plasmid pIP501 undergoes specific deletions after transfer from Lactococcus lactis to Oenococcus oeni.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of plasmids pIP501 and its derivative pVA797 from Lactococcus lactis to Oenococcus oeni was assayed by filter mating. Plasmid pIP501 was transferred to a number of O. oeni strains whereas a single transconjugant of O. oeni M42 was recovered when pVA797 was used. Physical analysis of the transconjugant plasmids revealed that pIP501 and pVA797 underwent extensive deletions in O. oeni that affected the tra region (conjugal transfer) and SegB region (stability). All derivatives showed segregational instability in O. oeni, but were stably maintained in L. lactis. These differences correlated with the different plasmid copy numbers and the extent of deletions within the SegB region.
TI  - The ftsH gene of the wine bacterium Oenococcus oeni is involved in protection against environmental stress.
AB  - The wine bacterium Oenococcus oeni has to cope with harsh environmental conditions, including an acidic pH, a high alcoholic content, nonoptimal growth temperatures, and growth-inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic acids, and tannins. We describe the characterization and cloning of the O. oeni ftsH gene, encoding a protease belonging to the ATP binding cassette protein superfamily. The O. oeni FtsH protein is closest in sequence similarity to the FtsH homologue of Lactococcus lactis. The O. oeni ftsH gene proved to be stress-responsive, since its expression increased at high temperatures or under osmotic shock. O. oeni FtsH protein function was tested in an Escherichia coli ftsH mutant strain, and consistent with the O. oeni ftsH gene expression pattern, the O. oeni FtsH protein provided protection for the E. coli ftsH mutant against heat shock. O. oeni and Bradyrhizobium japonicum FtsH proteins also triggered E. coli resistance to wine toxicity. Genes homologous to O. oeni ftsH were detected in many other lactic acid bacteria found in wine, suggesting that this type of gene constitutes a well-conserved stress-protective molecular device.
TI  - Absence of malolactic activity is a characteristic of H+-ATPase-deficient mutants of the lactic acid bacterium Oenococcus oeni.
AB  - The lack of malolactic activity in H(+)-ATPase-deficient mutants of Oenococcus oeni selected previously was analyzed at the molecular level. Western blot experiments revealed a spot at 60 kDa corresponding to the malolactic enzyme only in the parental strain. Moreover, the mleA transcript encoding the malolactic enzyme was not detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of mutants. These results suggest that the malolactic operon was not transcribed in ATPase-deficient mutants. The mleR gene encoding a LysR-type regulatory protein which should be involved in expression of the malolactic genes was described previously for O. oeni. Results obtained in this study show that the mleR transcript was not detected in the mutants by RT-PCR. No mutation in the nucleotide sequences of the mleR gene and the malolactic operon was found. The effect of a reduction in H(+)-ATPase activity on L-malate metabolism was then investigated by using other malolactic bacteria. Spontaneous H(+)-ATPase-deficient mutant strains of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were isolated by using neomycin resistance. Two mutants were selected. These mutants exhibited ATPase activities that were reduced to 54 and 70% of the activities obtained for the L. lactis and L. mesenteroides parental strains, respectively. These mutants were also acid sensitive. However, in contrast to the ATPase-deficient mutants of O. oeni, activation of L-malate metabolism was observed with the L. lactis and L. mesenteroides mutants under optimal or acidic growth conditions. These data support the suggestion that expression of the genes encoding malolactic enzymes in O. oeni is regulated by the mleR product, as it is in L. lactis. Nevertheless, our results strongly suggest that there is a difference between the regulation of expression of the malolactic locus in O. oeni and the regulation of expression of this locus in less acidophilic lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - The N-terminal region of the Oenococcus oeni bacteriophage fOg44 lysin behaves as a bona fide signal peptide in Escherichia coli and as a cis-inhibitory element, preventing lytic activity on oenococcal cells.
AB  - The function of the N-terminal region of the Oenococcus oeni phage fOg44 lysin (Lys44) as an export signal was investigated. We observed that when induced in Escherichia coli, Lys44 was cleaved between residues 27 and 28 in a SecA-dependent manner. Lys44 processing could be blocked by a specific signal peptidase inhibitor and was severely reduced by modification of the cleavage site. The lethal effect of Lys44 expression observed in E. coli was ascribed to the presence of its N-terminal 27-residue sequence, as its deletion resulted in the production of a nontoxic, albeit active, product. We have further established that lytic activity in oenococcal cells was dependent on Lys44 processing. An active protein with the molecular mass expected for the cleaved enzyme was detected in extracts from O. oeni-infected cells. The temporal pattern of its appearance suggests that synthesis and export of Lys44 in the infected host progress along with phage maturation. Overall, these results provide, for the first time, experimental evidence for the presence of a signal peptide in a bacteriophage lysin. Database searches and alignment of protein sequences support the prediction that other known O. oeni and Lactococcus lactis phages also encode secretory lysins. The evolutionary significance of a putative phage lysis mechanism relying on secretory lytic enzymes is tentatively discussed, on the basis of host cell wall structure and autolytic capacity.
TI  - Comparison of partial malolactic enzyme gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis  of some lactic acid bacteria species and relationships with the malic enzyme.
AB  - DNA sequences covering 36% of the mle gene that encodes the malolactic enzyme were determined for 13 strains of lactic acid bacteria, representing Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus and Oenococcus genera. The sequences were aligned with the corresponding region of mleS in Lactococcus lactis. The phylogenetic distance matrix tree of all mle sequences was compared with the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. The analysis showed that the mle fragment evolved more rapidly than the 16S gene and differently. Pediococcus and Lactobacillus species were intermixed in the 16S rRNA tree whereas they were separated in the mle tree. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Oenococcus oeni were distinct from other species in the 16S rRNA tree, whereas they were intermixed with Lactobacillus species and Lactococcus lactis in the mle tree. The amino acid sequences deduced from partial mle genes were aligned with 22 malic enzyme sequences and the corresponding phylogenetic tree was constructed. Malic and malolactic enzymes were distinct at the phylogenetic level, except for malic enzymes of yeast and Escherichia coli which were nearer the malolactic enzymes than the other malic enzymes. The analysis of conserved sites showed several interesting amino acids specific to either malic enzyme or malolactic enzyme.
TI  - Physical map of the genome of Oenococcus oeni PSU-1 and localization of genetic markers.
AB  - A physical map of the chromosome of Oenococcus oeni PSU-1 was constructed. This represents the first map for a strain of this species. A total of 37 restriction sites for the rare-cutting endonucleases Ascl, Fsel, Notl and Sfil were mapped on the chromosome, which was found to be circular with an estimated size of 1857 kb. Fragment order was determined using several approaches: analysis of partial and double digestions, two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, isolation of linking clones, and Southern hybridization with labelled restriction fragments both from PSU-1 and from O. oeni strain GM. Oenococcal genes alsS/alsD, mleA and mir, two phage attachment sites and recurrent sequences such as IS1165-like elements and rrn loci were located on the physical map. Specific fragments hybridizing with gene probes from Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Bacillus subtilis were also identified. The two ribosomal operons have been precisely located and their transcription direction determined.
