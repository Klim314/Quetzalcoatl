TI  - Pneumonia in slaughtered sheep in south-western Iran: pathological characteristics and aerobic bacterial aetiology.
AB  - In this study, the lungs of 1,000 sheep carcasses were subjected to gross examination and those suspected to be infected with pneumonia were studied at histopathological level as well as examined for presence of bacteria. Pneumonia was detected in 42 (4.2%) carcasses. Based on histopathological lesions, 45.24% were affected with suppurative bronchopneumonia, 20.93% with interstitial pneumonia, 11.9% bronchointerstitial pneumonia, 7.14% with fibrinous bronchopneumonia and 2.38% with embolic pneumonia. In addition, 11.9% of the lungs showed lung abscesses and 2.33% were affected with pleuritis without involving pulmonary parenchyma. Bacteriological examination revealed presence of ovine pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida (24.53%), Staphylococcus aureus (20.75%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.09%), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (7.55%) and Actinomyces pyogenes (1.89%). The most common form of pneumonia was suppurative bronchopneumonia with moderate amounts of fibrin deposits on the pleural surface and inside the bronchioles and alveoli.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from dugongs (Dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in Queensland, Australia, 2000-2011.
AB  - Microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (Dugong dugon). This study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the University of Queensland's School of Veterinary Science for postmortem examination. Thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. The most abundant bacteria included Aeromonas spp., Clostridium spp., Vibrio spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas spp. In six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. Mixed infections containing Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp.; Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, and Serratia marcescens; and Actinomyces spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and Enterococcus faecalis was associated with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. Clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. The significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. It is also difficult to fulfil Koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. Regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.
TI  - Therapy of other bacterial infections.
AB  - Cutaneous bacterial disease continues to account for a significant proportion of  clinical visits. The continuing emergence of strains that are resistant to available antibacterial agents creates a challenge for dermatologists, who need to keep abreast of current treatment strategies. In this article, antibacterial regimens are presented for skin infections caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Neisseria, Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Pasteurella multocida, Vibrio vulnificus, Actinomyces, and Nocardia.
TI  - Otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  - Otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus Raillietia. Its prevalence is higher in mature and Zebu cattle. In advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. Ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory diseases and mixed infection. The principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as Actinomyces spp., Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus spp. and Mycoplasma bovis. The control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  - Parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha). Two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. All cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of PGF(2alpha). Out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (RFM). Each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (PP). Jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for PGF(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week PP and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks PP. From the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. From the 5th week PP, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 PP. Only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. From day 10 PP, ultrasonography (US) was performed every 3rd day until day 39 PP for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. The highest incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks PP. After the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. The species of bacteria found were Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and Pasteurella multocida. Immediately after parturition, very high levels of the PG-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 PP. Small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 PP in cows with RFM, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. Low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. In one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 PP, which was maintained until the end of the experimental period on day 46 PP. Based on US, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. In three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. Based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 PP. Results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after PG-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of RFM. Differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.
TI  - Pathological and microbiological studies on pneumonic lungs from Danish calves.
AB  - During 1 year, the association between microbiological and pathological findings  in 72 lungs from calves submitted to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory for diagnostic purposes was studied. All cases were evaluated pathologically and bacteriologically, whereas only 68 cases were examined for the presence of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3 virus) and bovine coronavirus, 62 cases for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD), 45 cases for bovine adenovirus and 51 cases for mycoplasmas. Based on histopathological examination, the cases were diagnosed as fibrinous and/or necrotizing bronchopneumonia, suppurative bronchopneumonia, embolic pneumonia and others. The diagnoses were based on the dominating and most severe lesions in each lung. Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Actinomyces pyogenes, P. haemolytica and BRSV were the most commonly found bacterial and viral lung pathogens, respectively. Pasteurella spp. and H. somnus were often associated with the more severe fibrinonecrotizing type of bronchopneumonia, whereas BRSV was primarily detected in cases of suppurative bronchopneumonia. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from one case only, whereas M. dispar, M. bovirhinis and Ureaplasma diversum were present, often concomitantly, in the majority of cases. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from one case.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological study of an otitis media outbreak in calves in a dairy herd.
AB  - On a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. The inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. The affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. Of the affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. Morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (October-December). Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), P. multocida from 20 (31.2%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. The exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to Pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. Most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal ear flora. On the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. After a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases. Possible preventive measures are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (H) versus unhealthy (UH) animals with respiratory signs. The prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract of H and UH Najdi sheep, Somali sheep and Holstein calves. The characteristics of Pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of Pasteurella haemolytica were identified in H and UH animals, Eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of UH Najdi and Somali sheep and Holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of UH sheep were Moraxella spp., Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in UH calves were Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinomyces spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of UH animals, namely Actinomyces pyogenes, Erysipelothrix spp., P. haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of the animals surveyed. Of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified P. haemolytica and P. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from UH as compared to those from H animals. These were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of P. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of P. multocida recovered from healthy animals. The only biotype of P. haemolytica isolated from H animals was biotype A, while both biotypes A (88.0% of the isolates) and T (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from UH animals.
TI  - Survey of free-ranging elk from Wyoming and Montana for selected pathogens.
AB  - From December 1991 through January 1995, a disease survey was conducted on herds  of free-ranging, hunter-killed elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) from three areas in proximity to Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming (USA), after tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis was discovered in a captive herd of elk in the area. Complete or partial sets of specimens from 289 elk collected between December 1991 and January 1993 were examined histologically; no mycobacterial lesions were observed. Lesions of tuberculosis were not detected in tonsils or lymph nodes of the head from an additional 99 hunter-killed, adult elk from one area (area 2) collected in January 1995. Neither M. bovis nor M. paratuberculosis were isolated from any of the specimens cultured. Antibodies to Brucella abortus were detected in serum samples from 0%, 1%, and 1% of elk from three areas sampled (areas 1, 2 and 3), respectively. Brucella abortus biovar 1 was isolated from multiple tissues from one seropositive animal from area 3. Larvae with morphology consistent with Dictyocaulus sp. were found in 12%, 14%, and 0% of fecal specimens tested from areas 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Pasteurella multocida and Actinomyces pyogenes were isolated from a lung with purulent bronchopneumonia and abscesses.
TI  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. A total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. Though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the 495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). In 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), Pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). Staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and Streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). Among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as S. suis, the major serotype was S. suis type 2 (35.4%). The remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). A total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.
TI  - Isolation of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria from feline subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  - A total of 113 specimens collected from purulent skin lesions of household cats was examined bacteriologically. Ninety seven isolates obtained from 74 specimens (65.5%). Of these, 11 specimens (9.7%) contained obligate anaerobes only, 18 specimens (15.9%) yielded both obligate and facultative anaerobes. In the obligate anaerobes detected, genus Fusobacterium was the most frequently observed and F. nucleatum was most common species. Pasteurella multocida was the facultative anaerobe which was most frequently detected.
TI  - Comparison of tilmicosin with long-acting oxytetracycline for treatment of respiratory tract disease in calves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of a single parenteral injection of tilmicosin with that of a single dose of a long-acting oxytetracycline as treatment in the early stages of naturally acquired undifferentiated respiratory tract disease in young dairy calves. DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial, randomized block design. ANIMALS: 40 dairy calves. PROCEDURES: 78 calves from 5 farms were examined weekly until 3 months old. When respiratory tract disease was diagnosed by a veterinarian, the calf was assigned to 1 or 2 treatment groups. Transtracheal wash samples were acquired to characterize the pathogens. The veterinarian, who was unaware of treatment assignments, examined calves for 3 days after treatment and evaluated severity, using a scoring system. Growth rates were measured. RESULTS: On the basis of response to initial treatment, relapse rates, and effect on growth rates, the antibiotics were determined to be equally effective. Severity of clinical disease was significantly (P < 0.03) less for the tilmicosin-treated calves on days 2 and 3 after treatment. Findings from analysis of transtracheal wash samples indicated Pasteurella multocida (25/40), P haemolytica (4/40), Haemophilus somnus (4/40), Actinomyces pyogenes (3/40), and Aspergillus sp (2/40). Mycoplasma was isolated in association with bacterial isolates in 22 calves. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tilmicosin and oxytetracycline are effective in treatment of respiratory tract disease in young calves, even when Mycoplasma spp are involved. Tilmicosin is more effective in resolving clinical signs. Early treatment of dairy calves with respiratory tract disease may decrease detrimental effects on growth.
TI  - Development of a peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique for the identification of Haemophilus somnus in pneumonic calf lungs in Denmark.
AB  - A peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique was developed for the identification  of Haemophilus somnus bacteria in lung tissues of calves. Antisera raised against somatic and wall antigens of a Danish and American strain of H. somnus were produced. Experimentally infected murine tissues were used for the determination of the sensitivity and specificity of antiserum that had been heterologously absorbed with antigens of cross-reacting bacteria, i.e. Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. None of the antisera reacted with Actinomyces pyogenes. An antiserum raised against somatic antigens of the Danish strain of H. somnus revealed the highest sensitivity in the PAP technique and became specific following absorption. Heterologous absorption also rendered this antiserum specific in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Subsequently, the PAP technique was applied on formalin-fixed pneumonic lung tissues of 86 calves. An immunodiagnosis of H. somnus pneumonia was obtained in 15 of 17 lungs from which the bacterium had been isolated. Moreover, immunostained bacteria were also demonstrated in 20 lungs from which H. somnus had not been isolated. Thus, application of immunohistochemistry significantly enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity of H. somnus pneumonia of calves and should be used as a potent supplementary tool for the routine screening of suspected lung tissues of calves from which bacterial isolation is negative.
TI  - [Main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern Cameroon].
AB  - Between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of Mycoplasma (M.): M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. ovipneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. sp. type D2 and M. arginini. Eleven Pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes A1, A3, A5, A7 and D2) and 11 Pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. Thirty-two antibiograms were performed on Pasteurella, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Actinomyces pyogenes strains. Eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin G and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. One Capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. Pest of small ruminants (PPR) virus was detected by immunocapture ELISA test performed on some lung samples. Two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats), between 1991 and 1993, and one for PPR (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the North and Far North provinces. No antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. Among the animals in the sample, PPR prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the Far North province and 14 +/- 3% in the North province. Concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated Pasteurella strains. PPR is endemic especially in the Far North province. The efficiency of a vaccination campaign against PPR must be estimated with a field survey.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from nasal and tonsillar samples of clinically healthy Rocky Mountain bighorn and domestic sheep.
AB  - Nasal and tonsillar samples were collected from 14 free-ranging clinically healthy Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) and 10 domestic sheep (Ovis aries). We identified 194 bacterial isolates, including 101 from bighorn and 93 from domestic sheep. Of these isolates, 115 were gram-positive and 79 were gram-negative. Staphylococcus species were the most numerous gram-positive organisms and had a higher incidence in samples from domestic than from bighorn sheep. In contrast Streptococcus species were present in higher numbers in samples from bighorn sheep. Pasteurella haemolytica, the most common gram-negative bacterium, was isolated from five of five tonsillar but from none of ten nasal samples of domestic sheep, and from seven of eight tonsillar and three of ten nasal samples of bighorn sheep. Most bacteria isolated were considered opportunistic pathogens. However, of the bacteria isolated, P. haemolytica, P. multocida, and Actinomyces pyogenes are most frequently associated with respiratory disease.
TI  - Chronic frontal sinusitis in dairy cattle: 12 cases (1978-1989).
AB  - Chronic frontal sinusitis in 12 dairy cattle most often was associated with a history of dehorning, in which the sinus was entered (67%), or with respiratory tract disease (25%). The most common organisms isolated were Actinomyces pyogenes and Pasteurella multocida. Signs of infection did not develop for months in some cattle and were often intermittent. The most common clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, fever, frontal bone distortion, exophthalmos, abnormal posture, nasal discharge, and neurologic abnormalities. Treatment consisted of trephination at 2 sites, drainage and lavage of the sinus cavity, and administration of antibiotics and analgesics. Eight cattle responded well to treatment and were discharged, but 4 others had signs of CNS involvement and died or were euthanatized. Trephination of the frontal sinus cavity at carefully chosen sites and antibiotic treatment are indicated when sinusitis is suspected. Drainage of the sinus cavity is imperative to avoid extension of the infection into the CNS.
TI  - A pathologic and bacteriologic study on otitis media in swine.
AB  - A pathologic and bacteriologic study on otitis media in swine was performed on 237 swine, ranging in age from 1 day to 1 year. These 237 swine from eight selected farms were slaughtered due to unfavorable prognosis associated with clinical signs of illness. One hundred sixty-three (68.8%) of the 237 swine were found to be affected with otitis, though only a few swine showed clinical signs characteristic of the disease. One hundred fifty-one (63.7%), 53 (22.4%), and 39 (16.5%) had lesions in the middle, external, and internal ear, respectively. Of the 151 cases with otitis media, bilateral and unilateral infection accounted for 114 (75.5%) and 37 (24.5%), respectively. Only 5/53 swine with otitis externa and 6/39 swine with otitis interna failed to show otitis media. All swine with infection in the tympanic cavity had inflammatory lesions in the auditory tube. Examination of the swine grouped by age revealed that, regardless of age, incidence of otitis media was 50-70%. In swine younger than 1 month old, otitis media tended to center on the auditory tube, where a mild infiltration of neutrophils into the mucous membrane was frequent. Thereafter, otitis media increased in degree and extent with age. Forty (26.5%) of the 151 swine affected with otitis media were accompanied by a substantial amount of inflammatory exudate in the tympanic cavity and bulla. Purulent exudate was found in 20/40 (50%) swine. Severe otitis media prevailed in swine between 1 and 4 months of age, showing inspissation of a suppurative exudate in the tympanic cavity and lysis of the underlying osseous wall of the tympanic bulla with subsequent fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - An abattoir survey of pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughter weight swine from 9 selected herds. IV. Bacteriological findings in chronic pneumonic lesions.
AB  - A total of 855 pig lungs were collected at slaughter and evaluated macroscopically. Bacteriological examinations were carried out on tissue samples from chronic pleuropneumonic lesions (n = 196) and from chronic bronchopneumonic lesions with suppuration (n = 14). Samples from normal lung tissue (n = 22) were also included. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from 54%, Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae from 11%, and Streptococcus spp. from 14% of the pneumonic lesions, respectively. From normal lung tissue P. multocida was isolated from 3 (14%) of the samples, A. pleuropneumoniae was not recovered and streptococci were isolated from only 1 (5%) of these samples. The above mentioned bacterial species were recovered either in pure cultures or mixed with various other microbes. A total of 109 P. multocida strains were further characterized by capsular serotyping and testing for production of dermonecrotic toxin. Ninety-nine (91%) of the strains were capsular type A 10 (9%) were type D. Out of the type A and the type D strains 94% and 90% were toxigenic, respectively. Most of the A. pleuropneumoniae strains were serotype 2. Strains of serotypes 1 and 7 were also identified. The majority of the streptococci were identified as either Streptococcus suis or Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from 14% of the lesions and anaerobic bacteria from 18%, respectively. The significance of the various bacterial species in relation to the development of chronic pneumonic lesions is discussed. Special attention is paid to P. multocida, and it is concluded that this bacterial species is probably of importance for the development of both types of chronic pneumonias.
TI  - The obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  - Samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. All mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. A mixed growth was obtained from all samples. The mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. Of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. Of the facultatively anaerobic species, Actinomyces (including A. viscosus, A. hordeovulneris and A. denticolens) comprised 12%, Pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and Propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. Clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates, Wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was C. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was P. multocida. These findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of selected veterinary bacterial pathogens to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and norfloxacin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin were tested for approximately ten clinical isolates of each of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus suis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Haemophilus parasuis, Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Rhodococcus equi, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar activity and were more active than norfloxacin. All isolates had an MIC of 1.0 microgram/mL or less for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, and these drugs had particularly marked activity against the gram-negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine. A sixteen month study.
AB  - A total of 349 isolates of Streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. Only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. Among typable isolates, serotype 2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). The majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. Forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure culture. Other isolates were found in conjunction with Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. Typable S. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. No obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of S. suis could be detected.
TI  - Survey of Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae infection in swine by different methods.
AB  - Lung and serum samples from pigs that died or were emergency-slaughtered in a pooled, conventional fattening herd were examined to survey Actinobacillus pleuro-pneumoniae infection and to compare the sensitivity of different testing methods. A total of 110 lungs were used for cultural isolation of the agent and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of impression smears. Boiled lung suspensions were tested by coagglutination (Co-A) and agar gel precipitation (AGP). Eighty-seven sera were tested along with lung samples from the same pigs. The lungs yielded a varied bacterial flora most often containing Pasteurella multocida and less frequently Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes, E. coli and Salmonella. A. pleuropneumoniae was isolated from 30 lungs: from 22 lungs it grew out in pure culture, from 7 as mixed culture with P. multocida and from 1 as mixed culture with A. pyogenes. The number of positive samples obtained by the different methods was as follows: coagglutination test (with boiled lung suspensions): 63 (57.3%); immunofluorescence: 43 (39.2%); AGP test (with serum): 31 (35.6%); AFP test (with boiled lung suspension): 25 (22.7%). A total of 23 samples (20.7%) were negative by all serological tests and by cultural isolation. Most samples gave positive results by two or more tests while 26 samples only by one test (most often, on 13 occasions, by the Co-A test). The Co-A test detected antigenic components of serotypes that have not been isolated in Hungary so far. This indicates that it is not enough to test one strain from a given lung sample: several colonies must be cultured and serotyped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of EL-870, a new semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - A new macrolide antibiotic, EL-870, 20-deoxo-20-(3,5-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)desmycosin, has been prepared by chemical modification of desmycosin. In vitro, against selected animal bacterial pathogens, it inhibited growth of Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Actinomyces pyogenes and certain other bacteria at levels of 6.25 micrograms/ml or less. In general, the MICs for Gram-negative enteric bacteria have been greater than 50 micrograms/ml. Concentrations equivalent to 4 X the MIC value were bactericidal for Pasteurella sp. EL-870 had other antibacterial properties which were characteristic of macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - [Phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. A complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom : Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces sp., Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a Gram- bacteria related to group II j. The pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. This kind of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
