TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == protective effect of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strain on infection with pathogenic bacteria in chickens.
AB  == the probiotic potential of a lactobacillus salivarius 3d strain isolated from chicken faeces was assessed in one day old chickens. lactobacillus salivarius 3d  was administered per os at a concentration of 10(8) cfu in 100 microl of pbs. the chickens were then challenged with pathogenic bacteria: salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium perfringens. samples of caecal contents and  livers were collected after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days after infection. lactobacilli  and pathogenic bacterial cell counts were determined in the samples. this study showed that l. salivarius 3d reduced the number of salmonella enteritidis and clostridium perfringens in the group of chickens treated with lactobacillus. therefore it may be concluded that l. salivarius 3d may be used as a potential probiotic for chickens.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

TI  == probiotic impact on microbial flora, inflammation and tumour development in il-10 knockout mice.
AB  == background: the enteric bacterial flora has been implicated in the pathogenesis of enterocolitis and colon cancer in c57bl/6 il-10 knockout mice. probiotic lactobacilli modify the enteric flora and are thought to have a beneficial effect on enterocolitis. we conducted a controlled feeding trial in il-10 knockout mice  using the probiotic lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius ucc118. aim: to determine the effect of probiotic consumption on the gastrointestinal microflora, tumour development and colitis in il-10 knockout mice. methods: twenty il-10 knockout mice were studied (10 consumed probiotic organisms in milk and 10 consumed unmodified milk) for 16 weeks. faecal microbial analysis was performed weekly to enumerate excretion of the probiotic ucc118, total lactobacilli, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides, coliforms, bifidobacteria and enterococci.  at sacrifice, the small and large bowel were microbiologically and histologically assessed. results: l. salivarius ucc118 was detected in faeces from all mice in the probiotic fed group, but not the control group. faecal coliform and enterococci levels were significantly reduced in probiotic fed animals compared to the controls (p < 0.05). at sacrifice, a significant reduction in c. perfringens numbers was observed in the test mice (p < 0.05). there were no fatalities in the test group compared to two deaths from fulminant colitis in the control group. only one test mouse developed colonic adenocarcinoma compared to five in the control group. test animal mucosal inflammation consistently scored lower than that of the control mice. conclusion: in this placebo controlled trial, modification of enteric flora in il-10 knockout mice by probiotic lactobacilli was associated with reduced prevalence of colon cancer and mucosal inflammatory activity.

TI  == effect of zinc bacitracin and salinomycin on intestinal microflora and performance of broilers.
AB  == a feeding experiment was carried out over 42 d with four groups of broiler chickens fed experimental diets formulated to provide no supplementation, 20 mg zinc bacitracin, 60 mg salinomycin, or both feed additives in combination. during the fifth week of the experiment, four chickens from each pen were killed, and the contents of gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ceca, and rectum were separately collected and pooled. in all intestinal segments, the ph and the concentration of lactic acid were measured, and the numbers of anaerobic bacteria, coliforms, lactic acid bacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens were counted. in homogenates of pancreas obtained from four animals, the activities of amylase, lipase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were measured. a significant growth-promoting effect was observed in the group receiving zinc bacitracin in combination with salinomycin. zinc bacitracin significantly reduced the number of coliform bacteria in the ileum and increased  the activities of amylase and lipase in pancreas homogenates. supplementation with salinomycin and zinc bacitracin, alone or in combination, resulted in significantly lower counts of c. perfringens as well as lactobacillus salivarius, which was a dominant lactic acid bacterium found in broiler intestinal contents.  high numbers of these lactobacilli may play a role in broiler growth depression related to competition in nutrient uptake or impaired fat absorption due to bile  acid deconjugation.

TI  == [studies on the composition of the fecal flora of healthy dogs with the special references of lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora (author's transl)].
AB  == with the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. it was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. the numbers of clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. the total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. the composition of the lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. in the feces of all age groups l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti with 9 different types were found. within the lactobacilli l. acidophilus type vi c, l. salivarius type vi a and l. fermenti type iv b were most frequently found. l. acidophilus types vi c and xi, l. salivarius types vi a and vi b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. b. adolescentis and b. pseudolongum consisted the main bifidobacterium flora.
