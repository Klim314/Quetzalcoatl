TI  - Nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in Japan.
AB  - The Japanese Three Academic Societies Joint Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance Committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. The surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. Patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between January 2011 and June 2012 were investigated. The collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected bacteria was measured at the Kitasato University Research Center for Infections and Antimicrobials. The surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Fusobacterium spp.). Bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. We compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. The age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. We were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant H. influenzae. We suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriology of deep neck infections: analysis of 634 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to review the bacteriology of deep neck infections (DNI) and identify the factors that influence the incidence of causative bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 634 patients with DNI was performed. Statistical analysis was used to compare the incidence of common pathogens in various conditions such as age of the patients, aetiology and associated diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated in 514 cultures (81%). Aerobic bacteria were isolated from 246 cultures (39%) and anaerobic bacteria from 61 cultures (10%). Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 207 cultures (32%). The most common aerobic bacteria were Streptococcus pyogenes (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (32%). The most common anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (28%), followed by Prevotela species (8%) and Proprionibacterium species (7%). The incidence of anaerobic bacteria was higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriology of DNI is polymicrobial, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The incidence of anaerobic bacteria is higher in adults, in patients with infections of dental origin and in non-diabetic patients.
TI  - Endoscopically-derived bacterial cultures in chronic rhinosinusitis: A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Culture-directed antibiotic therapy represents an important component in the management paradigm of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to assess culture yield of the most common aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. METHODS: A total of 43 studies between 1975 and 2010 were included. RESULTS: The composite data comprised 3528 patients with 6005 total culture specimens. The cultures were obtained in operating room in 33 (76.7%) and clinic in 10 (23.3%) of the studies, respectively. The most common site of culture was the maxillary sinus in 18 (41.9%) of the studies. The most common assay techniques reported were swab in 19 (44.2%) and aspirate in 12 (27.9%) studies. The most common gram positive aerobes reported were coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in 630 (34.7%) and 481 (26.5%) of the cultures, respectively. The most common gram negative aerobes included Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 245 (27.0%) and 198 (21.6%) cultures, respectively. The most common anaerobes reported were Peptostreptococcus species in 156 (19.6%) and Bacteroides species in 153 (19.2%) cultures. CONCLUSION: This study provides a composite snapshot of the literature accrued on the microbiology of CRS. It should serve to apprise clinicians on the most common aerobic and anaerobic organisms in CRS patients when employing culture-directed antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Oral microbiocenosis features of diabetic patients after orthopedic treatment with various types of crowns].
AB  - The article gives a detailed analysis of oral cavity microbiocenosis features of  36 patients with type II diabetes for 5 years. These data reflects microbiocenosis features before and after orthopedic treatment with metal-ceramic and pressed crowns. These results indicate that frequency of occurrence and the number of microorganisms of the genus Streptococcus, Staphylococcus (including S. aureus), Peptostreptococcus and Candida is significantly higher in patients after orthopedic treatment with pressed crowns than with metal-ceramic crowns. A high percentage of normal microflora, particularly lactobacilli (60%), was revealed on gingival mucosa in patients after orthopedic treatment with metal-ceramic crowns.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of head and neck space infections of odontogenic origin.
AB  - This paper aim to assess the anatomical spaces of head and neck region and causative microorganisms responsible for infections, evaluate the resistance of antibiotics used in treatment and compare the findings with previously reported microbial flora in the orofacial infection. Forty-two patients were recorded. All underwent surgical incision and drainage, received antibiotics cover, and had culture and sensitivity test performed for gram positive and gram negative aerobes. There were 33 male (78.57 %) and 9 female (21.42 %). Out of the 42 patients 28 (66.66 %) presented with single space involvement. The submandibular space was the most frequent location for single space abscess (28.12 %). Fourteen patients presented with multiple space involvement, with a total of 64 spaces being involved. Forty microorganisms were isolated. There were 28 aerobes and 10 anaerobes. Two fungi were also identified. The most common bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus. The key issue here, which needs to be remembered, is that antibiotics alone cannot resolve odontogenic infection satisfactorily. Quick recovery of patients results with proper basic management comprising of early drainage/decompression which is equally important.
TI  - A safe and practical decontamination method to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of ultrasound transducers.
AB  - PURPOSE: Hospital-acquired infections is a major concern affecting patient management, in which medical instruments and devices play an important role. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of bacterial contamination of the sonographic probe and describe an effective, safe, and practical decontamination method. METHODS: The study's sample consisted of 50 patients. Cultures were taken from the probe surface both after each examination and after the probes had been wiped clean with a dry, nonsterile paper towel. Cultures were also taken randomly from the coupling gel. RESULTS: Initial cultures were positive in 49 cases (98%) for aerobic and in 26 cases (52%) for anaerobic bacteria. Cultures obtained after cleaning the probe were positive in only 21 cases (42%) for aerobic and in 12 cases (24%) for anaerobic bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated in the aerobic cultures were Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and in the anaerobic cultures were Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. All cultures taken from the coupling gel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic probes may act as a medium for bacterial contamination and transmission. Cleaning of the probe with a dry, nonsterile paper towel is an easy, effective, low-cost, and device-friendly method that can reduce this risk.
TI  - Diagnosis of gas gangrene: does a discrepancy exist between the published data and practice.
AB  - The Infectious Disease Society of America has defined gas gangrene as an infection caused by Clostridium species. However, in many clinical settings, soft tissue infections that produce subcutaneous gas have been diagnosed as gas gangrene without identification of the presence of Clostridium species. Instead, the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic findings. A chart review was performed of 25 consecutive patients treated at the Atlantic Health System for infections of the lower extremity that were diagnosed as gas gangrene. Wound cultures from the 25 patients grew 31 different species of bacteria. The most prevalent organism was Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 17 of 31 (54.84%) different organisms identified and 19.77% of 86 separate aerobic or anaerobic cultures. The most prevalent genus was Streptococcus, which accounted for 20 (64.52%) of the organisms identified and 23.26% of the cultures. The most prevalent anaerobic genus was Peptostreptococcus, which accounted for 8 (25.81%) of the organisms identified and 9.3% of the cultures. None of the cultures grew Clostridium species. These findings showed that gas-forming soft tissue infections of the lower extremity, commonly diagnosed as gas gangrene, are rarely caused by Clostridium species.
TI  - In vivo proton MR spectroscopy in uterine abscesses.
AB  - It is important to make a rapid diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment, however, specific diagnosis of causative organisms of pelvic abscesses on conventional MR imaging is difficult. MR spectroscopy provides metabolic information noninvasively, and has the potential to characterize etiology of the abscesses. The presence of acetate (Ac) peak with or without succinate (Suc) peak may suggest anaerobic bacterial infection, whereas the absence of Ac and Suc peaks in the spectra may suggest aerobic infection. This report describes two cases of uterine pyogenic abscesses, which showed Ac and Suc peaks on in vivo MR spectroscopy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  - Immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. Arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. Direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. We now report a general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. The recombinant proteins have a C-terminal CVIX protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. This approach offers several advantages. The recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. Complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins A, G, and L and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with PBST buffer at pH 7.2. However, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 M glycine.HCl buffer, pH 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with PBS buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 degrees C overnight. The recombinant forms of proteins A, G, and L can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.
TI  - Incorporating into a Calpha Go model the effects of geometrical restriction on Calpha atoms caused by side chain orientations.
AB  - Coarse-grained Go models have been widely used for studying protein-folding mechanisms. Despite the simplicity of the model, these can reproduce the essential features of the folding process of a protein. However, it is also known that side chains significantly contribute to the folding mechanism. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate the side chain effects into a coarse-grained Go model. In this study, to distinguish the effects of side chain orientation and to understand how these effects contribute to folding mechanisms, we incorporate into a Calpha Go model not only heterogeneous contact energies but also geometrical restraints around two Calpha atoms in contact with each other. We confirm that the heterogeneity of contact energies governs the folding pathway of a protein and that the geometric constraints attributed to side chains reproduce cooperative transitions in folding.
TI  - [V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. We report on our first experience and applications of V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: V. A. C. INSTILL therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. Three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 MRSA, 1 Finegoldia magna). In 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 Streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with MRSA among others) and after pneumectomy (1 MRSA) were detected. In 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). In 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with MRSA infection was treated. Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. In all cases instillation of the wound was performed with Lavasept 0.2 %. Swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy as well as before wound closure. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. Instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. The duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. In 2 cases (1 MESA, 1 finegoldia) the V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy was repeated. In 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. All wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic osteomyelitis with MRSA infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for V. A. C. INSTILL(R) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. The material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. The aim of this in vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (MPT) or cast titanium (CPT) and zirconia abutments (Zc). METHODS: Six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. The study was conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. Each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. Participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. RESULTS: Pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria mucosa, Porphyromonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobios, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (P > 0.05). All the other target species presented significant differences sought by Friedman test (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. CPT presented the higher mean counts, followed by MPT and Zc. CPT group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than MPT and Zc. The anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  - Sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). The present investigation characterized microbial recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (AB) and nonabsorbable (NAB) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. AB and NAB sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. At explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. Suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. A significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (P < 0.05) was noted. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected devices. No significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. Biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (P < 0.042). We conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. Further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.

TI  - Infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following TKA. METHODS: This retrospective study of infected TKAs was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the Orthopedics & Traumatology Clinic of the Military Medical Academy (MMA) in Belgrade. A total of 654 primary and revised TKAs were performed in the said period. We registered and surgically treated 28 infected TKAs (primary TKAs: MMA--22, other institutions--6). The incidence of TKA infection in the MMA was 3.36%. The most common pathogens were: Staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and Staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. Other isolated pathogens were: Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneum., Klebsiella spp., Streptoccocus viridans, Seratia spp, Micrococcus luteus and Peptostreptococcus spp. In one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. We analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected TKAs. RESULTS: In our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. CONCLUSION: Two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected TKA, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. The antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.
TI  - Assessment of microbial diversity in biofilms recovered from endotracheal tubes using culture dependent and independent approaches.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Biofilm formation is one of the mechanisms through which the endotracheal tube (ET) facilitates bacterial contamination of the lower airways. In the present study, we analyzed the composition of the ET biofilm flora by means of culture dependent and culture independent (16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and pyrosequencing) approaches. Overall, the microbial diversity was high and members of different phylogenetic lineages were detected (Actinobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Candida spp., Clostridia, epsilon-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria). Culture dependent analysis, based on the use of selective growth media and conventional microbiological tests, resulted in the identification of typical aerobic nosocomial pathogens which are known to play a role in the development of VAP, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other opportunistic pathogens were also identified, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Kocuria varians. In general, there was little correlation between the results obtained by sequencing 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and by cultivation. Pyrosequencing of PCR amplified 16 S rRNA genes of four selected samples resulted in the identification of a much wider variety of bacteria. The results from the pyrosequencing analysis suggest that these four samples were dominated by members of the normal oral flora such as Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria. A combination of methods is recommended to obtain a complete picture of the microbial diversity of the ET biofilm.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Activity of a novel cyclic lipopeptide, CB-183,315, against resistant Clostridium difficile and other Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic intestinal pathogens.
AB  - We evaluated the activity of CB-183,315 against Clostridium difficile, including  strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and metronidazole and with elevated MICs to vancomycin as well as other Gram-positive intestinal pathogens. The MICs of CB-183,315 against all C. difficile isolates were </= 1 mug/ml. CB-183,315 had greater activity than vancomycin and metronidazole against C. difficile isolates and was more active than the comparators against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). CB-183,315 also had excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), other Clostridium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (GCF) cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. GCF samples were assessed with real-time PCR including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. RESULTS: Nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (S.D. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. Full-mouth bleeding scores (BOP) decreased from an average of 41.2% (S.D. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (S.D. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). Between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (S.D. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (S.D. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). Higher counts of Eubacterium saburreum, Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). During and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between BOP scores and bacterial counts were observed. BOP scores and GCF levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in GCF levels of the cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. Decreasing postpartum counts of Porphyromonas endodontalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of Il-8 and Il-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: BOP decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. Associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome. Postpartum associations between GCF cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.
TI  - Vulvar abscess: a retrospective review.
AB  - Vulvar abscesses can progress to cause significant illness requiring disfiguring  surgical debridement, broad spectrum antibiotics, and require hospitalization. A retrospective review of de-identified charts of 13 patients admitted for inpatient care for vulvar abscesses from 2004-2009 at West Virginia University Hospitals was conducted. Risk factors for vulvar abscess in these patients included obesity and diabetes. Body mass index (BMI) is directly proportionate to the size of the abscess and increased risk of intensive care unit admission. Most patients did not seek medical care prior to hospital admission. Polymicrobial infections were common, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was seen in two cases. The presence of multiple risk factors increased the length of hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware of these risk factors and initiate aggressive therapy for patients with elevated BMI or multiple risk factors.
TI  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis due to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis (PSO) is a rare syndrome. In adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (IV) drug abuse. The infecting organism in these patients is usually Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptostreptococcus species are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. Peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. Here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy Chinese man who was diagnosed with PSO and P. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. He was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. After additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the PSO was cured.
TI  - Recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinus fungal ball.
AB  - This case study with chart review describes the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of specimens obtained from 47 patients with Aspergillus spp fungus ball. Bacteria were recovered from 32 of the 47 (68%) patients. Eighty-six isolates, 29 aerobic and facultatives and 57 anaerobic, were recovered. Aerobic and facultatives only were recovered in 6 instances (19% of culture-positive specimens), anaerobes only in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 15 (47%). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5 isolates), Enterobacteriacae (4 isolates), and microaerophilic streptococci (4 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-negative bacilli (26), Peptostreptococcus spp (14), and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Twenty-two beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 15 patients. These included all 6 S aureus and 2 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, 4 of 10 of Fusobacteria, and 7 of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas. This study demonstrates the recovery of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in the sinuses of patients with fungus ball.
TI  - [Characteristics of microbiocenosis of gingival pocket in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis].
AB  - As a result of examination of 56 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis  (CGP) of a moderate severity and a severe form of the disease, microflora from gingival pocket in patients which severe form of CGP was established to have higher specific weight in index of dissemination of strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogencs, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium spp., anaerobic bacteria. Strains from patients with a severe form of CGP were characterized by a higher level of expression of the factors of pathogenicity and persistence. Associations of streptococci and staphylococci which the representatives of anaerobic flora such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus were more often revealed in patients with a severe form of CGP. Fact of microbial translocation from the gingival pocket was established: from the blood of the patients with CGP of a severe form, strains-translocants were cultivated by 4 times more frequently than from the patients with CGP of a moderate severity.
TI  - Microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  - PURPOSE: Advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. Recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. A prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. RESULTS: Upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. On determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and 18.8% were resistant. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. Aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. In this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. Our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. Sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (27) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (31) and Prevotella species (30). Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. Overall, 22 % of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. Vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics in alloplastic  total temporomandibular joint replacement surgery: a survey and preliminary guidelines.
AB  - PURPOSE: In 2009, the American Academy Of Orthopedic Surgeons recommended lifelong prophylaxis after orthopedic total joint replacement (TJR) before these patients undergo dental, aerodigestive, genitourinary (GU), and gastrointestinal (GI) procedures. Because oral and maxillofacial surgeons worldwide are implanting alloplastic total temporomandibular joint replacements (TMJ TJRs), it appeared reasonable to survey these surgeons to obtain data that might shed some light, not only on this issue, but also to obtain some data to begin to develop preliminary guidelines for the peri- and postoperative use of antibiotics for TMJ TJR using these results and the orthopedic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 surgeons worldwide, members of either the TMJ Concepts or Biomet Microfixation online networks were e-mailed a standard questionnaire surveying their perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics for their TMJ TJR cases. RESULTS: Of the 35 surgeons, 26 (74.2%) from 8 different countries responded. A total of 2,476 cases (3,368 joints) were retrospectively surveyed. Of the responding surgeons, 96.2% used, in order of frequency, cefazolin, clindamycin, cephalosporin, or penicillin-based antibiotics in the perioperative period and continued their use for a mean of 7 days (range 5 to 14) postoperatively. Also, 46.2% soaked the TJR components either in the perioperative antibiotic or in vancomycin, poviodine, gentamycin, or peroxide before implantation. In addition, 61.5% irrigated the wounds after device implantation with bacitracin, vancomycin, poviodine, peroxide, or the perioperative antibiotic. These surgeons reported that 51 joints (1.51%) had become infected within a mean of 6 months (range 2 weeks to 12 years) postoperatively. A total of 32 devices (0.95%) required removal and/or replacement. In cases in which the organisms were isolated, the organisms commonly associated with biofilm infection of TJR devices, Staphylococcus aureus, S epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus, and Pseudamonas aeruginosa, were cultured. In only 1 joint (0.003%) was there a suggestion of an association with an invasive dental/aerodigestive, GU/GI procedure. Regarding prophylaxis after TMJ TJRs and before dental/aerodigestive, GU, or GI procedures, 53.8% of the respondents reported that they provided prophylaxis. Of these, 1 recommended doing this for 6 months and 4 for 2 years, such as has been the American Dental Association/American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommendation since 2003; and 9 reported they believe these TMJ TJR patients should have lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental/aerodigestive, GU, or GI procedures. CONCLUSION: The evidence provided from the present small study survey and a review of the orthopedic data could provide the opportunity to develop guidelines for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic management for TMJ TJRs and spur additional research into this important area of patient management.
TI  - Microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  - Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. The most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis. Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Marginal zone B-cells, a gatekeeper of innate immunity.
AB  - To maintain the integrity of an organism constantly challenged by pathogens, the  immune system is endowed with a variety of cell types. B lymphocytes were initially thought to only play a role in the adaptive branch of immunity. However, a number of converging observations revealed that two B-cell subsets, marginal zone (MZ) and B1 cells, exhibit unique developmental and functional characteristics, and can contribute to innate immune responses. In addition to their capacity to mount a local antibody response against type-2 T-cell-independent (TI-2) antigens, MZ B-cells can participate to T-cell-dependent (TD) immune responses through the capture and import of blood-borne antigens to follicular areas of the spleen. Here, we discuss the multiple roles of MZ B-cells in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. We also summarize studies - performed in transgenic mice expressing fully human antibodies on their B-cells and in macaques whose infection with Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) represents a suitable model for HIV-1 infection in humans - showing that infectious agents have developed strategies to subvert MZ B-cell functions. In these two experimental models, we observed that two microbial superantigens for B-cells (protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus) as well as inactivated AT-2 virions of HIV-1 and infectious SIV preferentially deplete innate-like B-cells - MZ B-cells and/or B1 B-cells - with different consequences on TI and TD antibody responses. These data revealed that viruses and bacteria have developed strategies to deplete innate-like B-cells during the acute phase of infection and to impair the antibody response. Unraveling the intimate mechanisms responsible for targeting MZ B-cells in humans will be important for understanding disease pathogenesis and for designing novel vaccine strategies.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. Recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. The study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely Calcium hydroxide, Zinc oxide eugenol, Vitapex and Metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. METHOD: Microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. The microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using Agar diffusion technique. RESULTS: were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Facultative/Aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and Candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. ZOE showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by Vitapex, Calcium hydroxide and Metapex in descending order. CONCLUSION: Our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. In vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of any of the test filling material.
TI  - Normal bacterial flora from vaginas of Criollo Limonero cows.
AB  - In order to describe the normal bacterial flora in vaginas of Criollo Limonero cows, 51 healthy multiparous cows, at least 90-day postpartum, were selected. Duplicated swabs (N = 102) were taken from the vaginal fornix of cows to perform aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as conventional biochemical tests. Out of 102 swabs, bacterial growth was obtained in 55 (53.9%) while the remaining 47 (46.1%) did not exhibited any bacterial growth. Of the 55 bacterial growths, 23 (41.8%) were aerobic whereas 32 (58.1%) were anaerobic. Likewise, 29 (52.72%) of bacterial growths were pure and 26 (47.27%) were mixed. Under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, Gram positive bacteria were predominant (81.82% and 73.08%, respectively) over Gram negative bacteria (18.18% and 26.92%, respectively). Isolated bacteria were Arcanobacterium pyogenes (22.92%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.63%), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (17.71%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (6.25%), Bacteroides spp. (13.54%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (7.29%). In conclusion, normal vaginal bacterial flora of Criollo Limonero cows was predominantly Gram positive and included A. pyogenes, S. aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, E. rhusiopathiae, Bacteroides spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. In Criollo Limonero cattle, adaptive aspects such as development of humoral and physical mechanisms for defense, and bacterial adaptation to host deserve research attention.
TI  - Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis: a single-center experience and review of the  literature.
AB  - Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a serious and often fatal complication of long-term PD with severe malnutrition and poor prognosis. It causes progressive obstruction and encapsulation of the bowel. This retrospective study reviews our experience and that reviewed in the literature concerning EPS. It refers to a total of 1966 patients treated with chronic PD between 1974 and 2008. Twenty one of them (1.1%) developed EPS, with the incidence increasing with the duration of PD. Mean age of our patients with EPS was 43, ranging from 18 to 71 years, 8 were men and 13 women with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 21.6 kg/m(2). Only one patient had Type II diabetes, 15 patients had glomerular disease, and six of these 15 had an autoimmune disease such as Wegener's granulomatosis and SLE. Thirteen patients developed EPS while on PD, 7 within 2 years after transfer to HD, and only one after renal transplantation. However, 7 patients had a previous renal transplant before returning to PD and subsequently developing EPS. Interestingly, we did not observe more episodes of EPS after transplantation. In the patients who developed EPS, the peritonitis rate over the period of observation was 1/15.6 pt-months and was due to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and fungi. A history of peritonitis was not a prerequisite for developing EPS, since one patient had no episodes of peritonitis and 4 had just one previous episode. Fifteen patients presented with peritonitis within 4 months before the diagnosis of EPS with particularly virulent micro-organisms such as S. aureus, Candida, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and Peptostreptococcus. Eleven patients were treated with hypertonic dextrose solutions (4.25 g/dl of dextrose) and seven with icodextrin, indirectly suggesting problems with ultrafiltration. Nine of 21 patients were on beta-blockers. The diagnosis of EPS was made either surgically or radiologically with signs of small bowel obstruction in combination with severe malnutrition. Eleven of our patients (52%) had evidence of small bowel obstruction and 14 patients required total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Tamoxifen (10-20 mg daily) was started in 6 patients, 4 of whom are alive and 2 deceased 3 and 5 years after EPS was diagnosed. Of the 12 patients who were not given tamoxifen, 2 are alive and 10 died. No side effects of tamoxifen were reported. Only 7 of our patients (33%) died during the first year after the diagnosis of EPS. Currently, 4 patients are on HD and 3 have had a renal transplant. Six patients of the fourteen who underwent surgery (42.8%) died within the first 6 months after operation and five died after an average of 6.6 years, mostly due to cardiovascular causes, three are still alive. As EPS becomes more prevalent with longer duration of PD, large multicenter prospective studies are needed to establish its incidence and identify risk factors, therapeutic approach, and prognosis.
TI  - Microbiology of acute complicated bacterial sinusitis at the University of the Witwatersrand.
AB  - DESIGN: A retrospective chart review study at two referral hospitals identified 226 consecutive surgical patients with acute complicated sinusitis. SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty-nine male and 67 female patients, with a mean age of 16.5 (standard deviation 0.7) years, underwent external fronto-ethmoidectomy with maxillary sinus washout and 13 had a concurrent craniotomy. RESULTS: A total of 233 micro-organisms were isolated from 163 patients(72.1%), and 63 (27.9%) were culture-negative. Positive isolates included Streptococcus milleri (18.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.6%) and the anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus (6.4%) and Prevotella (4.7%) species. The prevalences of S. pneumoniae (2.6%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1.3%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.4%) were low. Polymicrobial disease was present in 56 patients (34.4%). There was a significant difference between the two hospitals in the prevalences of some bacteria (p<0.05). Antibiotic resistance was highest towards the penicillins (64.3%) and cephalosporins (12.5%). Effective empiric treatment was achieved with metronidazole and a choice of amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin plus cloxacillin or penicillin plus chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: The polymicrobial nature and severity of complicated sinusitis warrants a de-escalation approach to antimicrobial therapy. The combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole is a reasonable choice for initial empiric antibacterial therapy. Selection of drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with acute complicated sinusitis should be supported by knowledge of the local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Significance of cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected by endoscopic cannulation of the papilla of vater.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile analysis yields important information such as "biliary microlithiasis" and biliary tract colonization by microorganisms like Salmonella typhi or paratyphi, Escherichia coli, etc., which may progresses to cholelithiasis and have been found to have a role in the development of gallbladder cancer in India. AIM: To perform microscopic, cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with benign and malignant lesions of the gallbladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bile was collected from 48 patients by a catheter inserted through the cystic duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Direct microscopy and grading of crystals was performed. Smears prepared from centrifuged deposits were stained with Giemsa, Papanicolaou stain and Gram's stain for cytological and microbiological examination. Special staining for Helicobacter pylori was performed using Loeffler's Methylene blue and Warthin Starry stain. The rest of the sample was used for culture and complete microbiological examination. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had inflammatory lesions while 12 had malignant lesions. Crystals were observed in 93% of the cases, 13 (28.8%) had only cholesterol crystals, three (6.6%) had bilirubinate and 29 (64.4%) had both cholesterol and bilirubinate crystals. Smears from the centrifuged deposit mainly showed coccoid or cocobacillary bacteria on Gram's staining (81.3%). Five of 12 (41.6%) malignant cases showed epithelial atypia while none of the benign or inflammatory lesions showed such a change in hematoxylin and eosin and Pap-stained smears. Microbiologic analysis showed Staphylococcus aureus (14%), S. saprophyticus (5.5%), Peptococcus (5.5%), Peptostreptococcus (5.5%), Proteus mirabilis (5.5%), E. coli (17%), Enteorbacter cloacae (5.5%) and H. pylori (2.8%). CONCLUSION: Complete microscopic and microbiological examination of bile directly obtained from the common bile duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography yielded good results as fresh samples could be analyzed. It may help in diagnosis of many gallbladder lesions in early stages, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - The effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of  amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects on the nasopharyngeal flora of therapy of acute otitis media in children with either a low dose or a high dose of amoxicillin. DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: Of 50 children diagnosed as having acute otitis media, 25 received a low dose of amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) (group 1) and 25 received a high dose of amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) (group 2) for 10 days, and both groups were evaluated. INTERVENTION: Antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from the nasopharynx of 15 children in group 1 (60%) and 13 in group 2 (52%). The number of penicillin-susceptible isolates was equally reduced after both therapies. However, an increase was noted in the recovery of S aureus only in group 2 (from 2 to 6 organisms). A greater eradication rate of interfering organisms following therapy was noted in group 2 (from 86 to 36) than in group 1 (from 92 to 60) (P < .001). These organisms include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella species. CONCLUSIONS: The oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. These changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with S aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin.
TI  - [Experimental vaginal dysbiosis on the model of white laboratory mice].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of microbiocenosis of urogenital tract (UGT) of mice has been studied. When investigating UGT of mice in norm (n = 8), microorganisms of several genera with following occurrence frequency were detected: Lactobacillus (100%), Streptococcus (100%), Staphylococcus (87.5%), Micrococcus (12.5%), Bacillus (12.5%), Fusobacterium (87.5%), Peptococcus (62.5%), Peptostreptococcus (50%), Bacteroides (100%) and representatives of Enterobacteriaceae f (12.5%) family. A comparative analysis of UGT microflora in norm and under physiologically proceeding pregnancy helped to detect in the group of pregnant animals the increase of occurrence frequency of such conventionally-pathogenous organisms as representatives of Enterobacteriaceae family (6.86) and Peptococcus genus (1.37 times), representatives of Lactobacillus genus were found in 100% of animals. A possibility of UGT dysbiosis under microbialload made by the method of intravaginal introduction of 50 mkl of Staphilococcus aureus culture suspension which contains 1 x 109 cells/ml has been established. It was shown that clinical symptoms of dysbiosis (increase of pH, excretions at UGT outlet) correlate with disturbances in microbiocenosis of mice UGT which are characterized by a decrease of occurrence frequency and titer of saprophyte microorganisms, first of all, Lactobacillus (occurrence frequency decreased 15 times for anaerobic and 1.33 times for microaerophylic, and titers 1.32 times and 2.34 times, respectively), and by an increase of the titer of conventionally pathogenic bacteria, such as representatives of Enterobacteriaceae family (14.5 times) and Staphylococcus (6.17 times). Investigation of the effect of exogenic staphylococcal load on pregnancy has shown that the development of UGT dysbiosis affects the pregnancy result. Thus, it was established that there were three cases of abortion and two cases of natimortality which were registered in the group of female mice (n = 5) which were administered Staphylococcus after they became pregnant. The paper is presented in Russian.
TI  - Clinical features and prognostic factors of anaerobic infections: a 7-year retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. The clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. METHODS: The medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. Overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from lesions. Ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. The mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. The major pathogens by rank were the Bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by Clostridium spp. (11.8%), Prevotella spp. (9.4%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). Escherichia coli (17.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. The overall crude mortality rate resulting from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. Among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has a significant role in morbidity and mortality. Underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.
TI  - [Diabetic foot infections. Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of the causative microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot infections are a common reason for hospitalization and a cause of complications in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of microorganisms found on culture in complicated diabetic foot infections in hospitalized patients, and the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between December 2001 and December 2005 in our department, 84 samples in 62 diabetic patients with moderate/severe infection were collected for microbiological study. RESULTS: At least one microorganism was isolated in 88% of samples. The most frequently isolated germ group was gram-positive bacteria (55% of the samples), with Staphylococcus aureus (33%) in the first position, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Enterococcus spp. (9%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Culture for anaerobic microorganisms was only performed in half the samples; 25% were positive, and Peptostreptococcus spp. predominated. Among the multiresistant microorganisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococci aureus (MRSA) were the most common, accounting for 38% of the isolated strains of S. aureus, ie, 12% of all samples. As to the gram-negative microorganisms, nearly 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Most of the cultures in our study were monomicrobial, with S. aureus being the most prevalent microorganism, followed by enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa. The main resistant microorganism in diabetic foot infections requiring hospitalization was methicillin-resistant golden staphylococcus, which was found in 12% of the series.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - The bacteriology of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the bacteriologic findings in ethmoidal biopsy specimens and nasal lavage samples from healthy control patients and from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSNP+) and without nasal polyps (CRSNP-). DESIGN: Comparative microbiologic investigation. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: The study included 31 CRSNP+ patients, 13 CRSNP- patients, and 21 control patients. INTERVENTION: Aerobe and anaerobe bacterial culture of nasal lavage samples and biopsy specimens of anterior ethmoidal mucosa. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Analysis of biopsy specimens from 65 patients and nasal lavage samples from 63 patients. RESULTS: Mixed cultures of aerobe and anaerobe bacteria were mainly detected in the biopsy specimens. The most common aerobe bacteria found in the biopsy specimens were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium species, Staphylococcus aureus, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Propionibacterium and Peptostreptococcus species were the most common anaerobes. Pathogenic bacteria such as S. aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae were detected in biopsy specimens from 16 of 31 CRSNP+ patients (52%), 4 of 13 CRSNP- patients (31%), and 10 of 21 control patients (48%). There were no significant differences in the bacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens between the 3 patient groups (P >.30). The majority of bacteria detected in the biopsy specimens were also detected in the corresponding lavage samples; however, in 35% of patients, pathogenic bacteria were found only in nasal lavage samples and not in corresponding biopsy specimens. CONCLUSIONS: There are no significant differences in the bacteriologic features of ethmoidal biopsy specimens between CRSNP+, CRSNP-, and control patients. Therefore, a bacteriologic pathogenesis of the polyps in CRSNP+ patients seems unlikely. The general use of antibiotics in patients with CRS appears questionable. Investigation of nasal lavage samples is not suitable for predicting the bacteriologic features of inflamed sinuses of patients with CRS.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant obligate anaerobes during exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are thought to cause the majority of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, other bacterial pathogens may contribute to the pathophysiology of lung disease. Here, obligate anaerobes were identified in a cross-sectional study, and cell numbers and antibiotic susceptibilities of facultative and obligate anaerobes from 114 sputum samples from nine children and 36 adults with CF were determined. Furthermore, in 12 CF patients, we investigated whether conventional intravenous antibiotic therapy, administered during acute exacerbations, would affect the numbers of obligate anaerobes. Fifteen genera of obligate anaerobes were identified in 91% of the CF patients. Cell numbers (mean: 2.2 x 10(7) +/- standard deviation 6.9 x 10(7) CFU/mL of sputum sample) were comparable to those of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Staphylococcus saccharolyticus and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were most prevalent. Infection with P. aeruginosa did not increase the likelihood that obligate anaerobes are present in sputum specimens. Single obligate anaerobic species persisted for up to 11 months in sputum plugs in vivo. Patients with and without obligate anaerobes in sputum specimens did not differ in lung function. Intravenous therapy directed against P. aeruginosa during acute exacerbations increased lung function, but did not reduce the numbers of obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobic species differed widely in their patterns of resistance against meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftazidime. In 58% of patients with acute exacerbations, obligate anaerobes were detected that were resistant to the antibiotics used for treatment. Antibiotic therapy, optimized to target anaerobes in addition to P. aeruginosa, may improve the management of CF lung disease.
TI  - The role of anaerobic bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media in children: implications for medical therapy.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and medical management of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) in children highlighting the role of anaerobic bacteria. In studies that employed adequate method for recovery of anaerobic bacteria polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora was isolated from over half of the children with CSOM. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the most frequently isolated anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium spp. and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. Several studies illustrated the efficacy of anti-infective agents effective against anaerobic bacteria in the treatment of CSOM. The medical therapy of CSOM should be directed at the eradication of the pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Difficult intubation provokes bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteremia after mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation before induction of general anesthesia and to discover any correlation between traumatic manipulations and bacteremia. The specific bacteria responsible, knowledge of which may guide the prophylactic use of antibiotics, also were investigated. METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Three 10-mL blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein 10 min before induction of anesthesia, 10 min after mask ventilation, and 10 min after intubation. All samples were placed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles for culture and bacterial identification. RESULTS: Cultures received 10 min after intubation were positive in 12% of patients. The following strains were isolated: Escherichia coli in two cases, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. A strong positive correlation was found between difficult intubation and bacteremia. No correlation between bacteremia and easy intubation or between bacteremia and face mask ventilation was identified. CONCLUSION: Traumatic manipulations during difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation could cause bacteremia. This finding may justify and guide prophylactic use of antibiotics.
TI  - Polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic foot ulcer biofilm infections determined using bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic extremity ulcers are associated with chronic infections. Such ulcer infections are too often followed by amputation because there is little or no understanding of the ecology of such infections or how to control or eliminate this type of chronic infection. A primary impediment to the healing of chronic wounds is biofilm phenotype infections. Diabetic foot ulcers are the most common, disabling, and costly complications of diabetes. Here we seek to derive a better understanding of the polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic extremity ulcer infections. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a new bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach we have evaluated the bacterial diversity of 40 chronic diabetic foot ulcers from different patients. The most prevalent bacterial genus associated with diabetic chronic wounds was Corynebacterium spp. Findings also show that obligate anaerobes including Bacteroides, Peptoniphilus, Fingoldia, Anaerococcus, and Peptostreptococcus spp. are ubiquitous in diabetic ulcers, comprising a significant portion of the wound biofilm communities. Other major components of the bacterial communities included commonly cultured genera such as Streptococcus, Serratia, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we highlight the patterns of population diversity observed in the samples and introduce preliminary evidence to support the concept of functional equivalent pathogroups (FEP). Here we introduce FEP as consortia of genotypically distinct bacteria that symbiotically produce a pathogenic community. According to this hypothesis, individual members of these communities when they occur alone may not cause disease but when they coaggregate or consort together into a FEP the synergistic effect provides the functional equivalence of well-known pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, giving the biofilm community the factors necessary to maintain chronic biofilm infections. Further work is definitely warranted and needed in order to prove whether the FEPs concept is a viable hypothesis. The findings here also suggest that traditional culturing methods may be extremely biased as a diagnostic tool as they select for easily cultured organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and against difficult to culture bacteria such as anaerobes. While PCR methods also have bias, further work is now needed in comparing traditional culture results to high-resolution molecular diagnostic methods such as bTEFAP.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Moraxella catarrhalis-dependent tonsillar B cell activation does not lead to apoptosis but to vigorous proliferation resulting in nonspecific IgM production.
AB  - The respiratory pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis has a high affinity for human IgD  and is mitogenic for peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Moraxella IgD-binding protein, which is a multifunctional outer membrane protein with adhesive properties, is responsible for the interaction. Previous experiments with the Ig-binding B cell superantigens protein A and protein L from Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus magnus, respectively, have suggested that nonimmune BCR cross-linking induces B cell apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. The goal of this study was to characterize early and late B cell events in the presence of M. catarrhalis in comparison with S. aureus. Despite an increased phosphatidyl serine translocation as revealed by Annexin V binding in flow cytometry analyses, neither M. catarrhalis nor S. aureus induced activation-associated apoptotic cell death in purified human tonsillar B cells. In contrast, a vigorous B cell proliferation, as quantified using thymidine incorporation and CFSE staining, was observed. An increased expression of an array of surface proteins (i.e., CD19, CD21, CD40, CD45, CD54, CD69, CD86, CD95, and HLA-DR) and IgM production was found upon activation with M. catarrhalis. In conclusion, M. catarrhalis-dependent B cell activation does not result in apoptosis but in cell division and nonspecific IgM synthesis, suggesting that the bacterial interaction with tonsillar B cells serves to redirect the early adaptive immune response.
TI  - Deep neck abscess: an analysis of microbial etiology and the effectiveness of antibiotics.
AB  - The objective was to demonstrate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of deep neck space abscess and to analyze the coverage rate of different empiric antimicrobial agents. A retrospective review of hospitalized patients with deep neck abscess diagnosed at a tertiary-care, general hospital between April 2001 and October 2006. The study enrolled 100 patients. The bacterial cultures of 89 patients yielded positive results (89%). The predominant aerobes were viridans streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes included species of Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides. Five different combinations of empiric antibiotics, namely regimen 1: penicillin G and clindamycin and gentamicin, regimen 2: ceftriaxone and clindamycin, regimen 3: ceftriaxone and metronidazole, regimen 4: cefuroxime and clindamycin, and regimen 5: penicillin and metronidazole, were compared using the antimicrobial susceptibility of 89 cases. The coverage rates of regimens 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 67.4%, 76.4%, 70.8%, 61.8%, and 16.9%, respectively. The coverage of regimen 5 was considerably worse than that of the other four regimens (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 was significantly better than regimen 4 (p < 0.001). Regimen 2 had better coverage than regimens 1 (p = 0.096) and 3 (p = 0.302), but the difference was not statistically significant. This study demonstrates the bacteriology of deep neck abscess and analyzes the coverage rate of different empiric antimicrobial agents. Regimens 1, 2, and 3 could be good candidates for empiric antibiotics. Pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted after the culture results are obtained.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - Middle meatus bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in patients after irradiation  of nasopharynx.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)  tend to suffer from rhinosinusitis because irradiation causes damage to sinonasal tissue; however, their bacteriology is lacking in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine the bacteriology and antibiotic resistance in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) of these patients. METHODS: We collected nasal purulent discharge for bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility tests in irradiated NPC patients with ARS. Middle meatus discharge was aspirated for culture with endoscopic assistance. RESULTS: A total of 33 episodes of ARS were documented in 25 patients. Staphylococcus aureus comprised 42% of all aerobes. Thirty-six percents of aerobic isolates were Gram-negative bacilli. Peptostreptococcus micros and Veillonella spp were the most frequently isolated anaerobes. CONCLUSION: The bacteriology in irradiated NPC patients with ARS was distinctive in the following: first, the most common pathogen was S. aureus; second, frequently isolated Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes; and third, polymicrobial infections. The beta-lactamase-producing pathogens were highly prevalent.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003 and march 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2005 to March 2006 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 384 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 161 (70.3%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and ninty-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 171 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary and postoperative infections. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. But cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum fl-lactamase was seen in 5.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that the increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and Bilophila wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. METHODS: Aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). The number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each). The predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), Peptostreptococcus spp (11), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological study of staphylococcus vaccine effects in periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of the staphylococcal vaccine inoculated subcutaneously in 15 patients with chronic periodontitis. Bacteriological investigation of samples collected from the periodontal pocket for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was performed by classic bacteriological procedures before and after vaccination. The following immune system parameters were evaluated: C reactive protein (CRP), serum level of C3 complement fraction, IgG, IgA, and IgM by immunodiffusion, PMN granulocytes ROS release after in vitro stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ) and Concanavalin A (ConA) by chemiluminescence assay and lymphocytes sets and subsets by flow-cytometry immunophenotyping. The microbiological investigations revealed high frequency of Staphylococcus spp isolation and the presence of the most common anaerobe agents incriminated in human periodontitis like Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella spp and the reduction of this flora in the periodontal pocket after therapy. The immunological parameters quantification showed the absence of CRP, normal values of C3, IgG, IgA, IgM in the majority of cases. All patients presented normal values of lymphocytes sets and subsets. Significant increase of PMN respiratory burst after ConA stimulation was observed before vaccination which turned to normal values after therapy and a low ROS level both before and after therapy suggesting PMN Fc receptors dysfunction in this group of patients. The data presented in our study suggest an immunomodulatory effect of staphylococcal vaccine therapy in periodontitis and high frequency of Staphylococcus spp recovering from the periodontal pocket of investigated subjects.
TI  - Exploitation of host signaling pathways by B cell superantigens--potential strategies for developing targeted therapies in systemic autoimmunity.
AB  - Some infectious agents produce molecules capable of interacting specifically with the immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions, independently of the conventional-binding site. They are referred to as B cell superantigens (SAgs) and include protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), gp120 of HIV-1, and protein L of Peptostreptococcus magnus (P. magnus). In contrast to conventional antigens, B cell superantigens interact with conserved framework regions of immunoglobulins and can target a large proportion of B cells. In experimental models, they have been demonstrated to deplete B cell subsets responsible for innate functions, namely B-1a and marginal zone (MZ) B cells. As a result, the interactions of these superantigens with host cells impair the humoral immune response. In addition to providing clues toward understanding host-pathogen interactions and microbial pathogenesis, B cell superantigens represent potential therapeutic agents that could be used to specifically modulate expansion of B cell subsets in diseased subjects. In systemic autoimmune diseases, for example, there is activation and expansion of B cells that secrete pathogenic autoantibodies. Their depletion results in clinical improvement in both experimental animals and patients. Currently, attempts are being made to specifically deplete pathogenic autoantibody-producing B cells. Since B-1a and MZ B cells have been found to be expanded in autoimmune disorders, B cell superantigens, used alone or in combination with other biological agents, may have beneficial effects in autoimmune disease management.
TI  - B cell superantigens subvert innate functions of B cells.
AB  - Some infectious agents produce molecules capable of interacting specifically with the immunoglobulin variable regions, independently of the conventional binding site. They are referred to as B cell superantigens, and include protein A of Staphylococcus aureus, protein L of Peptostreptococcus magnus, and gp120 of HIV-1. To test their effects in vivo, we used transgenic mice whose immunoglobulin loci were inactivated and their humoral immune system had been restored by introduction of human immunoglobulin loci. We found that administration of soluble recombinant B cell superantigens can deplete B cell subsets in vivo. They also preferentially impact B cell subpopulations responsible for innate-like functions. The studies indicate that certain pathogens have evolved primarily to subvert innate functions of B cells.
TI  - Sirolimus-associated chronic pyogenic periungual infection.
AB  
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with AECS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary AECS and chronic maxillary sinusitis. RESULTS: A total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. Aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). A total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with AECS. Aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and P acnes. Thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with AECS were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. However, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of AECS.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 645 strains including 17 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 226 (79.0%) of 286 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and seventeen strains were isolated from primary infections, and 345 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary infections followed by Bilophila wadsworthia. While the isolation rate of B. fragilis group was also the highest from postoperative infections, the following bacteria were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but not multidrug-resistant was seen in 13.3 per cents. Also cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase was seen in 7.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that an increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and B. wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Bacteriological study of paediatric and adult chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is one of the commonest illnesses in ENT  practice which requires medical attention all the more in children of poor socio-economic status having in past inadequate treatment and negligent medical care. The present study was conducted to find out the various aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms associated with CSOM in paediatric and adult cases and their current antimicrobial susceptibility pattern as a guide to therapy. Samples were collected from 109 clinically diagnosed cases of CSOM and processed according to standard protocols. Out of 74 paediatric CSOM cases, 72 (97.2%) were bacterial culture positive while out of 35 adult CSOM cases, 28 (80%) were culture positive. Bilateral CSOM was slightly more common in adults (25%) than paediatric (21.4%) age group. Polymicrobial nature of CSOM was noted in both paediatric (70.8%) and adult (71.4%) cases while number of organisms isolated per lesion was slightly higher in adults (2.5) as compared to paediatric (1.95) cases. In paediatric CSOM, Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest aerobic isolate while in adult CSOM, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest one. Among anaerobes Peptostreptococcus spp. was commonest in CSOM where as Prevotella melaninogenica in adult CSOM. Sensitivity of S. aureus to cefuroxime was 72.2% while that of gram negative bacilli was higher to cefotaxime (90 to 100%). Among anaerobes higher sensitivity was seen to metronidazole (98.6%), clindamycin (95.7%) and chloramphenicol (98.6%). In view of the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM, prompt appropriate antimicrobial therapy can effectively reverse the disease process thereby preventing longterm sequelae.
TI  - Bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We recommend amoxacillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins and macrolides  rather than penicillin as the first-line drug in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. In cases where there is no improvement of symptoms, cultures should be taken from the middle meatus, followed by appropriate selection of second-line antibiotics according to the sensitivity test results. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the causative bacteria and the antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of maxillary sinus aspirates from 81 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Aerobes were isolated from 58.0% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 48.1% of those from the maxillary sinus. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most prevalent aerobic pathogens. Anaerobes were isolated from 8.6% of the cultures from the middle meatus and from 18.5% of the cultures from the maxillary sinus. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus in adults but none of them were cultured in children. A high rate of concordance of the middle meatus and maxillary sinus was noted. Monomicrobial infection was most commonly observed. Ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates were cultured in 46% of the cases. Penicillin resistance rates were 93% for Staph. aureus; 25% of Strep. pneumoniae were intermediate and 25% were resistant.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Analysis of microbial etiology and mortality in patients with brain abscess.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the technological advancements in diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures, brain abscess continues to remain a potentially fatal central nervous system infection. In a prospective study we determined the predisposing factors and the microbiological profile of brain abscess. We also analyzed the mortality in patients with the type of infections identified. METHODS: Over a period of 8 years (1997-2004), aspirated pus from 118 patients with brain abscess was directly inoculated into BACTEC PLUS+ aerobic and BACTEC PLUS+ anaerobic media immediately after collection and subcultured on solid media as appropriate. Predisposing factors, if any, were recorded in all patients. Mortality of patients during hospital stay was correlated with the type of infections identified. RESULTS: Predisposing factors were identified in 94 (79.7%) patients, otogenic infection being the most common (37/118; 31.4%). Microorganisms were demonstrated in 96 (81.4%) patients, by culture in 89 (75.4%) patients and by Gram stain in 7 (5.9%) additional cases. A total of 105 organisms were isolated - 67 (63.8%) aerobes, 32 (30.5%) anaerobes, 5 (4.8%) mycobacteria and 1 (0.9%) fungus. Viridans streptococci (23.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), Bacteroides fragilis group/species and Peptostreptococcus species (10.5% each) were the common isolates. Overall mortality was 14.4%; patients with Gram-negative infections had higher mortality than Gram-positive infections (6/20; 30% vs. 6/63; 9.5%; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Culture of pus immediately after aspiration in an automated system yields good results. Gram stain coupled with culture can guide the neurosurgeons better to treat their patients more rationally. Patients with Gram-negative infections need special attention in terms of management because of high mortality rate.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of diabetic foot infections in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot infections are a frequent complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, accounting for up to 20% of diabetes-related hospital admissions. Infectious agents are associated with the worst outcomes, which may ultimately lead to amputation of the infected foot unless prompt treatment strategies are ensued. The present study sought to reveal the bacterial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers in South India, the diabetic capital of India. METHODS: A 10-month-long descriptive study was carried out to analyse the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates of all patients admitted with diabetic foot infections presenting with Wagner grade 2-5 ulcers. Bacteriological diagnosis and antibiotic sensitivity profiles were carried out and analysed using standard procedures. RESULTS: Diabetic polyneuropathy was found to be common (56.8%) and gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) were isolated more often than gram-positive ones (42.3%) in the patients screened. The most frequent bacterial isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), and Enterobacteriaceaes. Forty-nine cultures (68%) showed polymicrobial involvement. About 44% of P. aeruginosa were multi-drug-resistant, and MRSA was recovered on eight occasions (10.3%). Bacteroides spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were the major anaerobic isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the viewpoint put forth by previous South Indian authors that the distribution of gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) is more common than that of gram-positive ones (42.3%) and it is contrary to the viewpoint that diabetic foot infections are frequently monomicrobial. Furthermore, recovery of multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates is of serious concern, as almost no one has reported the same from the South Indian milieu.
TI  - Microbiology of intracranial abscesses and their associated sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the organisms recovered from infected sinuses and associated intracranial abscesses (IAs). DESIGN: Retrospective review of findings from aspirate of pus from 10 infected sinuses and their corresponding IAs. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients diagnosed as having sinusitis (age range, 7-58 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findings from infected sinuses and IAs. RESULTS: Polymicrobial flora was found in 9 sinuses and 8 IAs. Anaerobes were isolated from all sinuses and 9 IAs. A total of 26 isolates (2.6 isolates per specimen) were recovered from the sinuses: 19 anaerobic, 6 aerobic or facultative, and 1 microaerophilic; 17 isolates were found in the IAs (1.7 isolates per site): 13 anaerobic, 2 aerobic or facultative, and 2 microaerophilic. The predominant anaerobes were Fusobacterium species (in 5 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, 1 in a sinus only, and 1 in an IA only), Prevotella species (in 3 corresponding sinuses and abscesses), Peptostreptococcus species (in 2 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, and 4 in a sinus only), Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, microaerophilic streptococci, and Bacteroides ureolyticus (in 1 corresponding sinus and abscess each). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered 2 times, only from a sinus. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci group F were each isolated once from the sinus. Concordance in the microbiological findings between the sinus and the IA was found in all instances. However, certain organisms were present at only one or the other site. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the concordance in the recovery of organisms from infected sinuses and their associated IA and confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis and IA.
TI  - [Soft tissue infections in oral, maxillofacial, and plastic surgery. Bacterial spectra and antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region are mainly caused  by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli but also by members of the genera Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, respectively. METHODS: In a prospective study 96 patients with severe maxillofacial non-odontogenic postoperative soft tissue infections were analyzed with regard to the bacterial spectrum and resistance patterns against antibiotics. The dominating bacteria were Streptococci (25% of the isolates) and Staphylococci (24% of the isolates). In addition, members of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in approximately 10% of the cases. The most frequent anaerobes found were as follows: Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Prevotella and Fusobacterium. RESULTS: The resistance rates against antibiotics found were: penicillin G 36%, ampicillin 42%, and doxycycline 36%. In addition, the resistance rate against erythromycin and clindamycin was 26% and 7%, respectively. No resistant strains were detected against vancomycin and teicoplanin. All anaerobes showed a low antimicrobial resistance as previously described for odontogenic infections. CONCLUSION: In summary, soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region present a different spectrum of bacteria in contrast to the well-investigated odontogenic infections. Antibiotic administration should be, whenever possible, performed after differentiation of involved strains and resistogram. The most promising antibiotics are imipenem, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin as well as cefotiam. Modern fluoroquinolones will be the antibiotics of the future.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  - This aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various Nigerian chewing sticks. Aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of C. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in Nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. All the extracts demonstrated activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal isolates. Over half of the extracts were active against Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas gigivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. Extracts of the Vitellaria paradoxa root, Bridellia ferruginea stem and twigs, Garcinia cola stem, Terminalia glaucescens root, Morinda lucida root, and Cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. The extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - Infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (IC) caused by anaerobic bacteria. DESIGN: Presentation of a case series. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. Two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. There were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). The anaerobic isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), Prevotella spp. (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (2), and Propionibacterium acnes (1). The aerobic isolates were E. coli (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and group B streptococci (1). Blood cultures were positive for three patients. The most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). All patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the IC. Osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. All patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in IC in newborns.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with nasal polyposis.
AB  - Aspirates from 48 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses from patients who had nasal polyposis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was present in 46 (96%) specimens. Aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 6 (13%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria alone in 18 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 22 (48%). There were 110 bacterial isolates (2.4 per specimen). Thirty-nine of the isolates were aerobic or facultative organisms (0.85 per specimen). The predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were: Staphylococcus aureus, microaerophilic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Seventy-one anaerobes were isolated (1.5 per specimen), Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Fusobacterium spp. being predominant. These findings illustrate for the first time the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis who had nasal polyposis.
TI  - Microbiology of acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with an odontogenic origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: : To study the microbiology of sinusitis associated with odontogenic  origin. METHODS: : Aspirates of 20 acutely and 28 chronically infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: : A total of 66 isolates were recovered from the 20 cases of acute sinusitis (3.3/specimen), 16 aerobic and facultatives, and 50 anaerobic. Aerobes alone were recovered in 2 (10%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (50%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 8 (40%). The predominant aerobic were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5), microaerophilic streptococci (4), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (22), Peptostreptococcus (12), and Fusobacterium spp. (9). A total of 98 isolates were recovered from the 28 cases of chronic sinusitis (3.5/patient): 21 aerobic and facultatives and 77 anaerobic. Aerobes were recovered in 3 (11%) instances, anaerobes only in 11 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (50%). The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (7), microaerophilic streptococci (4), and S. aureus (5). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-negative bacilli (41), Peptostreptococcus (16), and Fusobacterium spp. (12). Thirteen beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were recovered from 10 (50%) patients with acute sinusitis and 25 BLPB from 21 (75%) patients with chronic sinusitis. No correlation was found between the predisposing odontogenic conditions and the microbiological findings. CONCLUSIONS: : These data illustrate the similar microbiology of acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with odontogenic infection where anaerobic bacteria predominate in both types of infections.
TI  - Microbiology and management of infected neck cysts.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review and describe the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of infected neck cysts. METHOD: Review the current medical literature and current textbooks. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are the predominant aerobic isolates, while pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp., all part of the oral flora, are the predominant anaerobes. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage and resection may be necessary in case of suppuration. Prevention of suppuration can be achieved by surgical removal of cysts before acquisition of infection, or removal of those recurrently infected. CONCLUSION: Recognition of the importance of the skin or the oral flora in infected neck cysts can assist in the proper selection of antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant skin/soft tissue pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens in obese patients. METHODS: We obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. Following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. These samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/mL) and one strain each of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC 1.0 microg/mL). Serum inhibitory titers (SITs) and bactericidal titers (SBTs) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. RESULTS: Mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/mL at these respective time points. Median SITs for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of MRSA (MIC 4.0 microg/mL); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. Furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median SBTs were observed against one isolate of MRSA (MIC 1.0 microg/mL) as well as the strain of VRE and P. magnus. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. One treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (MIC > or =4.0 microg/mL) strain of S. aureus. Bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.
TI  - Microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. Predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group A streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ), Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae . Anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while S. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. More than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. Management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. However, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. Untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. Death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.
TI  - Surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  - Surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. One hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. The number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). The aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. Most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. Common microorganisms isolated in our study were E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. The most effective antibiotics for S. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). For Gram-negatives (Klebsiella spp., E. coli and Proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). The greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in P. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (33.3%), Proteus spp. (33.3%), E. coli (22.2%), and S. aureus (12.5%). All the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). Apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical infections.
TI  - Intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. They often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. The original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. The treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology, and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on PCR method].
AB  - Infections in chronic otitis media (COM) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. This fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. Amplification of bacterial DNA in PCR is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. The authors present material of 53 patients with COM, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic and molecular PCR method were performed. The results of both methods were compared. In classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). The most often isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), Staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), Peptostreptococcus sp. and Fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and Proteus mirabilis (7.5%). In 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. Using molecular diagnostic of PCR, the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%). Isolated strains of P. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in PCR-finger-printing technique. The authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in COM are P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and the PCR technique for identification of bacterial DNA presence is very sensitive and allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with COM. Combination of classical bacteriological tests with PCR technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with COM.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Septic arthritis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A retrospective review of postoperative infected anterior cruciate  ligament (ACL) reconstruction was done on 472 consecutive cases in one institution. The purpose was to assess the incidence, diagnosis, treatment and outcome factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of 472 arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions performed between 1999 and 2002, 7 (1%) postoperative deep intra-articular infections were detected. Seven males with a mean age of 23 years (range, 19 to 30 years) formed the study group; 3 had undergone prior knee surgery. RESULTS: Four patients had acute infection (<2 weeks), 3 had subacute infection (2 weeks to 2 months) and none had late infection (>2 months). All were admitted within 24 hours of onset of symptoms and underwent immediate arthroscopic lavage, incision and drainage of abscess, debridement with graft retention and intravenous (8 to 31 days) followed by oral (4 to 6 weeks) antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus was present in 4 patients, Peptostreptococcus in 3, Klebsiella in 1, and Enterobacter in 1. The patients underwent an average of 1.4 arthroscopic procedures (range, 1 to 3 procedures), with an average hospital stay of 17.3 days per patient. All were evaluated at an average of 11.7 months (range, 5 to 26 months). In all cases, the infection resolved with stable knees and with all grafts and implants retained. Although rare, early diagnosis and prompt treatment of infection can result in successful eradication without sacrificing the graft.
TI  - Microbiology of infected hemangiomas in children.
AB  - Bacterial infections are a common complication of hemangiomas in children. The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemangiomas. A retrospective 8-year review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected hemangiomas was carried out. Specimens from infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was present in 32 of 38 specimens. Aerobic bacteria alone were recovered in 12 infected hemangiomas (37.5%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (33%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 12 (37.5%). A total of 80 isolates (47 aerobes and 33 anaerobes) were recovered, giving an average of 2.5 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 1.0 anaerobes). The highest number of isolates were recovered in infections of the perineum (3.7 per site) and the legs (2.8 per site). The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp., gram-negative bacilli, and Fusobacterium sp. Organisms that belong to the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in infections next to those membranes. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected hemangiomas and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions is thereby demonstrated.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Presurgical antimicrobial prophylaxis: effect on ocular flora in healthy patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of presurgical antimicrobial prophylaxis for reduction of ocular flora. SETTING: Ophthalmology Section, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Catania, Italy. METHODS: Three days before photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), conjunctiva of 70 healthy patients (100 eyes) were swabbed. After 3 days of instillation of ofloxacin 0.3% (3 times daily), conjunctival swabs were taken again. Bacteria were isolated and identified from each swab. RESULTS: A total of 191 independent isolates were obtained prior to antimicrobial treatment. Bacteria were isolated from all 100 eyes sampled. Gram-positive species predominated, with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus cultured from 69% and 25% of eyes sampled, respectively. Species of the anaerobic genera Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were found in 22% and 14% of eyes, respectively. After prophylaxis with ofloxacin, bacteria could be cultured from only 7% of eyes (10 independent isolates). All isolates were sensitive to ofloxacin except 5 strains of S. epidermidis, which displayed intermediate sensitivity. No infections occurred after PRK. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis by instillation of ofloxacin 0.3% 3 times daily for 3 days substantially reduced the ocular flora of 100 healthy eyes prior to refractive surgery.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  - We studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. We recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. Aerobes only were recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). Among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were Streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), Corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), Staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), Moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), Hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group C beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). Among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of Peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), Prevotella (22 [25.3%]), Actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), Propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), Fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and Veillonella (1 [1.1%]). Beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). We found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. Our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem (MK-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 Enterobacteriaceae, 15 Aeromonas spp., 42 Staphylococcus spp., 43 Streptococcus spp., 15 Enterococcus spp., 30 Haemophilus spp., 15 Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 Acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 Clostridium spp., 12 Peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group Bacteroides recovered from four Spanish hospitals. Ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. Ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded AmpC betalactamase-producing strains. Ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (MIC(90) > or =16 mg/l). Ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) < or =1 mg/l). In the case of Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a MIC(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. When considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against Clostridium spp. (MIC(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/l). Both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. Due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.
TI  - Six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. CASES: Five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. The hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. Thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary Medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. OBSERVATIONS: The culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the Medpor implant patient. Culture for the remaining patient was negative . CONCLUSIONS: If there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. Systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. If no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Microbiology and management of chronic suppurative otitis media in children.
AB  
TI  - Effect of amoxicillin or clindamycin on the adenoids bacterial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the effect on the adenoid bacterial flora of patients with recurrent otitis media of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin (Am) or clindamycin (C). Patients and methods Forty-five children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy participated in a prospective randomized study. They were divided into 3 groups of 15 each to receive either no therapy (control) or 10 days of therapy with Am or C. Core adenoid tissues was quantitatively cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora were present in all instances. The predominant aerobes in all groups were alpha-hemolytic and gamma-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The prominent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. The number of isolates was significantly reduced in those treated with Am (n = 110, P < 0.05) or C (n = 58, P < 0.001) compared with control (n = 148). The number of bacteria per gram/tissue was lower in those treated with either antibiotics. The number of potential pathogens was lower in those treated with C compared with the other 2 groups (P < 0.001). The number of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was lower in those treated with C than in those treated with Am (P < 0.025) or control (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate the ability of C and, to a lesser degree, of Am to reduce the bacterial load as well as potential pathogens and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from the adenoids of children with recurrent otitis media.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Immunoglobulin-binding domains: Protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  - Protein L is a multidomain cell-wall protein isolated from Peptostreptococcus magnus. It belongs to a group of proteins that contain repeated domains that are able to bind to Igs without stimulating an immune response, the most characterized of this group being Protein A ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and Protein G ( Streptococcus ). Both of these proteins bind predominantly to the interface of C(H)2-C(H)3 heavy chains, while Protein L binds exclusively to the V(L) domain of the kappa -chain. The function of these proteins in vivo is not clear but it is thought that they enable the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. Two binding sites for kappa -chain on a single Ig-binding domain from Protein L have recently been reported and we give evidence that one site has a 25-55-fold higher affinity for kappa -chain than the second site.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens from patients with acute pelvic infection.
AB  - This study compared the in vitro activities of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam against 314 aerobic bacteria and of ertapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ticarcillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole against 500 anaerobic bacteria from 212 patients with acute pelvic infection. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution (aerobes) or agar dilution (anaerobes), following NCCLS guidelines. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae and Peptostreptococcus spp. Ertapenem was the most active drug tested against Enterobacteriaceae (100% susceptible) and anaerobes (99.8% susceptible); the least active agents were co-amoxiclav (79% of Enterobacteriaceae susceptible) and ceftriaxone (85.9% of anaerobes susceptible). All agents tested had excellent activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - The current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type-b, and Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Kingela kingae, Neisseria meningiditis and Salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. Gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. The predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are S. aureus, H. influenzae type-b, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, K. kingae, Bartonella henselae and Borrelia burgdorferi. Anaerobes have rarely been reported as a cause of these infections in children. The main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic Gram negative bacilli including Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. Most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg BID with either cefuroxime 250 mg BID or cefadroxil 500 mg BID for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. Because these infections typically are confined to the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. OBJECTIVE: This paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. METHODS: Two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each BID for 10 days. Study 1 compared cefditoren with cefuroxime; Study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. Clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). Patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. Within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. Cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. Clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. At the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in Study 1 (P = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in Study 2 (P = 0.018). Eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for Peptostreptococcus species in Study 2 (P = 0.016 and P = 0.003, respectively). A minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each P < 0.05). All 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.
TI  - Cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology and management of the major cutaneous and  subcutaneous infections in newborns where anaerobic bacteria predominate: omphalitis, necrotizing fasciitis, breast abscess, and scalp infection following intrauterine fetal monitoring. The predominant bacteria known to cause these infections are group B streptococcus, group D enterococcus, group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. All of these agents can colonize or infect the mother and subsequently colonize or infect the fetus or newborn either intrauterinely or during the passage through the birth canal. Infections due to anaerobes are often polymicrobial, and include also aerobic and facultative bacteria. The anaerobes recovered from these infections are Bacteroided fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Early recognition and effective medical and surgical therapy are essential to recovery. Managements of these infections include surgical debridement and drainage when appropriate as well as topical and systemic use of antimicrobial agents effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of suppurative sialadenitis.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from acute suppurative sialadenitis were investigated for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 47 specimens, 32 from parotid, 9 from submandibular and 6 from sublingual glands yielded bacterial growth. Fifty five isolates, 25 aerobic and 30 anaerobic, were isolated from parotid infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 13 (41%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 11 (34%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 8 (25%). Of a total of 17 isolates, 8 aerobic and 9 anaerobic, from submandibular gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 3 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 4 (44%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 2 (22%). Ten isolates, 5 aerobic and 5 anaerobic, were from sublingual gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 2 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 2 (33%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 2 (33%). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae while the predominant anaerobes were gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp.) and Peptostreptococcus spp. The study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute suppurative sialadenitis.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  - Antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (A, B) of 40 teeth and 3 groups of 15 teeth (C, D, E). A defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 43719), Eikenella corrodens (ATCC 51724), or Peptostreptococcus micros (ATCC 33270). Subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group A, B) or 55 and 75 (group C, D, E) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. The source of laser radiation was an Er:YAG laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. The number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by the Scheffe-test. RESULTS: Depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the E. coli group was reduced by the Er:YAG laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the Staph. aureus group to 15.1%. The number of bacteria in case of A. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in case of E. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of P. micros to 22.0% after application of 75 laser pulses. CONCLUSION: Besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on root surfaces.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - The microbiology of mucopyocele.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of mucopyocele. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical and microbiologic records of patients with mucopyocele between June 1982 and September 1997. METHODS: Aspirates of 36 mucopyocele were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: One hundred six bacterial isolates, 42 aerobic and facultatives and 64 anaerobic, were recovered. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus spp. (5), and Gram-negative bacilli (6). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (22), Prevotella sp. (15), Fusobacterium sp. (5), and Propionibacterium acnes(5). Thirty-three beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 23 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of mucopyocele.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - Effect of amoxycillin with or without clavulanate on adenoid bacterial flora.
AB  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxycillin (AMX) or co-amoxiclav (AMC)  on the adenoid bacterial flora of 45 children with recurrent otitis media (ROM), scheduled for elective adenoidectomy, was studied. Patients were randomized before surgery into three groups of 15, having had either no antibiotic therapy (control), or 10 days of therapy with AMX or AMC. Core adenoid tissues were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora was present in all instances. The predominant aerobes in all groups were alpha-haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-haemolytic streptococci and Moraxella catarrhalis. The prominent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. The number of isolates was significantly reduced in those treated with AMX (110; P < 0.05) or AMC (54; P < 0.001) compared with control (148). The number of bacteria per gram of tissue was lower in those treated with both antibiotics. The number of potential pathogens was lower in those treated with AMC compared with the other two groups (P < 0.001 ). The number of beta-lactamase- producing bacteria (BLPB) was lower in those treated with AMC compared with those treated with AMX (P < 0.025) or no antibiotic (P < 0.001). These data illustrate the ability of AMX and AMC to reduce the bacterial load as well as potential pathogens and BLPB from the adenoids of children with ROM.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - [Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (Zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  - Azithromycin (Zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in Japan in March 2000. It showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Peptostreptococcus micros, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Its activity against H. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. After oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. Its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of S. aureus. In experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. These pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.
TI  - In vitro activity and post-antibiotic effect of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid).
AB  - The in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid), ampicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were examined and compared against 526 gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were low (MIC(90) = 0.5 mg/l), and were comparable with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. This compound was superior to the macrolides and highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains), with MIC(90) = 2 mg/l. It was also active against other streptococci, with MIC(90) = 4 mg/l. However, this agent is less active against enterococci (MIC(90) = 32 mg/l). Quinupristin/dalfopristin showed high activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., with MIC(90) < or = 2 mg/l. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was also investigated for its post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and bactericidal kinetics against nine strains of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. Exponentially growing (log phase) cultures were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin at 2 x MIC. Growth kinetics was evaluated using viable counting. The drug was uniformly bactericidal against pneumococci and staphylococci within 2 and 8 h of exposure, respectively. The killing activity against enterococci was weak; there was little or no reduction in bacterial count over 24 h of incubation. PAEs ranging from 2.13 to 3.28 h, 0.92 to 3.02 h and 1.89 to 7.07 h were produced on the tested pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. This study showed that quinupristin/dalfopristin is a promising agent active against gram-positive bacteria. The prolonged PAEs also suggest that the drug could be used intermittently at more widely spaced dosing intervals against gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. Several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein M and capsulae. Streptolysin O and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. Toxins A and C act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. Capsule, protein A, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. In infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group A streptococci are Peptostreptococcus magnus, oral Prevotella, Porphyromonas spp., and Fusobacterium spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located next to the perineal area. Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal infections. However benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. Since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci and anaerobes. In some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. The efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ failure.
TI  - Correlation between microbiology and previous sinus surgery in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Moraxella catarrhalis (10), and Haemophilus spp (8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp (61), Prevotella spp (45), Fusobacterium spp (15), and Propionibacterium acnes (14). Analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous sinus surgery. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (GNAB) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had P aeruginosa and 17 had GNAB) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had P aeruginosa and 7 had GNAB; p < .001). Anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). These findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus renal abscess: a rare cause of fever of unknown origin.
AB  - Renal abscess is uncommon in pediatrics and is rarely a cause of fever of unknown origin. We recently cared for a patient who presented with a 3-week history of fever. An indium scan ultimately led to the diagnosis of a renal abscess. Aspiration yielded Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. This unusual case prompted a review of the clinical and microbiologic features of renal abscess in pediatric patients at our hospital over the past 10 years. Seven additional patients with a discharge diagnosis of renal abscess were identified. Only 2 of the patients had identifiable risk factors (diabetes mellitus and polycystic kidneys). Staphylococcus aureus or Enterobacteriaceae were responsible for most infections, consistent with hematogenous and urinary tract sources, respectively. No other cases of anaerobic abscess were identified. This case highlights the importance of considering a renal abscess in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and of processing specimens for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Bacterial immunoglobulin superantigen proteins A and L activate human heart mast  cells by interacting with immunoglobulin E.
AB  - Human heart mast cells (HHMC) have been identified in heart tissue, perivascularly, and in the intima of coronary arteries. In vitro activation of isolated HHMC induces the release of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators (histamine, tryptase, and cysteinyl leukotriene C(4) [LTC(4)]). We investigated the effects of several bacterial proteins on HHMC activation in vitro. HHMC released histamine, tryptase, and LTC(4) in response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 and the immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein A, but not to S. aureus Wood 46, which does not synthesize protein A. The effect of protein A was inhibited by preincubation with monoclonal IgM V(H)3(+). Some strains of Peptostreptococcus magnus express an Ig light chain-binding surface protein called protein L. Such bacteria and soluble protein L stimulated the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators from HHMC. Preincubation of HHMC with either protein A or protein L resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus or anti-IgE. Monoclonal IgE (kappa chains) blocked protein L-induced release, whereas IgE (lambda chains) had no effect. Streptococcal protein G, formyl-containing tripeptide, and pepstatin A did not activate HHMC. Bacterial products protein A and protein L and intact bacteria (S. aureus and P. magnus) activate HHMC by acting as Ig superantigens.
TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) CFU/spot for aerobes and 10(5) CFU for anaerobes. The following are the MIC ranges and MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of ABT-773 for various isolates, respectively: Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other Pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; Eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. For anaerobes the MIC ranges and MIC(90)s of ABT-773 were as follows, respectively: Prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; Prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; Porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml; Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other Fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; Bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. ABT-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against S. aureus, E. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against F. nucleatum. The activity of ABT-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against Pasteurella spp., and ABT-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against Pasteurella spp. ABT-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased adenoids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the qualitative and quantitative microbiology of core adenoid tissue obtained from four groups of 15 children each, with recurrent otitis media (ROM), recurrent adenotonsillitis (RAT), obstructive adenoid hypertrophy (OAH), and occlusion or speech abnormalities (controls). METHODS: Core cultures of surgically removed diseased adenoids and of healthy controls were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora were present in all instances. Ninety-four organisms were isolated from control specimens, and 148 from ROM, 142 from RAT, and 149 from OAH specimens. The predominant aerobes in all groups were alpha-hemolytic and gamma-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The prominent anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium species. The number, concentration and distribution of types of most organisms did not vary among the three groups of diseased adenoids. However, the number of those that are potential pathogens and those that produced beta-lactamase was lower in the control than the diseased adenoids (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of the bacterial load in the adenoids in contributing to the etiology of ROM, RAT, and OAH.
TI  - Microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  - We report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. The study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy lesions. Bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). Forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four) and Fusobacterium spp. (two). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. The polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Microbiology of subphrenic abscesses: a 14-year experience.
AB  - The objective of the review was to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of subphrenic abscesses in relation with predisposing conditions. A retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 52 patients treated between 1974 and 1988 was conducted. Forty-three (83%) patients developed the abscesses after an operative procedure. These included 11 patients after colonic, 9 patients after gastric or duodenal, 7 patients after abdominal trauma, 7 patients after biliary, and 6 patients after appendix surgery. A total of 194 organisms (3.7 isolates/specimen), 83 aerobic (1.6/specimen), and 111 anaerobes (2.1/specimen) were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 7 (13%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 34 (65%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 47 (90%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli (28 isolates), Enterococcus group D(9), and Staphylococcus aureus (9). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (33 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (25), Clostridium species (13), and Prevotella species (6). The number of isolates/site varied. The number of anaerobic bacteria/site outnumbered or was equal to the number of aerobic or facultatives in all instances, except in abscesses after biliary surgery. Their number/site was especially high in abscesses after appendectomy, and the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was the lowest after gastric or duodenal surgery. S. aureus predominated after gastric, duodenal and posttrauma surgery; B. fragilis predominated after colonic, appendix, and postabdominal trauma surgery; Enterococcus group D predominated after biliary surgery; Fusobacterium and Prevotella species predominated after gastric or duodenal surgery; and Clostridium species predominated after colonic or appendix surgery. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of subphrenic abscesses and their correlation with predisposing surgery.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility to pexiganan of bacteria isolated from infected diabetic  foot ulcers.
AB  - During two clinical trials involving the treatment of 835 outpatients with infected diabetic foot ulcers, 2515 bacterial isolates, including 2337 aerobes and 178 anaerobes, were grown from cultures of the ulcers. The in vitro susceptibility of these isolates was determined to pexiganan, a peptide anti-infective evaluated in these clinical trials, and to other classes of antibiotics. Pexiganan demonstrated broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. The MIC90 values for the most common species among 1735 Gram-positive aerobes isolated, such as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Group A streptococci, and Group B streptococci, were 16 micrograms/mL or less. Of 602 Gram-negative aerobes tested, the MIC90 values for pexiganan were 16 micrograms/mL or less for Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Flavobacterium species. Pexiganan had a MIC90 of 4 to 16 micrograms/mL against the anaerobic isolates of Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, and Prevotella species. Importantly, pexiganan did not exhibit cross-resistance with other commonly used antibiotics, including beta-lactams, quinolones, macrolides, and lincosamides. The broad spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity of pexiganan against clinical isolates from infected diabetic foot ulcers supports its potential as a local therapy for infected diabetic foot ulcers.
TI  - Microbiological understandings and mysteries of noma (cancrum oris).
AB  - The microbiologic history of noma was reviewed. Studies have associated the disease process with large numbers of fusiform bacilli and spirochetal organisms. In order to study the microbiology of the staging and infection periods of noma 62 Nigerian children, aged 3-14 years, 22 children had acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) and were also malnourished, 20 exhibited no acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis but were malnourished and 20 were free of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and in good nutritional state) were evaluated for the presence of viruses and oral microorganisms. The ANUG cases in the malnourished children had a higher incidence of Herpesviridae, the main virus being detected was cytomegalovirus. There were more anaerobic microorganisms recovered, with Prevotella intermedia as the predominant isolate, in the malnourished children as compared to the healthy children. A study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma lesions was carried out in eight noma patients, 3-15 years of age, in Sokoto State, northwestern Nigeria. Fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from 87.5% of the noma lesions. Oral microorganisms isolated included Prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and Actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0, 50.0 and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. All strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of P. intermedia which showed resistance to penicillin. The pathogenic mechanisms of F. necrophorum as a trigger organism were discussed. The isolation from human noma lesions of F. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - The microbiology of infected and noninfected leg ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A clinical study was undertaken to investigate and compare specifically the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected and noninfected leg ulcers. METHODS: Leg ulcers, defined as being infected on the basis of clinical signs, were swab sampled and investigated for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms using stringent isolation and identification techniques. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty isolates were cultured from 44 infected leg ulcers, in comparison with 110 isolates from 30 noninfected leg ulcers. Statistical analysis indicated a significantly greater mean number of anaerobic bacteria per infected ulcer (particularly Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp.) in comparison with the noninfected ulcer group (2.5 vs. 1.3, respectively) (P < 0.05). Also, anaerobes represented 49% of the total microbial composition in infected leg ulcers compared with 36% in noninfected leg ulcers. The mean numbers of aerobes per wound in the two ulcer groups were not statistically different (P > 0.05). The study failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between commonly implicated facultative pathogens and wound infection. The isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low and, although Staphylococcus aureus was a frequent isolate in both wound types, it was more prevalent in noninfected leg ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the complex aerobic-anaerobic microflora which exists in leg ulcers, the prevalence of anaerobes in infected wounds, and a poor correlation between the presence of specific aerobic pathogens and wound infection. In view of these findings, the role of microbial synergistic interactions in the pathogenesis of chronic wound infection may be of greater clinical importance than the isolated involvement of any specific potential pathogen.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience at a single institution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and microbiologic characteristics, modalities of  treatment and outcome of patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis admitted to our institution. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 20 consecutive patients hospitalized in our Intensive Care Unit between January 1987 and June 1998 with the diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis. RESULTS: All the patients required mechanical ventilation. Four of them had mediastinal involvement. The organisms most commonly implicated included Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species. Patients with adequate surgery had a better outcome than those with inadequate surgical procedures. Because no evidence-based recommendations exist in the field of head and neck infections, hyperbaric oxygen was not used as adjunctive therapy. Of the 20 patients, 3 (15 %) died. CONCLUSION: The main finding of this study is that prompt, rather than delayed, surgical debridement correlates with a decrease in morbidity and mortality. However, no definite conclusion is justified due to the relatively small number of patients. Immediate radical debridement, and early redebridement if needed, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care support are critical in controlling these life-threatening infections.
TI  - Microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses in children.
AB  - Samples of pus from 41 children with retroperitoneal abscess treated between 1974 and 1994 yielded a total of 125 organisms (3.0 isolates/specimen); 58 isolates were aerobic and facultative species (1.4/specimen) and 67 were anaerobic (1.6/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 7 (17%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from 3 (7%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 31 (76%); 34 (83%) infections were polymicrobial. The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (19 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (6), and the predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (22) and Prevotella spp. (5).
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common bacteria found in cultures from the deep portions of hidradenitis suppurativa lesions, as obtained by carbon dioxide laser surgery.
AB  - The significance of bacterial findings in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is controversial. Interpretation of the results of bacteriological examinations from the surface of HS lesions is obscured by the possible contamination of resident skin bacteria. Bacteriological analysis of aspirates from deeper parts of HS is liable to show low sensitivity. We used a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser method to evaporate the diseased tissue level by level from the surface downwards, allowing concurrent sampling of bacteriological cultures from each level and thereby minimizing contamination with bacteria from the level above. In this study, 22 women and three men with a mean age of 35.3 years and a mean HS duration of 10.6 years were treated with this CO2 laser surgical method. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from superficial and deep levels were taken during surgery. The regions treated were axillary in eight and perineal in 17 cases. Bacterial cultures were positive for one or more specimens from at least one level in all cases and from deep levels in all but three cases. Sixteen different species or sub-species were found. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the species most frequently found. Peptostreptococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes were not uncommon. S. aureus was detected in a total of 14 cases, six of which were from the deep levels. S. aureus was the sole bacterium isolated in two deep cultures. CNS were found in 21 patients and 16 of these isolates were from the deep levels. In nine of the 16 deep samples CNS were the only bacteria detected. These findings motivate a re-evaluation of the significance of bacteria in the progress of HS and in particular they suggest that CNS are true pathogens. It is known that foreign bodies aggravate the virulence of the CNS in surgical implants, and an environment which resembles that produced by a foreign body, as found in chronic HS tissue, serves to intensify the pathogenic properties of CNS in HS.
TI  - The microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  - This study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (NR-group; 11 participants) or responsive (R-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. Microbiological samples from three types of pocket (< 4 mm deep A-samples; 4-5 mm B-samples; > 5 mm C-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. Actinomyces naeslundii, A. israelii, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. The periodontitis pathogens Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the A- and B-samples of both patient groups and in the C-samples of the R-group. In the C-samples of the NR-group their mean counts were 45%. Correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the C-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. The results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. Further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Infection after rotator cuff repair.
AB  - Sixteen patients (15 men and 1 woman) were treated for infection complicating rotator cuff repair during the period 1975 through 1994. Eight of the 16 patients had their initial procedure performed elsewhere. The remaining 8 procedures were performed at our institution with the known incidence of this complication being 0.27%. In addition to intravenous antibiotic therapy, an average of 3.5 (range 2 to 8) operative procedures were required to eradicate the infections. Micro-organisms cultured were Propionibacter in 6, coagulase negative Staphylococcus in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 4, Peptostreptococcus magnus in 1, and both Propionibacter and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 1. The deltoid was restored in all patients; the rotator cuff was reparable in 11. In the 12 shoulders with greater than 1 year of follow-up (average 51 months, range 14 to 165 months), active elevation averaged 110 degrees and external rotation 50 degrees. Four patients had no pain, 4 had minimal pain, and the remaining 4 had moderate pain. Satisfactory final results, which were determined by the patients' opinion or with the use of either the University of California, Los Angeles score or the modified Neer system, were obtained in 5 (42%) of the shoulders.
TI  - Isolation of Fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  - A study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in Sokoto State in northwestern Nigeria. Paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. Fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from 87.5% of the noma lesions. Oral microorganisms included Prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. The F. necrophorum and P. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the E-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of P. intermedia, which showed resistance to penicillin. The first reported isolation from human noma lesions of F. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of axillary hidradenitis suppurativa.
AB  - A retrospective review of the microbiological and clinical data of 17 specimens obtained from axillary hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) over a period of 6 years was undertaken to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of this condition. A total of 42 bacterial isolates (2.5 per specimen) were obtained, 12 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 30 anaerobic or micro-aerophilic (1.8 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were isolated in six (35%) cases, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in four (24%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (six isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (three) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two). The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (10), Prevotella spp. (seven), micro-aerophilic streptococci (four), Fusobacterium spp. (three) and Bacteroides spp. sensu stricto (three). This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in axillary HS and the need for antimicrobial thereby to reflect this.
TI  - Microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children: comparison of skin swabs and needle aspiration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children, comparing skin swab and needle aspirate methodology. METHOD: Swabs of involved skin and needle aspirates of cellulitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 10 patients with perianal cellulitis showed bacterial growth. Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora was found in all skin surface cultures, where the predominate isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and alpha hemolytic streptococci. The number of isolates in needle aspirates varied between one and two. The predominant ones were E. coli (3), Peptostreptococcus spp. (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Bacteroides fragilis group (2). Complete or partial concordance in microbiology between skin swabs and needle aspirates was present in six instances. In four instances, isolates recovered from needle aspirates were not isolated from the skin surface. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the diversity of aerobic and anaerobic organisms isolated from perianal cellulitis, and the superiority of needle aspirates in establishing the microbiology of the infection.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of persistent otitis media.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the pathogens isolated from children with acute otitis media who did not respond to antimicrobial drug therapy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cultures obtained by tympanocentesis from 46 children. RESULTS: Organisms were recovered from 34 children (74%), and 43 isolates were recovered from these individuals. The organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae non-type b (12 isolates), Moraxella catarrhalis (5 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (5 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (2 isolates). Resistance to the antimicrobial agent used was found in 27 (63%) of 43 isolates found in 22 patients (48%). Of patients who did not respond to amoxicillin therapy, H influenzae predominated. Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 5 (56%) of 9 of those who did not respond to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy, 4 (44%) of 9 patients after azithromycin therapy, 3 (25%) of 12 patients after amoxicillin therapy, and 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole therapy and from 2 (40%) of 5 patients after cefixime therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the relation between resistance to antimicrobial drug therapy and failure of patients with otitis media to improve. They also highlight the importance of diagnostic tympanocentesis in establishing the presence of resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in pharyngitis and tonsillitis].
AB  - The aim of the study was a microbiological analysis of pharyngeal swabs obtained  from 158 patients with the diagnosis of pharyngitis and purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. Beta haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G were isolated from 30% of the patients. The most frequently isolated were Streptococcus pyogenes--12% of patients and Streptococcus group C--10.7%. Other streptococci were isolated less frequently: Streptococcus group B--44%, group G--2.5%. The majority of isolated bacteria belonged to potential pathogenic flora (70% patients). Staphylococcus aureus (37%) and Haemophilus spp. (36%) were isolated most frequently. Other bacteria were isolated in the following sequence: Moraxella catarrhalis--22%, Streptococcus pneumoniae--17% and Gram-negative rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family--6%. One case of Plaut-Vincent tonsillitis was diagnosed. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from purulent exudates from the tonsillar crypts of 10 patients treated for chronic purulent tonsillitis. The isolated anaerobic bacteria belonged to genus of Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Gemella.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Microbiology of cervical lymphadenitis in adults.
AB  - The microbiology of needle aspirates from 40 inflamed cervical lymph glands was studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Forty-two bacterial, 11 mycobacterial and six fungal isolates were isolated. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 11 (27.5%), anaerobes alone in five (12.5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven (17.5%). Mycobacterium sp. were recovered in 11 (27.5%) and fungi in six (15%). The recovery of anaerobes was associated with dental infection. Eighteen aerobic bacteria were isolated and the predominant ones were Staphylococcus aureus (eight isolates) and group A streptococci (four). Twenty-four anaerobic bacteria were recovered and the predominant ones were: Prevotella sp. (six), Peptostreptococcus sp. (five), Propionibacterium acnes (four) and Fusobacterium sp. (three). These findings demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material from the glands for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  - The microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. Aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (TT). The middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. Analysis of the 138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28 patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in 20 (36%). There were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. Commonly recovered aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Proteus sp. (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (5). Commonly isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), Prevotella sp. (10), Bacteroides sp. (8) and Fusobacterium sp. (6). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of TT-related otorrhea in children. Specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the TT or through the open perforation after their removal.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of dacryocystitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of dacryocystitis. METHOD: Retrospective review of the 62 clinical and microbiologic records collected between 1980 and 1990. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 32 cases (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in 20 cases (32%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven cases (11%), and fungi in three cases (5%). A total of 94 organisms (1.5 per specimen), which included 56 aerobic or facultative anaerobic organisms, 35 anaerobic organisms, and three fungi, were recovered. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Staphylococcus epidermidis (13 isolates), and Pseudomonas species (seven isolates). The most frequently recovered anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (13 isolates), Propionibacterium species (12 isolates), Prevotella species (four isolates), and Fusobacterium species (three isolates). The predominant fungus was Candida albicans (two isolates). Polymicrobial infection was present in 28 cases (45%). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in dacryocystitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  - The goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. A total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. The malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and Candida spp. in 10 (1%). A total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), Peptostreptococcus spp. (166), Prevotella spp. (106), Clostridium spp. (70), and Fusobacterium spp. (43). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (133), Staphylococcus aureus (100), Klebsiella pneumoniae (48), and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). The type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). S. aureus and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). This retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-seven patients were studied prospectively for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections. All cases yielded organisms on culture. A total of 377 isolates were recovered (239 aerobes, 116 anaerobes and 22 fungi). Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 49 patients (38.6%). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in four patients (3.2%). Candida sp. alone was present in one patient (0.8%). Mixed aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria and/or fungi were present in 73 patients (57.5%). Fungi were isolated from 21 patients (23.9%) of 88 patients having fungal cultures. The predominant isolates recovered in descending order of frequency were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides sp., Klebsiella sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. There were 70 patients (55.1%) infected with anaerobic bacteria. The rate of recovery of anaerobes was higher in patients with open wound dressing (72.7%) than in patients with occlusive wound dressings (41.7%), (P < 0.01). Seventeen patients presented with septic shock, 15 of them (88.2%) yielding positive anaerobic cultures. Bacteroides sp. were isolated from 14 patients with septic shock, and were recovered from the four patients who had anaerobic infection alone. These results indicate a significant role of Bacteroides sp. in burn wound sepsis.
TI  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus Peptostreptococcus. GPAC are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. They have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. Nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. Several species of Peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. Identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most GPAC are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. Recent reports have documented the isolation in pure culture of several species, notably Peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious infections. Studies of P. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to Staphylococcus aureus. P. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species. Penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of P. anaerobius show broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - Bacteriology of inflamed and uninflamed epidermal inclusion cysts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inflamed and uninflamed epidermoid cysts differ in the number and/or type of bacteria inhabiting them. DESIGN: A controlled study. We obtained aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture specimens from 25 inflamed and 25 uninflamed epidermoid cysts. SETTING: A university medical center. PATIENTS: Nonimmunocompromised adults without recent systemic use of antibiotics. RESULTS: The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to number of bacterial isolates, "no growth" cultures, and aerobic, anaerobic, or potential pathogens cultured. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological milieu of inflamed epidermoid cysts is similar to that of uninflamed cysts. Possible mechanisms for inflammation are discussed.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children. METHOD: Retrospective review of sinus aspirate specimens obtained from 20 children with nosocomial sinusitis. The specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 58 isolates (2.9 per specimen), 30 aerobic or facultative (1.5 per specimen) and 28 anaerobic (1.4 per specimen), were recovered. Aerobes only were present in 8 patients (40%), anaerobes only in 5 (25%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 7 (35%). The predominant aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates), Escherichia coli (3 isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (8 isolates), Prevotella species (6 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (4 isolates). Forty-one beta-lactamase bacteria were recovered from 14 specimens (70%). Thirty isolates similar to the sinus isolates were also recovered from the trachea, 6 from blood culture specimens, and 6 from other sites. Anaerobes were more commonly isolated from sinus aspirate samples obtained after 18 days of mechanical ventilation (21 vs 7, P<.05 by chi2). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Prospective study of bacteremia rate after elastic band ligation and sclerotherapy of esophageal varices in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageal band ligation is considered to be as efficient as endoscopic sclerotherapy, with a lower complication rate, including bacteremia. There are few studies comparing the two methods. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of bacteremia after both treatments in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis. METHODS: Endoscopic sclerotherapy and band ligation were performed using standard techniques. Blood samples were obtained 5 and 30 minutes after endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. RESULTS: In the sclerotherapy group 2 of 43 (4.6%) blood cultures were positive (Peptostreptococcus sp and Streptococcus mitis). A similar result was obtained in the band ligation group: 2 of 35 (5.7%) had positive cultures, both with Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the frequency of bacteremia after treatment of esophageal varices with endoscopic sclerotherapy or endoscopic band ligation in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis.
TI  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscesses.
AB  - The microbiology of perirectal abscesses in 144 patients was studied. Aerobic or  facultative bacteria only were isolated in 13 (9%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 27 (19%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were isolated in 104 (72%) instances. A total of 325 anaerobic and 131 aerobic or facultative isolates were recovered (2.2 anaerobic isolates and 0.9 aerobic isolates per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis group (85 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp. (72 isolates), Prevotella spp. (71 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (21 isolates), Porphyromonas spp. (20 isolates), and Clostridium spp. (15 isolates). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (34 isolates), Streptococcus spp. (28 isolates), and Escherichia coli (19 isolates). These data illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perirectal abscesses.
TI  - In-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - One hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. All isolates, except Rothia spp. (one), Enterococcus avium (three), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. All the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. A potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the MICs of spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of Eubacterium, two of lactobacilli, one strain of Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.
TI  - Use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  - Synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube (Isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. Overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group G streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient each. Overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) Isolator cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (P < 0.02). Twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive Isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. Among the 24 cultures positive by both methods, higher numbers of CFU per milliliter were detected with the Isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (P < 0.002). Inoculation of synovial fluid into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.
TI  - Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  - The number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-GABHS tonsillitis. Antibody titres to four Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. An average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in GABHS tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-GABHS tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. There were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both GABHS and non-GABHS groups. These bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Peptostreptococcus spp., F. nucleatum, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp. Significantly higher antibodies levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients with non-GABHS pharyngo-tonsillitis (P < 0.001) and GABHS tonsillitis (P < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. The increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-GABHS and GABHS tonsillitis.
TI  - Gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  - The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. As the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. Problematic pathogens include strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. Other important pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups B, C, and G, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of Listeria and Corynebacterium and Gram-positive anaerobes, such as Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. Thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. The novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.
TI  - Microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  - Our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (NI) in children. We used a retrospective review of clinical microbiology laboratory and patients' records. Specimens were obtained from 40 patients with NI lesions and showed bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). Sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) (13 isolates), and Escherichia coli (1 isolate). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were S. aureus. S. aureus alone or mixed with GABHS or Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. Mixed flora of Peptostreptococcus spp. with Prevotella spp. or Fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while E. coli mixed with B. fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. Thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of NI lesions.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - Septic arthritis after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Diagnosis and management.
AB  - We performed a retrospective study of knee joint infections after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at our institution. Two thousand five hundred anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed between 1988 and 1993. Seven (0.3%) patients experienced postoperative deep infections of the knee. All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed using arthroscopically assisted techniques. Six (86%) of these patients had concomitant open procedures performed, including meniscal repair, posterolateral corner reconstruction, and medial collateral ligament reconstruction. Four patients had acute (< 2 weeks), two patients had subacute (2 weeks to 2 months), and one patient had late (> 2 months) infections. All patients had positive cultures from knee joint aspirates with the organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus, or a combination thereof. All patients underwent immediate arthroscopic irrigation and debridement. All infections were intraarticular; six patients also had extraarticular sites of infection. Four patients underwent repeat irrigation and debridement at approximately 1 week. The anterior cruciate ligament graft was removed from four patients. All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics for 4 to 6 weeks, protected weightbearing, and physical therapy. At a mean followup of 29 months, mean knee extension was 0 degree, and mean knee flexion was 122 degrees (range, 70 degrees to 135 degrees). Six (86%) patients had minimal to no pain in their operative knee, and they were satisfied with their functional results.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children. METHOD: Retrospective review of specimens obtained from 14 children with bacterial tracheitis that were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total 30 bacterial isolates were recovered, 17 aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 13 anaerobic. Aerobic bacteria only were present in six (43%) specimens, anaerobes only in three (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in five (36%). Polymicrobial flora was recovered in 10 of the 14 specimens. The predominant organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae type b (4), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas (4), Fusobacterium sp. (2), and Moraxella catarrhalis (2). Two organisms that were also isolated from the tracheal aspirates were recovered from the blood of two patients (one each of H. influenzae and Prevotella intermedia). Eleven beta-lactamase-producing organisms were isolated from nine patients. These included all isolates of S. aureus and M. catarrhalis, and two each of H. influenzae and Prevotella sp. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the predominance of S. aureus and H. influenzae in causing bacterial tracheitis in children and suggest a potential role for anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in chronic purulent maxillary sinusitis].
AB  - In the years from 1993 till 1995 there were 132 tests done on occurrence aerobes  (oxygen bacteria) and 56 tests on occurrence of anaerobes and fungus in patients with chronic sinusitis. The most common microorganisms among the aerobes was Haemophilus influenzae (23.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (20.9%). The most common microorganisms among the anaerobes was Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus (together 57.1%) and from the strains Bacteroides (36.8). The breeded oxygen microorganisms Gr(+) were mostly sensible to clindamycin, cefuroxim and augmentin; Gr(-) organisms to amicacin, gentamycin and cefuroxim. Anaerobes were mostly sensible to metronidazole and clindamycin.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis externa.
AB  - Microbiologic and clinical data from 26 patients with otitis externa were prospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. A total of 33 aerobic and 2 anaerobic bacteria were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 21 (91%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in 1 (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 1 (4%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 instances), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Proteus mirabilis (2), Enterococcus faecalis (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (1). One isolate was recovered in 13 (57%) patients, 2 isolates in 8 (35%), and 3 isolates in 2 (9%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of otitis externa in about half of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in 8% of them. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic implications of these findings.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Microbiology of acute purulent pericarditis. A 12-year experience in a military hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic micro-biological and clinical characteristics in 15 cases of acute pericarditis treated over a 12-year period. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data. SETTING: Military hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 7 specimens (47%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 6 specimens (40%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 2 specimens (13%). In total, there were 21 isolates: 10 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 11 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 1.4 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in patients with pericarditis who also had mediastinitis that followed esophageal perforation and in patients whose pericarditis was associated with orofacial and dental infections. The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 isolates), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella species (4 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (3 isolates), and Propionibacterium acnes (2 isolates). CONCLUSION: The findings in our study highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute pericarditis.
TI  - Deep neck infections.
AB  
TI  - Microbiology of subperiosteal orbital abscess and associated maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirate of pus from eight subperiosteal orbital abscesses (SPOAs) and their corresponding infected sinuses were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Polymicrobial flora was found in all instances, and the number of isolates varied from two to five. Anaerobes were recovered from all specimens. The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp, Prevotella spp, Fusobacterium spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and microaerophilic streptococci. Concordance in the microbiological findings between SPOA and the infected sinus was found in all instances. However, certain organisms were only present at one site and not the other. Fourteen beta-lactamase-producing organisms were present in nine specimens. These data confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis and demonstrate their predominance in the associated SPOA.
TI  - Isolation of non-sporing anaerobic rods from infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1994, 2033 microbiological specimens from children were submitted for cultures for anaerobic bacteria. Fifty-seven isolates of Bifidobacterium spp. were obtained from 55 (3%) children, 67 isolates of Eubacterium spp. from 65 (3%) children and 41 isolates of Lactobacillus spp. from 40 (2%) children. Most Bifidobacterium isolates were from chronic otitis media, abscesses, peritonitis, aspiration pneumonia and paronychia. Most Eubacterium isolates were from abscesses, peritonitis, decubitus ulcers and bites. Lactobacillus spp. were mainly isolated from abscesses, aspiration pneumonia, bacteraemia and conjunctivitis. Most (> 90%) infections from which these species were isolated were polymicrobial and yielded a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The organisms most commonly isolated with the non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infection and skin and soft tissue infection around the rectal area, whereas most Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. The predisposing conditions associated with the isolation of non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were previous surgery, malignancy, steroid therapy and immunodeficiency. Antimicrobial therapy was given to 149 (83%) of the 160 patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 89 (56%).
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. RESULTS: The predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Peptostreptococcus species. Four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (BLPOs) were isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 BLPOs were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). The predominant BLPOs in acute sinusitis were H influenzae, and M catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella species, Fusobacterium species, and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained BLPOs. The detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of BLPOs in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against clinical isolates].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients in 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for CAM and the control drugs. The results were as follows; 1. MIC50 and MIC90 of CAM were similar to those investigated in 1980's against many bacterial species. 2. CAM showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and Peptostreptococcus spp. 3. It appears that resistance to MLs including CAM is increasing among Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from Taiwan.
AB  - To determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from Taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most of the tested bacteria. The MIC90s for Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. The MIC50s for methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. For S. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and B. fragilis, the MIC50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. The resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. Around 55% of S. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of S. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.
TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of teicoplanin in the treatment of infections.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic whose activity is selectively oriented against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Clostridium difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Corynebacterium jeikeium; such activity is affected by neither methicillin resistance nor beta-lactamase production. Teicoplanin is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; consequently, it has to be administered intravenously (either by infusion or by rapid injection) or intramuscularly. Its long half-life allows regimens based upon once daily administration. The adverse effects most frequently associated with teicoplanin treatment are local and hypersensitivity reactions, such as itching and drug fever; anaphylactoid reactions (the 'red man syndrome') are seldom observed. Teicoplanin also has less potential than vancomycin to cause nephrotoxicity, especially when administered in combination with an aminoglycoside. Teicoplanin has been proven to be effective in the treatment of microbiologically documented Gram-positive infections, including 'difficult to treat infections' such as endocarditis and prosthetic infections. Furthermore, recent trials in patients with haematological malignancies or other cancers have clearly demonstrated that teicoplanin is at least as efficacious as vancomycin in the empirical initial antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients, and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Finally, owing to its good tolerability profile and the advantage of once daily administration by both intravenous and intramuscular routes, teicoplanin has proven to be very useful for the outpatient treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. In conclusion, teicoplanin is potentially an effective alternative to vancomycin both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the advantage over vancomycin of single daily dose administration and lower toxicity. Further comparative studies with vancomycin are, however, required to better define the therapeutic role of teicoplanin for particular infections (i.e. infective endocarditis).
TI  - Microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  - Specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. Polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. A total of 102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (16 isolates). Peptostreptococcus spp. (14), Enterococcus spp. (14), Bacteroides spp. (12) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. The presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of E. coli and Bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric leakage (p < 0.05). Bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of E. coli and one each of B. fragilis and S. aureus. All patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - The microbiological and clinical characteristics of 83 patients with necrotizing  fasciitis (NF) treated over a period of 17 years are presented. Bacterial growth was noted in 81 of 83 (98%) of specimens from patients with NF. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 8 (10%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 18 (22%) specimens, and mixed-aerobic-anaerobic floras were recovered in 55 (68%) specimens. In total, there were 375 isolates, 105 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 270 anaerobic bacteria, for an average of 4.6 isolates per specimen. The recovery of certain bacteria from different anatomical locations correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. Anaerobic bacteria outnumbered aerobic bacteria at all body sites, but the highest recovery rate of anaerobes was in the buttocks, trunk, neck, external genitalia, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14 isolates), Escherichia coli (n = 12), and group A streptococci (n = 8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 101), Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (n = 40), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 36), and Clostridium spp. (n = 23). Certain clinical findings correlated with some bacteria: edema with B. fragilis group, Clostridium spp., S. aureus, Prevotella spp. and group A streptococci; gas and crepitation in tissues with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium spp.; and foul odor with Bacteroides spp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with some organisms: trauma with Clostridium spp.; diabetes with Bacteroides spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and S. aureus; and immunosuppression and malignancy with Pseudomonas spp. and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of NF.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Changes in the core tonsillar bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis: 1977-1993.
AB  - Microbiological studies of the core of tonsils removed from children with recurrent tonsillitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were conducted during three periods, with 50 patients in each period: 1977-1978 (period 1), 1984-1985 (period 2), and 1992-1993 (period 3). Mixed flora were present in all tonsils, with 8.1 organisms per tonsil (3.8 aerobes and 4.3 anaerobes). The predominant isolates in each period were Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Peptostreptococcus species, pigmented Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species, and Fusobacterium species. The rate of recovery of Haemophilus influenzae type b increased from 24% in period 1 to 76% in period 2 (P < .001); a decline to 12% in period 3 correlated with a concomitant increase in the frequency of recovery of non-type b strains of H. influenzae from 4% and 10% in periods 1 and 2, respectively, to 64% in period 3 (P < .001). Both the rate of recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and the number of these organisms per tonsil increased over time. Specifically, beta-lactamase-producing strains were detected in 37 tonsils (74%) during period 1, in 46 tonsils (92%) during period 2, and in 47 tonsils (94%) during period 3, and the number of such strains per tonsil increased from 1.1 in period 1 to 2.9 and 3.3 in periods 2 and 3, respectively.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - The role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  - This study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive surgical infections. A dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. It was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. Therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. The times above the MIC in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: Escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; Haemophilus spp., 12 h; Proteus mirabilis, 12 h; Klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; Providencia spp., 9.2 h; Clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; Peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all S. aureus, 6.8 h. From the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the Gram-negative anaerobes. For those infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  - AIMS: The study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. METHODS: The normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined preoperatively. Swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) in 90%, Propionibacterium acnes in 62%, Corynebacterium sp in 18%, and Peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. The lower fornices of 70% had CNS, 47% P acnes, 6% Staphylococcus aureus, 6% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Candida. RESULTS: A sterile PMMA intraocular lens was touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. Eighty two per cent of lenses grew CNS, 18% P acnes, 18% Bacillus sp, 12% S aureus, and 6% Corynebacterium sp. A second sterile PMMA intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. Forty seven per cent of these cultured CNS, 12% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Bacillus sp. A high count of bacteria in the operating field, especially CNS and P acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Special measures are needed before and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. Use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma.
AB  - Otitis media (OM), a common infection in children, can cause significant morbidity. Selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen directed against the pathogens responsible for the OM can minimize complications. The most frequently isolated bacteria from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are Peptostreptococcus spp., pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. Many of the organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, which can contribute to the failure of penicillins therapy. The appropriate surgical and medical therapy for chronic OM is reviewed.
TI  - Nonpuerperal breast infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We undertook a microbiological study of purulent specimens from women  with symptomatic breast abscesses. METHODS: Fifty-one purulent samples were collected in 2 periods (December 1991-April 1992 and January 1994-June 1994) from nonpuerperal breast abscesses in 44 patients attending our hospital. RESULTS: One of the most frequently isolated microorganisms was Proteus mirabilis (9 patients, 20.4%), present as a pure culture in all but 1 specimen (isolated together with Peptostreptococcus spp.). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 10 specimens, 6 of which were post-tumorectomy abscesses. Polymicrobial anaerobic flora were isolated in 11 specimens (21.5%); Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (8%); and Streptococcus milleri,Alcaligenes sp., and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 1 specimen each. The 7 remaining samples (13.7%) were negative bacteriological cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We draw attention to the frequent isolation of P. mirabilis in recurrent and torpid breast abscesses in 4 women in whom surgery was necessary in addition to antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in Surabaya, Indonesia.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from Surabaya, Indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. A total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57 aerobic) were recovered. Aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Fusobacterium sp. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. These findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM in children from Indonesia. Judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Distribution of clindamycin in cortical bone during direct local infusion of the  canine tibia.
AB  - The distribution of clindamycin in tibial cortical bone, administered via direct  local infusion with an implantable pump, is described. Clindamycin concentrations in cortical bone were measured after 3, 7, and 21 days of intraosseous infusion. The tibia were divided into four quadrants relative to the outflow infusion catheter site located in the medial aspect of the mid-diaphysis. A gradient of 5-30 mm from the infusion site was documented in all four quadrants (proximal lateral, proximal medial, distal lateral, and distal medial). At all sampling times, clindamycin concentrations in all quadrants exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations for gram-positive aerobic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, and both the gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes, including Peptostreptococcus species and Bacteroides species. The data suggest that gravitational forces affect the diffusion of the clindamycin because concentrations in both distal quadrants were greater than in corresponding proximal quadrants.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotic treatment in therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP:  results of a randomized controlled clinical study.
AB  - The present study evaluated the effects of prophylactic administration of cefotaxime in patients undergoing therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP. One hundred patients were randomized to two groups of 50 patients each. Patients in group 1 received an intravenous infusion of 2 g cefotaxime 15 minutes before endoscopy; patients in group 2 did not receive an intravenous antibiotic before ERCP (control group). Blood samples were drawn for bacteriologic cultures before endoscopy and 5, 15, 30, and 120 minutes after beginning the procedure. Bacteremia was detected by blood cultures (15- and 30-minute samples) in 4 patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (Escherichia coli in 2 cases, Peptostreptococcus in 1, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1). Cholangitis or sepsis did not occur after the bacteremic episodes in any of these patients. In 4 other patients who did not receive cefotaxime-all of whom had biliary obstruction-clinical cholangitis or sepsis developed during the 3-day follow-up; ERCP had failed to decompress the biliary system completely in these 4 cases. Blood cultures identified bacteria in 3 of these 4 patients (Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, E. coli in 2). Thus, bacteremia or clinical sepsis developed in 8/50 patients (16%) in the control group without antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas no such episode was observed in patients who had received prophylactic treatment (chi 2 = 8.7; p < 0.01). The present results indicate that prophylactic administration of an antibiotic such as cefotaxime can reduce the incidence of bacteremia and sepsis in patients who undergo therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The clinical importance of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1987.
AB  - The clinical importance of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) isolated in 1987 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, is assessed. Of about 800 anaerobic isolates, 209 (27%) were GPAC, of which 67 (32%) were from abscesses and 22 (11%) were in pure growth. Four species comprised 77% of the 168 isolates available for study: Peptostreptococcus magnus (55 isolates, 33%), P. micros (23, 14%), P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) and P. anaerobius (27, 16%). Different species were associated with different sites, from P. magnus (usually skin-associated sites; normally cultured with aerobes, infrequently with other anaerobes), P. asaccharolyticus (distributed widely) and P. anaerobius (usually genitourinary and gastrointestinal; always below the diaphragm) to P. micros (always deep sites with other anaerobes). P. magnus was isolated from 15 abscesses and was obtained in pure culture from 11 specimens, six of them abscesses developing from infected sebaceous cysts. P. micros was usually isolated from soft tissue abscesses, never from the skin, and with a characteristic mixed flora consisting of "Streptococcus milleri" and anaerobic gram-negative rods. P. heliotrinreducens was a rare isolate from similar specimens. P. asaccharolyticus was cultured from a wide variety of sites, typically mixed with both aerobes and anaerobes, and frequently from abscesses. Most isolates of P. anaerobius came from gastrointestinal or female genitourinary specimens, never from above the diaphragm and rarely from the skin; cultures were usually heavily mixed. Isolates of P. vaginalis and the "bGAL" group made up 11% of str ains and were usally cultured from superficial sites, P. vaginalis often from post-operative wound infections with Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis in patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although patients with cirrhosis have an increased susceptibility for  bacterial infections, endocarditis complicating cirrhosis has been reported only infrequently. In this study, our objective was to determine whether, bacterial endocarditis is, in fact, a complicating factor in cirrhosis. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all cases of bacterial endocarditis that occurred over the last 15 yr in patients with known cirrhosis. RESULTS: Ten patients (three males, seven females) were identified, whose mean age was 55 yr (range 29-65 yr). Bacterial organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-positive (eight patients), Peptostreptococcus (one patient), and Enterococcus (one patient). Underlying liver disease consisted of alcoholism (five patients), autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (two), cryptogenic cirrhosis (two), and primary biliary cirrhosis (one). Distribution of heart valves affected were mitral valve (six), aorta (two), and there were two involving both mitral and aortic valves. Echocardiograms revealed vegetation in 50% of the patients. Laboratory studies were markedly abnormal, with mean values of albumin 2.4 mg/dl, creatinine 2.5 mg/dl, BUN 76.5 mg/dl, and total bilirubin 8.2 mg/dl. Potential associated sources of infection were upper gastrointestinal bleeding (four), pneumonia (two), and one each of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hip replacement, heart catheterization, and abdominal abscess. The outcome was poor, with death in eight of 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial endocarditis may complicate cirrhosis, may be more frequent in females, typically involves the mitral valve, and probably is due to Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

AB  - To investigate the antibiotic activity of cefteram (CFTM), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CFTM and of the control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from November 1991 to April 1993 from 19 dental facilities throughout the country, as well as against clinically isolated strains from samples obtained at this center from patients with dental infectious diseases, and the following results were obtained. 1. 430 strains were detected in 198 cases but identified strains amounted to 425. They are comprised of 204 strains of oral streptococci (48.0%), 81 strains of Peptostreptococcus spp. (19.1%), 10 strains of Bacteroides spp. (2.4%), 23 strains of Prevotella spp. (5.4%), and 9 strains of Porphyromonas spp. (2.1%). The ratios of Gram-positive bacteria v.s. Gram-negative bacteria were 78.4% and 21.6%, respectively, and the Gram-positive bacteria were isolated at higher frequency than Gram-negative bacteria. 2. The MIC90's of CFTM against oral streptococci and Peptostreptococcus spp. were 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.05 microgram/ml, and year to year increases of incidences of resistance against CFTM were not observed. Some strains, however, appeared to have obtained resistance to CFTM. 3. Among Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp. which used to belong to genus Bacteroides, there were some strains resistant to CFTM. As a whole, however, no year to year increases in the incidence of CFTM resistance among these strains also. 4. Two strains of 6 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus were methicillin-resistant. 5. The above observations indicate that CFTM still shows strong antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated strains that may be involved in dental infections.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in liver abscesses in children.
AB  - Aspirates from pyogenic liver abscesses obtained from 14 children were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of 29 organisms that were recovered, 17 were anaerobic and 12 were aerobic or facultative. The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates). Bacteroides fragilis group (4), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in five cases, anaerobic bacteria only in four and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in five. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered in liver abscesses that were associated with other infection in which these organisms were predominant (i.e. abdominal infection, abscesses). This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in pyogenic liver abscess.
TI  - Role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  - Periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. Although a specificity to some degree is found for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. What we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. This hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. Some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. Microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in LJP patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. Suspected pathogens (risk markers) are Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroidesforsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. The presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and AIDS--or with implants.
TI  - Lung abscess: analysis of 66 cases from 1979 to 1991.
AB  - Sixty-six patients with bacterial lung abscess were treated between 1979 and 1991 in our hospital. Among these patients, death occurred in one of the 42 cases of community-acquired infection (mortality rate: 2.4%) and in 16 of the 24 cases of nosocomial infection (mortality rate: 66.7%). Of all 66 cases, 55 were culture-positive, and the etiologic agents isolated from 24 of the culture-positive cases were found to be anaerobic bacteria. The most common aerobes isolated from the foci were identified as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most common anaerobes were Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium spp., microaerophilic Streptococcus and Veillonella. The mortality was higher in the cases with P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Candida spp. than in those with other bacteria. The prognosis of lung abscess patients proved to depend on the presence of underlying diseases and on superinfection with aerobes.
TI  - Microbial composition and pattern of antibiotic resistance in subgingival microbial samples from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - A series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. In descending order of prevalence the associated microbiota included Bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), Fusobacterium species (68%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (63%), Campylobacter rectus (47%), Capnocytophaga species (38%), Prevotella intermedia (23%), Peptostreptococcus micros (18%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), Candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), Staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). Eikenella corrodens (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and Enterococcus species (< 1%). Antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin G, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, Fusobacterium species, Capnocytophaga species, Staphylococcus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. It was largely absent for Campylobacter rectus. No antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for Porphyromonas gingivalis or Bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. The results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. Diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - T-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, and Moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Peptostreptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of T-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. When administered orally, T-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vivo activity of T-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. The activities of T-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of T-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of external otitis.
AB  - Microbiological and clinical data from 46 patients with external otitis were retrospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 42 aerobic bacteria, 22 anaerobic bacteria, and 3 Candida albicans organisms were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 31 patients (67%), anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 8 (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 4 (9%). C. albicans alone was recovered from two patients (4%), and the organism was mixed with aerobic bacteria in one case (2%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 instances), Peptostreptococcus species (11), Staphylococcus aureus (7), and Bacteroides species (5). One isolate was recovered from 30 patients (65%), 2 isolates were recovered from 11 (24%), and 3 isolates were recovered from 5 (11%). beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 32 isolates recovered from 27 specimens (59%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of external otitis in one-third of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in one-quarter of them. Further prospective studies are warranted for evaluating the role of anaerobic bacteria in this infection and the therapeutic implications of these findings.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria growth was obtained in 58. Aerobic facultative bacteria or Candida sp. only were present in 28 patients (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). Ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) Candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), Streptococcus sp. (16), and Escherichia coli (6). The predominant anaerobes included Bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 Bacteroides fragilis group) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (11). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were S. aureus. Twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. These included 16 S. aureus and 6 B. fragilis group. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of parotitis.
AB  - Of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. Infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. Assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. Viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus (mumps), Epstein-Barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza A and parainfluenza viruses. Acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and rarely, gram-negative bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria, mostly Peptostreptococcus species and Bacteroides species, and pigmented Porphyromonas species and Prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. beta-Lactamase-producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients. Predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms, immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. Pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. Initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. Surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. This may prevent complications and facilitate recovery.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Analysis of 98 cases of thoracic empyema].
AB  - Ninety-eight cases of empyema thoracis admitted to Juntendo University Hospital between 1979 and 1990 were reviewed. Males accounted for 78 cases and females 20 cases. Thirteen pediatric patients ranged in age from 17 days to 4 years, while the 85 adult cases ranged from 16 to 89 years (mean: 58.4 years). The mortality rate increased with age. Fifty-three cases of community-acquired empyema thoracis consisted of 24 with no underlying disease (including 13 pediatric cases), and 29 with diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver damage or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Forty-five nosocomial empyema cases occurred after chest operation or thoracocentesis, or due to a subdiaphragmatic pathogenic condition or congestive heart failure complicated with aspiration pneumonia. In this series, 63 patients (64.3%) had para- or post-pneumonic empyema. Compared with the community-acquired infection cases, the mortality rate of the nosocomial infection cases was very high. Seventy-eight cases were culture-positive, including 3 positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The remaining 20 cases were culture-negative. In 75 cases of culture-positive pleural fluid, aerobic bacteria were isolated from 31 cases (mortality rate: 22.6%), anaerobes mixed with aerobes from 21 cases (mortality rate: 52.4%), and anaerobes only from 23 cases (mortality rate: 21.7%). Thus, the mortality rate of mixed infected cases was highest. Anaerobes were frequently isolated from the community-acquired empyema cases, and were often found in para- or postpneumonic lesions, including aspiration pneumonia. The most commonly encountered aerobe was Staphylococcus aureus. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroides spp., microaerophilic streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. were most common. A single organism was isolated in pure culture from 39 cases. Single organisms isolated from fluids were more frequently aerobes (25) than anaerobes (14). The cases harboring Bacteroides spp. showed the worst outcome, with 11 deaths in 25 such cases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in Sweden.
AB  - Bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in Sweden. Streptococci, e.g. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. Bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). When the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, May 15 to October 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). These figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. Whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of A. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. There were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas Str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. This and other Swedish investigations support the theory that A. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on Str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. It is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - Thirty-four aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses that were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. A total 107 bacterial isolates (58 anaerobic and 49 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 3.1 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 1.4 aerobic and facultatives). Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (18%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 2 (6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 26 (76%). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 4 infections, 2 of which were Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 were anaerobic bacteria. The predominant bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), Bacteroides sp (21 isolates, including 15 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp (16) and S. pyogenes (10). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 13 (52%) of 25 specimens tested. This retrospective study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Microbiological studies of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Specimens from 58 children with decubitus ulcers were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 29 (50%) ulcers, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 5 (9%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 24 (41%). A total of 132 isolates (79 aerobes, 53 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes, 0.9 anaerobes). The smallest number of isolates was recovered in ulcers of the skull (1.7 per site), and the highest number of isolates was found in ulcers of the buttocks (4.1 per site). The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (25 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (22), Bacteroides fragilis group (10), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7). Forty-two of the organisms isolated from 38 (66%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Most of the S aureus isolates were recovered from ulcers of the hand and the leg. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the ulcer predominated in the wounds next to these areas. Enteric gram-negative rods, group D streptococci, and B fragilis group predominated in ulcers of the buttocks. Group A streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, and Fusobacterium species were most frequently recovered in ulcers of the skull. The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the ulcer are demonstrated.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute suppurative parotitis.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from acute suppurative parotitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was present in 23 specimens. A total of 36 bacterial isolates (20 anaerobic and 16 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (0.9 anaerobic and 0.7 aerobic and facultative). Anaerobic bacteria only were present in 10 (43%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 10 (43%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 3 (13%). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 9 infections, 6 of which were Staphylococcus aureus and 3 were anaerobic bacteria. The predominant bacterial isolates were S. aureus (8 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (6 isolates, including 4 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (5). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 11 (73%) of the 15 specimens tested. This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute suppurative parotitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of 584 wounds and 676 skin or soft-tissue abscesses were studied and correlated with the infection site. In wounds, aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 223 specimens (38%), anaerobes only in 177 specimens (30%), and mixed flora in 184 specimens (32%). In total there were 1470 isolates, 558 aerobic and 912 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per wound (1.6 anaerobic and 0.9 aerobic isolates). In abscesses, aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 177 specimens (26%), anaerobes only in 243 specimens (36%), and mixed flora in 256 specimens (38%). In total there were 1702 isolates, 602 aerobic and 1100 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per abscess. The highest rates of anaerobes in wounds were in the inguinal, buttocks, and trunk areas and in abscesses in the perirectal, external genitalia, neck, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (363 isolates), group A streptococci (98 isolates), and Escherichia coli (97 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides species (986 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (559 isolates), Clostridium species (153 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (109 isolates). The predominance of certain isolates in certain anatomical sites was correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.
TI  - Protein L. A bacterial Ig-binding protein that activates human basophils and mast cells.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus magnus strain 312 (10(6) to 10(8)/ml), which synthesizes a protein capable of binding to kappa L chains of human Ig (protein L), stimulated the release of histamine from human basophils in vitro. P. magnus strain 644, which does not synthesize protein L, did not induce histamine secretion. Soluble protein L (3 x 10(-2) to 3 micrograms/ml) induced histamine release from human basophils. The characteristics of the release reaction were similar to those of rabbit IgG anti-Fc fragment of human IgE (anti-IgE): it was Ca2(+)- and temperature-dependent, optimal release occurring at 37 degrees C in the presence of 1.0 mM extracellular Ca2+. There was an excellent correlation (r = 0.82; p less than 0.001) between the maximal percent histamine release induced by protein L and that induced by anti-IgE, as well as between protein L and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (r = 0.52; p less than 0.01). Preincubation of basophils with either protein L or anti-IgE resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus. IgE purified from myeloma patients PS and PP (lambda-chains) blocked anti-IgE-induced histamine release but failed to block the histamine releasing activity of protein L. In contrast, IgE purified from myeloma patient ADZ (kappa-chains) blocked both anti-IgE- and protein L-induced releases, whereas human polyclonal IgG selectively blocked protein L-induced secretion. Protein L acted as a complete secretagogue, i.e., it activated basophils to release sulfidopeptide leukotriene C4 as well as histamine. Protein L (10(-1) to 3 micrograms/ml) also induced the release of preformed (histamine) and de novo synthesized mediators (leukotriene C4 and/or PGD2) from mast cells isolated from lung parenchyma and skin tissues. Intradermal injections of protein L (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml) in nonallergic subjects caused a dose-dependent wheal-and-flare reaction. Protein L activates human basophils and mast cells in vitro and in vivo presumably by interacting with kappa L chains of the IgE isotype.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Management of empyema thoracis.
AB  - Over a 5-year period, 65 adult patients with empyema thoracis were treated. The cause of the empyema was postpneumonic in 52%, postresectional in 24%, a complication of minor surgical procedures in 14%, posttraumatic in 5%, and the result of miscellaneous causes in 5%. In the postpneumonic group, infection resulted from a single aerobic organism in 41%, multiple aerobic organisms in 9%, single anaerobic organisms in 12%, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic organisms in 18%. Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were the most common organisms, accounting for 55% of bacterial isolates. All 34 patients with postpneumonic empyema were initially treated with drainage, which was successful in two thirds. The remainder, 12 patients, ultimately required thoracotomy. Decortication was combined with intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscles in 9 patients. There was no reoperation or recurrence of infection, and thoracoplasty was avoided; residual spaces were filled by the transposed muscle.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Clindamycin versus ampicillin in the treatment of odontogenic infections.
AB  - The subjects were 106 patients, aged 14 to 70 years, with acute facial or oral abscesses originating from an odontogenic source. They were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg of clindamycin or 250 mg of ampicillin orally four times daily for seven days. After seven days of treatment, the infections were eradicated in 36 of the 52 clindamycin-treated patients and in 42 of the 54 ampicillin-treated patients, and improved in 16 and 11, respectively. One of the ampicillin group was a treatment failure. Mixed bacterial infections were found in most of the patients; 385 isolates were identified, 167 aerobes and 218 anaerobes. The most common aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (in 58 patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis (in 47), and Staphylococcus viridans (in 32); the most common anaerobes were species of Peptococcus (in 76), Bacteroides (in 38), and Peptostreptococcus (in 33). No isolates were resistant to clindamycin; nine of 126 aerobes and six of 160 anaerobes were resistant to ampicillin. It is concluded that clindamycin is a safe and effective alternative antibiotic in the treatment of odontogenic infections.
TI  - Cephalexin concentrations in human serum, gingiva, and mandibular bone following  a single oral administration.
AB  - 1. Cephalexin concentrations in human serum, gingiva, and mandibular bone after a single oral administration of cephalexin (500 mg) were measured by the paper disc method. 2. The peak times of serum, gingiva, and mandibular bone were approximately 90, 120 and 120 min, respectively. 3. The peak concentrations of serum, gingiva, and mandibular bone were 10.58 micrograms/ml, 5.57 micrograms/g and 2.12 micrograms/g, respectively. 4. The concentration ratio of gingiva/serum and mandibular bone/serum peak time of serum were 0.47 and 0.18, respectively. 5. Cephalexin concentrations in gingiva and mandibular bond did not exceed the MIC80s for clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus spp., alpha-Streptococci and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - [Effect of helium-neon-laser radiation on microbes].
AB  - In a well-defined in-vitro experiment the effects of a He-Ne-laser of 6 mW output on some dominating microbes in the oral cavity were studied by using a scanning electron microscope. No changes on the surface in the irradiated colonies could be seen even after an exposition lasting for 60 minutes (continuous or pulsated wave). Therefore an antibacterial effect of softlaser-irradiation sometimes described in literature in questionable.
TI  - Microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  - Specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). A total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes and 153 aerobes) were recovered. An average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. However, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group A streptococcus (9 isolates), and Escherichia coli (7 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and Bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 Bacteroides fragilis groups). The study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Microbiology of wound infection after head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  - Specimens of pus were obtained from 24 patients who developed postoperative wound infection after head and neck cancer surgery. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in two instances (8%), anaerobic bacteria only in one (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 21 (88%). A total of 146 isolates were recovered (66 aerobic and 80 anaerobic), an average of six isolates per specimen (2.7 aerobic and 3.3 anaerobic). The most frequently recovered isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium, and enteric gram-negative rods. Twenty-two isolates recovered from 17 wounds (71%) produced beta-lactamase. These included all five isolates of S aureus and nine of 17 (53%) of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The polymicrobial aerobic/anaerobic nature of postoperative wound infections after head and neck cancer surgery and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria may have important implications for the management of these infections.
TI  - Microbiology of postthoractomy sternal wound infection.
AB  - Specimens from 74 patients with postthoractomy sternal wound infection were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was obtained in specimens from 65 patients (88%). Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 50 specimens (77%), anaerobic bacteria only in 6 (9%), and mixed aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (14%). Eighty-seven isolates were recovered (1.3 per specimen): 68 aerobic or facultative (1.0 per specimen) and 19 anaerobic (0.3 per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (21 isolates), and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (14 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (10 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (4 isolates), and Clostridium spp. (3 isolates). Polymicrobial infection occurred in 18 instances (28%). A single organisms was recovered in 47 instances (72%); these included 20 isolates of S. epidermidis, 15 of S. aureus, 5 of Enterobacteriaceae, and 4 of anaerobes. These data highlight the previously unrecognized polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology in a percentage of patients with postthoractomy sternal wound infection.
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in brain abscess, a review; observation of 18 consecutive cases.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of 18 consecutive cases of brain abscesses were studied. Two cases were sterile. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate the organism being Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, Bacteroides fragilis in two cases and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. In the remaining eleven cases, more than one organism was isolated. A combination of anaerobe with an aerobe was observed in five cases and infections with more than one anaerobe in as many as six cases. Anaerobic organisms are the important pathogens in brain abscess and occurrence of infections by more than one organism is a common factor.
TI  - Comparative activities of cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from bite wounds.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activities of 10 oral antimicrobial agents against 147 aerobic and 61 anaerobic bacteria making up species in 13 genera (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus-Actinobacillus spp., M-5, EF-4, Moraxella spp., Flavobacterium IIb, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp.) that were isolated from bite wounds. Cefuroxime was generally greater than fourfold more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against all aerobic isolates, including Pasteurella multocida. The fluoroquinolones were highly active against most aerobic isolates but were less active against anaerobic isolates. Ciprofloxacin was generally more active than either enoxacin or ofloxacin. Discrepancies of greater than 30% in the interpretation of susceptibilities between break points suggested by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and those related to oral dose peak levels (one-half to one-quarter of maximum achievable concentrations) were noted in 14% (18 of 130) of the instances.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology. Study group of cefuzonam in the field of obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - A multi-center open study was conducted to investigate cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) regarding to its pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical aspects in the field of obstetrics and gynecology with the participation of 31 medical institutions and the related facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Peak MICs of CZON for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase (-) staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis group, Peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections with relatively high frequencies were 0.39, 0.20, 0.024, 0.024-0.05, 12.5, 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively, with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. 2. When 1 g of CZON was given through bolus injection, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of CZON in pelvic dead space exudate was 18.7 micrograms/ml at 60.9 minutes (Tmax) after the injection; Cmax's in all female genital tissues were observed at 0.6-27.9 minutes and ranged from 11.9-26.3 micrograms/g. The Cmax 8.3 micrograms/ml, in the pelvic dead space exudate was noted at 97.0 minutes after the end of the intravenous drip infusion of 1 g over 1 hour, and Cmax's in genital tissues were 14.3-30.0 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. With 1 hour drip infusion of 2 g, Cmax's in genital tissues were 35.0-53.9 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. 3. The clinical efficacy of CZON was evaluated in 206 evaluable patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Efficacy rates classified by types of infections were 97.1% (67/69) for intrauterine infections, 81.6% (31/38) for intrapelvic infections, 91.8% (45/49) for adnexitis, 95.2% (20/21) for infections of the external genital organs and 86.2% (25/29) for other infections. 4. Side effects were observed in 7 of the 262 patients: eruption in 6 cases, itching in 2, diarrhea in 1. Abnormal laboratory test values were noted in 9 of the 256 patients. Most of them were slight elevation of hepatic function values. CZON showed satisfactory clinical efficacy and potent antibacterial activity, hence it appears that CZON will be a very useful antibiotic for obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefotetan once daily and cefoxitin thrice daily for the treatment of infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
TI  - Microbiological and clinical aspects of aspiration pneumonia.
AB  - Aspiration pneumonia is characterized by a pneumonitis in a dependent segment of  the lung with typical necrosis or abscess-formation in the parenchyma. Observed aspiration or predisposition to aspiration, cavitation or abscess formation, with or without empyema fluid and isolation of distinctive micro-organisms are important clues to the diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures to collect anaerobic uncontaminated secretions are transtracheal aspiration, blood cultures, pleural fluid aspiration, fibreoptic bronchoscopic protected investigations and percutaneous transthoracic aspiration. Leading pathogens in more than 90% are anaerobic bacteria, mostly species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus; aerobic bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, mainly Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment depends on bacteriological results; penicillin G and clindamycin are the most useful antibiotics against anaerobes and should be administered over a long period of time (4-12 weeks), adjusted to the clinical course of the individual patient.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - Cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. Microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. A total of 98 isolates (3.9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. Seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. The organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Bacteroides spp. The organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). These findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.
TI  - Microbiological studies of tracheostomy site wounds.
AB  - Specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered in 19 (76%). A total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). The most frequently recovered isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Fusobacterium sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. These included all isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.
TI  - [Studies on antimicrobial concentrations of flomoxef in serum, pelvic dead space  exudate, and pelvic organs/tissues].
AB  - To women undergoing radical and total hysterectomy, flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) in a  dose of 2 g was administered by intravenous drip infusion over 1 hour and drug concentrations in serum and pelvic dead space exudate as well as pelvic organs/tissues were determined over time. The following results were obtained: 1. Serum concentrations of FMOX after intravenous infusion showed the peak value of 92.86 +/- 17.05 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion and then gradually decreased to 29.00 +/- 10.49 micrograms/ml in 1 hour and 1.16 +/- 1.08 micrograms/ml in 6 hours. 2. Concentrations in pelvic dead space exudate, which were 6.54 +/- 3.21 micrograms/ml at the end of intravenous infusion, gradually increased to 31.28 +/- 12.69 micrograms/ml in 30 minutes, and the peak of 35.21 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml in 1 hour. Exudate concentrations gradually decreased to 11.10 +/- 6.64 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after infusion. 3. The serum concentration at the ligature of uterine artery was 103.21 +/- 51.69 micrograms/ml. Among concentrations in pelvic organ/tissues 37.17 +/- 18.20 micrograms/ml in uterine cervix was the highest, followed by 35.77 +/- 7.68 micrograms/g in portio vaginalis, 26.35 +/- 14.15 micrograms/g in tube, 21.62 +/- 12.15 micrograms/g in ovary, 20.56 +/- 9.82 micrograms/g in myometrium, and 16.45 +/- 8.10 micrograms/g in endometrium, in this order. 4. From an analysis of the two-compartment model, the maximum serum concentration was 92.81 micrograms/ml, which was very high. The time of 50% reduction of concentration in beta phase was 1.21 hours. In the pelvic dead space exudate, the maximum concentration was 32.38 micrograms/ml and the time of 50% reduction was 2.44 hours. The AUC was 147 micrograms.hr/ml in serum and 201 micrograms.hr/ml in the pelvic dead space. The shift to the pelvic dead space was 137% when AUC's were used as the basis of the comparison. 5. Clinically, FMOX was excellently effective against adnexitis caused by Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, intrauterine infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, cystitis caused by Klebsiella and Escherichia coli, vaginal stump infection caused by Streptococcus and E. coli and many other infections.
TI  - Microbiology of retropharyngeal abscesses in children.
AB  - Aspiration of retropharyngeal abscesses was performed in 14 children. Cultures were taken from aspirates for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and all yielded bacterial growth. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; they were the only organisms isolated in two patients (14%) and were mixed with aerobes in 12 patients (86%). There were 78 anaerobic isolates (5.6 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. There were 26 aerobic isolates (1.9 per specimen). The predominant aerobes were alpha- and gamma-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus species, and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. beta-Lactamase production was noted in 16 isolates recovered from ten patients (71%). These included all isolates of S aureus, six of 18 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (33%), and two of three Bacteroides oralis (67%). These findings demonstrate the major role of anaerobic organisms in retropharyngeal abscesses and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  - The present study was initiated to determine the bacteriology of 40 orofacial abscesses of dental origin in patients who had taken antibiotics for several days. Bacteria were isolated from all but 2 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 cases, obligate anaerobic bacteria in 17 cases, whereas in 11 cases, polymicrobial growth was revealed. The average number of bacterial species was 2.1 per specimen. Gram positive aerobic micro-organisms predominated, namely, Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Streptococci (group A) and Staphylococcus aureus. Among obligate anaerobes, Gram positive micro-organisms, peptostreptococci and peptococci were more often isolated, in the following decreasing order: Ps. productus, Ps. intermedius, Ps. parvulus, Ps. anaerobius, Pc. constellatus, Pc. prevotii. Gram negative anaerobic rods were detected in a small number of cases, namely B. corrodens, B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, B. oralis. Quantitative determination did not show any meaningful difference between aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Susceptibility tests against a series of antibiotics showed that ampicillin was the most active in aerobes and cefoxitin in anaerobes.

AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). Moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. Of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. On combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. The combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. Secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. Rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. In combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. In subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. Of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. Synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. Using this combination, secondary resistance of Pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. When ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - [Studies of isolated organisms from otorhinolaryngological infections and their susceptibilities to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  - To study current situation of pathogenic bacteria and their drug resistance to macrolide antibiotics in the otorhinolaryngological infections, 609 strains diagnosed as pathogen derived from 463 patients were collected from cohospitals or institutions during the period of 1980-1983. The results obtained were as follows: Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was dominant (410 strains) and major species were S. aureus (135 strains), S. pneumoniae (81 strains), S. epidermidis (68 strains) and S. pyogenes (65 strains). In Gram-negative bacteria giving 147 strains and 43 strains, of anaerobes prevailing species were H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp. Representative species in the diseases were S. aureus (26.6%), S. epidermidis (24.5%), and P. aeruginosa (12.8%) in acute otitis media, S. aureus (34.4%), S. epidermidis (17.7%) and P. aeruginosa (14.6%) in acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, S. epidermidis (17.0%), S. aureus (16.1%) and H. influenzae (13.4%) in acute paranasal sinusitis, S. pyogenes (29.1%), S. pneumoniae (19.6%) and S. aureus (15.1%) in acute tonsillitis. Although most of isolates were susceptible to macrolides, 62 resistant strains to macrolides were found in 501 strains and the resistant rates were 26.7% in S. aureus, 23.1% in S. epidermidis and 6.5% in S. pyogenes. The resistant pattern was somewhat different against each macrolides, resistant strains giving over 100 micrograms/ml in MIC were 55/62 in erythromycin, 35/62 in josamycin and midecamycin and 7/62 in TMS-19-Q, a new macrolide.
TI  - [Non-puerperal mastitis. Etiology, clinical aspects and therapy].
AB  - Non-puerperal mastitis was diagnosed in 79 patients (aged 12-77 years) over the years 1974-1984. Malignant neoplasm was not present. Bacterial infection in the region of the areola was the most frequent finding (40%), followed by abacterial inflammation without involvement of the nipples (29%). The other cases, bacterial or nonbacterial, occurred at different sites. The histological picture or clinical features of an increased secretory activity of the mammary gland (galactorrhoea, mastodynia) in addition to the mastitis was noted in 54 women. Causative organisms were proven in 53% of cases: Staph. aureus (41%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (41%), or anaerobic organisms (11%). Physical measures, antibiotics and bromocriptine were used as treatment. At the onset of treatment abscesses were already present or developed in 34 instances. In 28 cases one to six recurrences set in after the end of the treatment period. In 22 patients treated with bromocriptine prophylactically there were only two recurrences. In the majority of patients an increased alveolar secretion was important in the pathogenesis of the bacterial or abacterial inflammation. Prolactin-lowering treatment seems reasonable by itself in cases of abacterial mastitis, or in combination with antibiotics in bacterial mastitis. Recurrences can be prevented by long-term lowering of the peripheral prolactin level.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). These included all eight isolates of S aureus and five B fragilis, and 11 of 24 B melaninogenicus group (46%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from infected aural fistulas.
AB  - Aural fistula is a congenital deformity of the external ear relatively common in  Orientals and rare in Caucasians. Suppuration tends to occur, and chemotherapy rather than surgical drainage should be attempted. However, the lack of information concerning infected aural fistulas has made appropriate chemotherapy difficult. Microorganisms isolated from 13 cases of infected aural fistulas were studied from January 1981 to December 1982. Six species and 22 strains were isolated; nonsporeforming faculative anaerobes were detected in 12 cases. The isolated pathogens included Peptococcus sp (10 cases), Peptostreptococcus sp (3), Bacteroides sp (3), and Fusobacterium sp (2). One case exhibited only Staphylococcus aureus. Our data also stresses the etiologic importance of anaerobic gram-positive cocci in infected aural fistulas.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  - The etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., Pasteurella multocida. While anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. Most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. In a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. Anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. Several species of anaerobes usually were present in the wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. The anaerobes most commonly isolated included Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides disiens, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides ruminicola, Bacteroides pneumosintes, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium russii, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Veillonella species. Initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.
TI  - Cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  - Hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. The search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. In this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. In each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained. All organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. In the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. After the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. This therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. In our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. In most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. All but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by Enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
TI  - Effects of atmosphere of incubation on recovery of bacteria and yeasts from blood cultures in Tryptic soy broth.
AB  - A comparison was made of the results of blood cultures between 1974 and 1981 in unvented and transiently vented bottles of Tryptic soy broth under vacuum with CO2. A total of 14,646 isolates were available for statistical analysis. Significantly more isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Neisseria, and Candida were recovered from the vented bottle. Significantly more isolates of Corynebacterium, Haemophilus, Flavobacterium, Moraxella, Bacteroidaceae, and Peptostreptococcus were recovered from the unvented bottle.
TI  - Susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  - The utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. With a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated with human brain abscess was determined. Two strains of Escherichia coli were more infective than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Even between the E. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. The E. coli strain with the K-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the E. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. The brain was also susceptible to Candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. Brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria associated with osteomyelitis in domestic animals.
AB  - Specimens of bony tissue or adjacent soft tissue from 19 animals with osteomyelitis were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Fourteen specimens (74%) yielded anaerobic bacteria in pure culture or mixed with aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The most predominant genus encountered was an obligate anaerobe, Bacteroides. The most frequently isolated Bacteroides species was Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, which was isolated 5 times. The most frequently isolated anaerobe was Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which was isolated 6 times. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria, with 7 and 6 isolates, respectively.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - [Nonclostridial anaerobic soft tissue infections].
AB  - Fourteen cases of nonclostridial anaerobic infections of soft tissues caused by peptococci, peptostreptococci, bacteroids or their combinations with E. coli, Proteus, and Staphylococcus aureus were studied. They are characterized by a rapid spread of serous-suppurative inflammation and the causative agents in loose fibrous connective tissue of subcutaneous adipose tissue (cellutitis), surface fascia (fasciitis), or skeletal muscles (myositis). Dissolution of intercellular structures of the connective tissue, extensive necroses, mild leukocyte reaction, and a wide peripheral zone of toxic edema are observed in the focus of inflammation. This is due to a high toxicity and enzymatic activity of the causative agents. Gas formation is observed when anaerobes are combined with E. coli.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology].
AB  - Clinical bacteriological studies on cefotiam and cefsulodin in the field of otorhinolaryngology were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were dominantly isolated from the clinical materials sent to the center from the clinical institutes. 2) It was considered that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and beta-Streptococcus played an important role in the primary infections in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Staphylococcus aureus was also frequently isolated from the primary infections. Peptostreptococcus spp. was dominantly isolated from peritonsillar abscess. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were mainly isolated from the chronic secondary infections. Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp. were more frequently isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was also constantly detected in the secondary infections together with GNB. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 20.1% of the patients with chronic otitis media and 27.1% of sinusitis. 3) Cefotiam showed potent antibacterial activities against most isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 4) Cefsulodin showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-Streptococcus were also susceptible to cefsulodin.
TI  - The fermentation of lactulose by colonic bacteria.
AB  - Sixty-four strains of intestinal bacteria were cultured under anaerobic conditions in lactulose-containing media to assess their ability to ferment lactulose. Some organisms were unable to metabolize the disaccharide, while others, e.g. clostridia and lactobacilli, metabolized lactulose extensively. Quantitative analyses of the fermentation products indicated that the major non-gaseous metabolites were acetic, lactic and butyric acids. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were the only gases detected. Fermentation products were estimated for selected species throughout their growth cycles. The products of fermentation of lactulose by stool cultures varied with incubation conditions such as pH, but correlated well with those produced by pure cultures. These results are discussed in relation to the therapeutic uses of lactulose.
TI  - Extensive botryomycosis in a patient with diabetes and chronic active hepatitis.
AB  - Extensive botryomycosis was diagnosed in a patient with diabetes mellitus with chronic active hepatitis. Peptostreptococcus organisms and Staphylococcus aureus grew from the sulfur granule cultures. The patient's neutrophils showed notable inhibition of chemotaxis toward endotoxin-activated normal serum. The patient's serum also had an inhibitor to neutrophil chemotaxis, This inhibiting substance was probably antistreptolysin O. Results of other tests of neutrophil function and skin tests to evaluate cell-mediated immunity were normal.
TI  - Bacteriologic study of paronychia in children.
AB  
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Bacterial interference between Clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  - Clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. It is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by C. difficile. The inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against C. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. Strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of C. difficile, with Lactobacillus organisms and group D enterococci displaying the most antagonistic activity. C. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. All eight strains of C. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera Bacteroides, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus.
TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis associated with anaerobic bacteremia.
AB  - Most episodes of acute suppurative parotitis are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Reported here is a patient who had acute parotitis associated with anaerobic sepsis caused by Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Peptostreptococcus micros. Acute parotitis should be included in the ever-widening spectrum of clinical infections caused by anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. Aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. There were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). The predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), Bacteroides fragilis (6), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4). The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (23), Group A beta hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus influenzae (5), and Enterobacter agglomerans (5). The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  - Needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). Sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. Aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). Mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group A beta hemolytic streptococci (8). A total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 Peptococcus sp. and 3 Peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 Bacteroides sp. (including 3 B. melaninogenicus), 5 Propionibacterium acnes, and 4 Fusobacterium nucleatum. These data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Pediatric infectious cervical lymphadenitis.
AB  - Infectious cervical lymphadenitis is a frequently encountered problem in the pediatric population. The recent experience with infectious cervical lymphadenitis at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was reviewed. The most common etiologic agent was Staphylococcus aureus. beta-Hemolytic streptococcus and mycobacterium were found in 15% and 6% of cases respectively. Other agents included pneumococcus, cat scratch, Toxoplasma gondii, actinomycosis, and mixed bacteroides and peptostreptococcus. Most patients responded to high-dose intravenous antistaphylococcal penicillin. Needle aspiration proved successful in identifying the casual agent in a high percentage of cases. Aspiration was also beneficial in draining small abscess cavities. Surgical drainage was rarely necessary.
TI  - Antigenic relationships and rapid identification of Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Antisera against whole cells of each Peptostreptococcus species (P. anaerobius, P. micros, P. parvulus, and P. productus) were produced in rabbits. When these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in Ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. When the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. These absorbed antisera, specific for each Peptostreptococcus species by Ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. Staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein A was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. These reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each Peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. No cross-reactions occurred with the Streptococcus intermedius, Peptococcus magnus, or Peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. Similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. Anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. Aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. The organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes. No statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 50 patients with chronic otitis media; pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Only aerobes were isolated from 21 patients (42%), three patients had only anaerobes (Peptococcus sp), and 25 patients (50%) had both aerobes and anaerobes. Only one specimen had no growth. There were 68 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 36 patients (72%); other aerobes commonly recovered included Proteus sp and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 48 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 24 instances (21 Peptococcus sp and three Peptostreptococcus sp). Sixteen Bacteroides sp were recovered, including seven B fragilis group and six B melaninogenicus.
TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis caused by anaerobic bacteria: report of two cases.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen in acute suppurative parotitis. Although anaerobic bacteria are prevalent in the normal oral and upper respiratory tract flora and frequently are involved in oral and facial infections, they have seldom been isolated from patients with suppurative parotitis. It may be that a role for anaerobes in parotitis has not been documented because of inadequate specimen transport or anaerobic culture techniques. We describe two cases of acute suppurative parotitis in which cultures yielded anaerobic bacteria. In one case, no aerobes were isolated; in the other, the anaerobe was the predominant organism numerically.
TI  - Bacteriology of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Sixteen patients with necrotizing fasciitis were observed under clinical and laboratory conditions for collection, preservation, and culture that permitted optimal retrieval of anaerobes. The clinical observations of necrosis of fascia, subcutaneous fat and skin with thrombosis of the microvasculature, and absence of myonecrosis were clearly apparent in these patients. Two clear-cut groups of culture and gram stain results were found, suggesting that the clinical entity of necrotizing fasciitis can occur after infection by different infecting organisms. The cultivation of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), either alone or in combination with staphylococcus, in three patients conforms to the culture results found by Meleney [1] in his original description.
TI  - Susceptibilities of bacteria against chemotherapeutics under different conditions.
AB  
TI  - In vitro inhibition of growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae by genital microorganisms.
AB  - The ability of microorganisms present in titers of over 10(5)/ml in the vaginal or cervical secretions to inhibit growth of N. gonorrhoeae in vitro was tested. Study of a strain of N. gonorrhoeae against 77 microorganisms demonstrated that most strans of S. epidermidis, S. aureus and the one "Gaffkya anaerobia" interfered with the growth of the N. gonorrhoeae. A minority of strains of S. viridans, Neisseria, Candida and Bifidobacterium demonstrated interference. No strains of enterococcus, diptheroids, aerobic Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, anaerobic Lactobacillus or Veillonella demonstrated interference.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Bacteriology of normal and infected conjunctiva.
AB  - The conjunctivas of 273 inflamed eyes were cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Isolations were obtained from 267 (97.8%) of the eyes. Aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86.8%) of the conjunctivas. Staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23.1%) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63.0%) of the conjunctivas. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46.2%) of the conjunctivas, and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29.3%) of the conjunctivas. Comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. When anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating that they may be missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
