TI  == cephalosporinases associated with outer membrane vesicles released by bacteroides spp. protect gut pathogens and commensals against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: to identify beta-lactamase genes in gut commensal bacteroides species and to assess the impact of these enzymes, when carried by outer membrane vesicles (omvs), in protecting enteric pathogens and commensals. methods: a deletion mutant of the putative class a beta-lactamase gene (locus tag bt_4507) found in the genome of the human commensal bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was constructed and a phenotypic analysis performed. a phylogenetic tree was built from an alignment of nine bacteroides cephalosporinase protein sequences, using the maximum likelihood method. the rate of cefotaxime degradation after incubation with omvs produced by different bacteroides species was quantified using a disc susceptibility test. the resistance of salmonella typhimurium and bifidobacterium breve to cefotaxime in liquid culture in the presence of b. thetaiotaomicron omvs was evaluated by measuring bacterial growth. results: the b. thetaiotaomicron bt_4507 gene encodes a beta-lactamase related to the cepa cephalosporinase of bacteroides fragilis. omvs produced by b. thetaiotaomicron and several other bacteroides species, except bacteroides ovatus, carried surface-associated beta-lactamases that could degrade cefotaxime. beta-lactamase-harbouring omvs from b. thetaiotaomicron protected salmonella typhimurium and b. breve from an otherwise lethal dose of cefotaxime. conclusions: the production of membrane vesicles carrying surface-associated beta-lactamases by bacteroides species, which constitute a major part of the human colonic microbiota, may protect commensal bacteria and enteric pathogens, such as salmonella typhimurium, against beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == interactions between bifidobacterium and bacteroides species in cofermentations are affected by carbon sources, including exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacteria.
AB  == cocultures of strains from two bifidobacterium and two bacteroides species were performed with exopolysaccharides (eps) previously purified from bifidobacteria,  with inulin, or with glucose as the carbon source. bifidobacterium longum nb667 and bifidobacterium breve ipla20004 grew in glucose but showed poor or no growth  in complex carbohydrates (inulin, eps e44, and eps r1), whereas bacteroides grew  well in the four carbon sources tested. in the presence of glucose, the growth of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron dsm-2079 was inhibited by b. breve, whereas it remained unaffected in the presence of b. longum. ba. fragilis dsm-2151 contributed to a greater survival of b. longum, promoting changes in the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and organic acids in coculture with respect to monocultures. in complex carbohydrates, cocultures of bifidobacterium  strains with ba. thetaiotaomicron did not modify the behavior of bacteroides nor  improve the poor growth of bifidobacteria. the metabolic activity of ba. fragilis in coculture with bifidobacteria was not affected by eps, but greater survival of bifidobacteria at late stages of incubation occurred in cocultures than in monocultures, leading to a higher production of acetic acid than in monocultures. therefore, cocultures of bifidobacterium and bacteroides can behave differently against fermentable carbohydrates as a function of the specific characteristics of the strains from each species. these results stress the importance of considering specific species and strain interactions and not simply higher taxonomic divisions in the relationship among intestinal microbial populations and their different responses to probiotics and prebiotics.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == influence of milk-feeding type and genetic risk of developing coeliac disease on  intestinal microbiota of infants: the proficel study.
AB  == interactions between environmental factors and predisposing genes could be involved in the development of coeliac disease (cd). this study has assessed whether milk-feeding type and hla-genotype influence the intestinal microbiota composition of infants with a family history of cd. the study included 164 healthy newborns, with at least one first-degree relative with cd, classified according to their hla-dq genotype by pcr-ssp dqb1 and dqa1 typing. faecal microbiota was analysed by quantitative pcr at 7 days, and at 1 and 4 months of age. significant interactions between milk-feeding type and hla-dq genotype on bacterial numbers were not detected by applying a linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measures. in the whole population, breast-feeding promoted colonization  of c. leptum group, b. longum and b. breve, while formula-feeding promoted that of bacteroides fragilis group, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, e. coli and b. lactis. moreover, increased numbers of b. fragilis group and staphylococcus spp., and reduced numbers of bifidobacterium spp. and b. longum were detected in infants with increased genetic risk of developing cd. analyses within subgroups of either breast-fed or formula-fed infants indicated that in both cases increased risk of cd was associated with lower numbers of b. longum and/or bifidobacterium spp. in addition, in breast-fed infants the increased genetic risk of developing cd was associated with increased c. leptum group numbers, while in formula-fed infants it was associated with increased staphylococcus and  b. fragilis group numbers. overall, milk-feeding type in conjunction with hla-dq  genotype play a role in establishing infants' gut microbiota; moreover, breast-feeding reduced the genotype-related differences in microbiota composition, which could partly explain the protective role attributed to breast  milk in this disorder.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == [intestinal bacterial colonisation and translocation in c3h/hej conventional mice fed a unique dose of live or dead bifidobacterium breve c50].
AB  == the efficiency and safety of use of bifidobacterium breve c50 (bbc50), a potential probiotic, was assessed as regards intestinal microbial colonisation and bacterial translocation. a suspension of bbc50, containing 1-5 to 107-108 live bacteria, was fed to c3h/hej mice. the passage of live bbc50 was not demonstrated by culture either in the intestine or extra-intestinal organs. however, mice receiving the highest dose of live bacteria harbored more lactobacilli and less bacteroides fragilis group in the cecum and colon when compared to control mice. translocation of lactobacilli observed in the control group was not regulated by bb50 feeding. indeed, the spleen was significantly more frequently contaminated in mice fed bbc50, whatever the dose of live bacteria. the kidneys were also significantly more contaminated with lactobacilli in mice fed the highest dose of live bb50. moreover, higher dose of live bbc50 was associated with greater number of extra-intestinal contaminated organs. to conclude, bbc50 feeding induced a favorable balance in the mouse intestinal flora and was never found translocating, demonstrating its efficiency and safety of use. however, bbc50 seemed to interfere with the ability of lymphoid organs (e.g. the spleen) to eliminate translocating lactobacilli.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == cell-free wheys from bifidobacteria fermented milks exert a regulatory effect on  the intestinal microflora of mice and humans.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and clostridia are normally present in the human colon but they may exert pathogenic effects when the homeostasis is upset following various forms of stress. one approach to preventing gastrointestinal disorders is to use  bifidobacteria fermented milk. it has been suggested that the efficacy of such a  product is related to abiotic compounds produced during milk fermentation. experiments reported in this paper attempt to check this theory. six whey retentates were prepared by fermenting cow's milk with six human strains of bifidobacterium breve and acetic and lactic acids were eliminated by ultrafiltration. their ability to reduce intestinal clostridial carriage was assessed in c3h mice. only one whey retentate led to a decrease in clostridia, bacilli, b. fragilis and fecal ph and to an increase in bifidobacteria. assays in ten human volunteers resulted in similar changes in fecal flora and fecal ph within 7 days of whey retentate intake (30 ml/day). no antibiotic-like effect was demonstrated in vitro. compounds involved in microflora regulation were located in two ultrafiltrated fractions (30-100 and 100-300 kda). both fractions contained mainly low molecular weight glycoproteins (20-40 kda) and two high molecular weight glycoproteins (121, 211 kda) that were almost undetectable in the inactive 10-30 kda fraction.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == [influence of s-1108 on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the effect of s-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and pediatric patients. s-1108 in a fine granular form was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. the viable fecal bacterial cell count of each of these 4 species of bacteria was slightly reduced in 5 days after the start of  the drug administration. five boys (weighing 12.0 to 42.0 kg) with bacterial infections were entered into this pediatric study. their ages ranged from 2 years 4 months to 9 years 3 months. s-1108 (fine granules) was administered at a dose of 2.3 to 6.0 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 5 to 11 days. cell counts of primary aerobes, anaerobes and total anaerobic cells decreased markedly in three patients, but in the remaining two patients the total number of aerobic and anaerobic cells did not change appreciably. glucose-nonfermentating gram-negative rods did not become predominant during the period of s-1108 administration. candida became predominant in the three patients in whom the other bacteria had markedly decreased. counts of predominant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased markedly during the regimen in 3 out of 5 cases. s-1006 was detected in stools of the 3 cases at concentrations ranging from 235 to 516 micrograms/g during the administration of s-1108. intestinal bacteria that produce beta-lactamase were not present in the feces of any of the patients. based on these results, s-1108 (fine granules) appears to have relatively little effect on intestinal bacterial flora similarly to other new oral cephems. because of individual differences, however, the drug may be excreted in the feces at high concentrations, and this would result in changes in intestinal bacterial flora. therefore, attention must be given to fecal drug concentrations.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained  are summarized as follows: 1. a total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sbt/abpc against various bacterial species. sbt/abpc showed stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms than against gram-negative rods. 2. the peak serum level  of abpc was about twice as high as that of sbt, and serum levels of abpc and sbt  declined with time. both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. the half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for abpc and 70-73%  for sbt. 4. the effect of sbt/abpc on coagulation system was examined. no case showed changes in pt, aptt, tt and hpt before and after administration of sbt/abpc. platelet aggregation during administration of sbt/abpc was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that sbt/abpc had no effect on platelet aggregation. generally speaking, it seemed that sbt/abpc was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. the effect of sbt/abpc on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of sbt/abpc, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of sbt/abpc more greatly than by the administration of abpc alone. in a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of  the intestinal bacterial flora. thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. no diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. from the above results, it appeared that sbt/abpc was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.

AB  == effects of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules, a new oral beta-lactam antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated  mice and in pediatric patients. sbtpc was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. in all of the 4 species, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced on days 4 to 5 after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 1 year 3 months to 10 years 8 months and with their body weight ranging from 11.8 kg to 35.0 kg. sbtpc fine granule was administered at a  dose of 10 mg/kg 3 to 4 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although there were some variations in the fecal bacterial flora noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae,  enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium decreased markedly in all cases. these decreases were more pronounced for anaerobes and total numbers of anaerobes were markedly reduced in all cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase with administration of sbtpc fine granule. although these changes tended to return to pre-dosing state after the cessation of the treatment with sbtpc fine granule, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is  continued for a long period of time. fecal concentrations of both ampicillin and  sulbactam during sbtpc fine granule treatment showed relatively high values except 1 sample with a high beta-lactamase activity in feces. these high concentrations suggest the possibility of biliary excretion of absorbed drugs and the possibility of hydrolysis of sbtpc in the intestine due to high ph. fecal concentrations of the drug also appeared to be closely related to beta-lactamase  activity in feces.

TI  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). the bifidobacterium spp. most frequently  isolated from the three groups of infants were b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum. the bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were  b. fragilis and b. vulgatus. the most common clostridium sp. in the three groups  of infants was c. perfringens. the type of milk did not select for species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, or clostridium, except for clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. the species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.

TI  == [influence of cefroxadine dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == influence of cefroxadine (cxd) dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in mice infected with 4 species of bacteria, namely, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve, and in pediatric patients having infections in the respiratory tract and cutaneous/soft  tissues. the results were summarized as follows: cxd dry syrup was administered for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with the 4 species. no considerable changes were observed in levels of bacteria in the feces and in different parts of digestive tracts. eleven pediatric patients were orally administered with 30-54 mg/kg of cxd dry syrup a day for 7-15 consecutive days. symptom of diarrhea was noted in 2 patients. dominant species of the intestinal flora such as e. coli, bifidobacterium, and bacteroides sometimes decreased in patients treated with cxd dry syrup. in general, however, decreases in numbers of these bacteria were insignificant. changes of intestinal flora in patients treated with cxd dry  syrup were apparently smaller than those treated with ampicillin and were similar to those treated with cephalexin or amoxicillin.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: fecal flora of infants with vitamin k deficiency.
AB  == the fecal flora of 10 infants with vitamin k deficiency (vkd) and 10 healthy infants was examined. all the infants were breast-fed. in the infants with vkd, the total counts (p less than 0.01) and the numbers of bifidobacteria (p less than 0.001) were lower than in the healthy infants, whereas bacteroides, veillonella and enterococci were present in greater numbers in the feces of infants with vkd. the incidence of the bacteroides fragilis group was higher (p less than 0.05) in the infants with vkd than in the healthy infants. a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in bifidobacterium breve was shown in the infants with vkd. the data emphasize the abnormal flora in infants with vkd.
