TI  == bisphosphonates enhance bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on bone hydroxyapatite.
AB  == background: because of the suspicion that bisphosphonates enhance bacterial colonization, this study evaluated adhesion and biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans 25175, staphylococcus aureus 6538, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 14454 reference strains on hydroxyapatite coated with clodronate, pamidronate, or zoledronate. material and methods: bacterial strains were cultured on bisphosphonate-coated and noncoated hydroxyapatite discs. after incubation, nonadhered bacteria were removed by centrifugation. biofilm formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial colonization was estimated using quantitative cultures compared by means with kruskal-wallis and post-hoc student-newman-keuls tests. modeling of the interactions between bisphosphonates and hydroxyapatite was performed using the density functional theory method. results: bacterial colonization of the hydroxyapatite discs was significantly higher for all tested strains in the presence of bisphosphonates vs. controls: adherence in the presence of pamidronate was higher than with other bisphosphonates. density functional theory analysis showed that the protonated amine group of pamidronate, which are not present in clodronate or zoledronate, forms two additional hydrogen bonds with hydroxyapatite. moreover, the reactive cationic amino group of pamidronate may attract bacteria by direct electrostatic  interaction. conclusion: increased bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation can promote osteomyelitis, cause failure of dental implants or bisphosphonate-coated  joint prostheses, and complicate bone surgery in patients on bisphosphonates.

TI  == antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  == context: preparations from artocarpus heterophyllus lam. (moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. objective: the objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from a. heterophyllus heartwoods. materials and methods: the dried and powdered a. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. each of the extracts was screened for their  antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. the extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and  discussion: the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes, and bacillus subtilis with  mic values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/ml, respectively. based on an antibacterial  assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis with mics of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8,  8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, and mbcs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria with mic and mbc values of 12.9 and 25.8 microm, respectively. only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with an mic of 286.4 microm.

TI  == the pseudomonas quinolone signal inhibits biofilm development of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == bacteria often thrive in natural environments through a sessile mode of growth, known as the biofilm. biofilms are well-structured communities and their formation is tightly regulated. however, the mechanisms by which interspecies interactions alter the formation of biofilms have not yet been elucidated in detail. we herein demonstrated that a quorum-sensing signal in pseudomonas aeruginosa (the pseudomonas quinolone signal; pqs) inhibited biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans. although the pqs did not affect cell growth, biofilm formation was markedly inhibited. our results revealed a unique role for this multifunctional pqs and also indicated its application in the development of prophylactic agents against caries-causing s. mutans.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so  little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == recent advances in natural product-based anti-biofilm approaches to control infections.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are highly organized surface-associated communities of bacteria encased within an extracellular matrix produced by themselves, capable of growing in connection with different biological or inert surfaces such as artificial joints or catheters. biofilms are commonly associated with many health problems, such as endocarditis, otitis media, periodontitis, prostatitis, and urinary tract infections. several bacteria, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, or fungal pathogen as candida albicans, can form biofilms in the body tissues, leading to different infections. the inherently defensive character of the biofilm is demonstrated by enhanced persistence of bacteria grown in the sessile  mode respect to bacteria grown planktonically. this makes most biofilm- associated infections difficult to eradicate, thus contributing to disease chronicity. since natural products provide a diverse array of chemical structures and possess a wide variety of biological properties, natural resources are worldwide exploited in the search of new pharmaceuticals. in this context bioactive secondary metabolites from natural sources, useful for the new antimicrobial and anti-biofilm drugs, are of interest. in this review, the role of small molecules from plants and marine organisms in inhibiting and/or dispersing bacterial biofilms is discussed, as well as the approaches that have been applied to the discovery of lead small molecules that mediate biofilm development. molecules inhibiting the formation of biofilm may have therapeutic potential. several candidates, as halogenated furanones, 2-amminoimidazole alkaloids and flavonoids have been already isolated and characterized from many plants and from marine organisms.

TI  == microbial biofilms are able to destroy hydroxyapatite in the absence of host immunity in vitro.
AB  == purpose: it is widely thought that inflammation and osteoclastogenesis result in  hydroxyapatite (ha) resorption and sequestrum formation during osseous infections, and microbial biofilm pathogens induce the inflammatory destruction of ha. we hypothesized that biofilms associated with infectious bone disease can  directly resorb ha in the absence of host inflammation or osteoclastogenesis. therefore we developed an in vitro model to test this hypothesis. materials and methods: customized ha discs were manufactured as a substrate for growing clinically relevant biofilm pathogens. single-species biofilms of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans and mixed-species biofilms of c albicans plus s mutans were incubated on ha discs for 72 hours to grow mature biofilms. three different non-biofilm control groups also were established for testing. ha discs were then evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography metrotomography, x-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy with planimetric analysis. in addition, quantitative cultures and ph assessment were performed. analysis of variance was  used to test for significance between treatment and control groups. results: all  investigated biofilms were able to cause significant (p < .05) and morphologically characteristic alterations in ha structure as compared with controls. the highest number of alterations observed was caused by mixed biofilms of c albicans plus s mutans. s mutans biofilm incubated in medium with additional sucrose content was the most detrimental to ha surfaces among single-species biofilms. conclusions: our findings suggest that direct microbial resorption of bone is possible in addition to immune-mediated destruction, which has important  translational implications for the pathogenesis of chronic bone infections and for targeted antimicrobial therapeutics.

TI  == development of a novel resin with antimicrobial properties for dental application.
AB  == the adhesion of biofilm on dental prostheses is a prerequisite for the occurrence of oral diseases. objective: to assess the antimicrobial activity and the mechanical properties of an acrylic resin embedded with nanostructured silver vanadate (beta-agvo3). material and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of beta-agvo3 was studied in relation to the species staphylococcus aureus  atcc 25923, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and candida albicans atcc 10231. the halo zone of inhibition method was performed in triplicate to determine the inhibitory effect of the modified self-curing acrylic resin dencor lay-classico. the surface hardness and compressive strength  were examined. the specimens were prepared according to the percentage of beta-agvo3 (0%-control, 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%), with a sample size of 9x2 mm for surface hardness and antimicrobial activity tests, and 8x4 mm for the compression test. the values of the microbiologic analysis were compared and evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test (alpha=0.05); the mechanical analysis used the shapiro-wilk's tests, levene's test, anova (one-way), and tukey's test (alpha=0.05). results: the addition of 10% beta-agvo3 promoted antimicrobial activity against all strains. the antimicrobial effect was observed at a minimum  concentration of 1% for p. aeruginosa, 2.5% for s. aureus, 5% for c. albicans, and 10% for s. mutans. surface hardness and compressive strength increased significantly with the addition of 0.5% beta-agvo3 (p<0.05). higher rates of the  nanomaterial did not alter the mechanical properties of the resin in comparison with the control group (p>0.05). conclusions: the incorporation of beta-agvo3 has the potential to promote antimicrobial activity in the acrylic resin. at reduced  rates, it improves the mechanical properties, and, at higher rates, it does not promote changes in the control.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (clf1), a triterpene isolated from combretum leprosum mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of gram positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and s. mitis. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable  bacteria. in addition, the acute toxicity of clf1 on artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. the results showed that clf1 was able in inhibiting the growth of s.  mutans and s. mitis with mic and mbc of 7.8 mug/ml and 15.6 mug/ml, respectively. clf1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. only 7.8 mug/ml clf1 was  enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of s. mutans and s. mitis, respectively. on the other hand, such effects were not evident on gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. the toxicity tests showed that the lc50 of clf1 was 98.19 mug/ml. therefore, clf1 isolated from c. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == a microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  == background: the objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmf-t), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. method: included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. the children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental  treatments during this trial. the distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. after performing a survey for the education, occupation,  and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. the children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine)  for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of  each week. the 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. results: the decrease in the dmf-t index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeuroginosa, enterococcus spp, staphylococcus epidermidis and candida albicans. except for candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. in the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. conclusion: the findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == antibacterial effect of iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

TI  == photosensitization of in vitro biofilms formed on denture base resin.
AB  == statement of problem: proper sterilization or disinfection of removable prostheses and surgical guides has been problematic in dental practice because of the absence of simple and low-cost techniques that do not cause damage to acrylic resins. purpose: the purpose of this study was to study the effect of photodynamic therapy against streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. material and methods: the specimens were sterilized in ethylene oxide gas and submitted to in vitro biofilm growth. the photodynamic therapy consisted of the application of 0.05% methylene blue (p+) conjugated to irradiation with a light-emitting-diode of 630 nm and 150 mw (l+). the specimens  were randomly divided into groups (n=5): negative control (p-l-); stained and irradiated at 10 j/cm(2) (p+l+ 10); stained and irradiated at 30 j/cm(2) (p+l+ 30); stained and not irradiated (p+l-); not stained and irradiated at 10 j/cm(2)  (p-l+ 10); not stained and irradiated at 30 j/cm(2) (p-l+ 30); and gold standard  (gs), sterilized. afterward, the specimens were submitted to contact with culture medium agar for 10 minutes in petri plates, which were incubated for 48 hours at  37 degrees c. the number of colony-forming units was obtained, and the data were  expressed according to scores (1=0; 2=1-10; 3=11-100; 4=101-1000) and analyzed by the friedman and dunn tests (alpha=.05). results: streptococcus mutans was sensitized by (p+l-); p aeruginosa and c albicans were also sensitized by the dye but showed a slight microbial reduction with (p+l+ 30), as did s aureus (p>.05);  e coli presented an initial score of 3 and achieved a bacterial reduction to score 2 with (p+l+ 30) (p=.039). conclusions: photodynamic therapy was effective  in reducing e coli counts on biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. the inhibition of microorganism growth tended to be directly proportional to the amount of energy provided by the light-emitting diode.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == a distinguishable role of edna in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  == bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (epss). the extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular dna (edna). here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. a maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). principal-component  analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. the fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. an intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other epss, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact edna, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of eps constituents. this implies that edna modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. importance: the protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical  stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (epss) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic  relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other epss control a second, slower relaxation. extracellular dna, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other epss.

TI  == microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  == the present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. the product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). these molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). the structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened  for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and three gram-negative bacteria viz., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, fusarium oxysporum, penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against dalton's ascitic lymphoma (dal) cell line. in general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. the coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (r = i-pr, r(1) = 6-cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against dalton's ascitic lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/ml.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == silver nanoparticles as active ingredient used for alcohol-free mouthwash.
AB  == we developed an effective and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and has a low concentration of silver nanoparticles (snp) in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised oncologic patients. we studied antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (snp) in the range of (50-0.024 microg/ml) and 3% of ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) in mouthwash. antimicrobial effects of two treatments were studied by doing challenge test on microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and measuring mic and mbc (mfc) values of snp toward mentioned microorganisms. these values of snp respectively were in the range of (0.78-3.12) and (1.56-12.5 microg/ml). results showed that snp in the mic and the lower concentrations killed all of the used microorganisms. no difference was observed between the antimicrobial effect of ethanol-free mouthwash containing snp and mouthwash containing snp and ethanol (30,000 microg/ml). snp has high antimicrobial effects at low concentrations and  it can be a good alternative for ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) because ethanol is also irritating, especially to sensitive or inflamed mucosa.

TI  == comparison of chlorine dioxide and dichloroisocyanurate disinfectants for use in  the dental setting.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial properties of a slow  release noncorrosive chlorine dioxide with those of sodium dichloroisocyanurate to establish their possible use in the dental settings. materials and methods: disinfectant solutions were prepared according to manufacturers' instructions and tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, streptococcus mutans nctc 1044, candida albicans atcc 90028, bacillus subtilis atcc 15244 spores, mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc 25177, mycobacterium  avium subsp. avium atcc 25291 and hepatitis b virus using the standard quantitative suspension test. the shelf-lives of the disinfectants were also determined. results: both disinfectants killed all the test organisms within 30 seconds. b. subtilis spores were killed in 2 and 2.5 minutes by chlorine dioxide  and sodium dichloroisocya nurate respectively. when diluted solutions of these disinfectants were stored in screw cap bottles, they retained their activity for  at least 30 days. conclusions: chlorine dioxide and sodium dichloroisocyanurate containing disinfectants can be used in the denta settings for surfaces and heat  sensitive instruments. however, chlorine dioxide is advantageous because it is non-corrosive and the effective concentration is lower than that recommended for  sodium dichloroisocyanurate.

TI  == rapid, electrical impedance detection of bacterial pathogens using immobilized antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the detection of bacterial pathogens plays an important role in many biomedical applications, including clinical diagnostics, food and water safety, and biosecurity. most current bacterial detection technologies, however, are unsuitable for use in resource-limited settings where the highest disease burdens often exist. thus, there is an urgent need to develop portable, user-friendly biosensors capable of rapid detection of multiple pathogens in situ. we report a  microfluidic chip for multiplexed detection of bacterial cells that uses antimicrobial peptides (amps) with species-specific targeting and binding capabilities. the amps are immobilized onto an electrical impedance microsensor array and serve as biorecognition elements for bacterial cell detection. characterization of peptide immobilization on the sensors revealed robust surface binding via cysteine-gold interactions and vertical alignment relative to the sensor surface. samples containing streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were loaded in the chip, and both microorganisms were detected at minimum concentrations of 10(5) cfu/ml within 25 min. measurements performed in a variety of solutions revealed that high-conductivity solutions produced the largest impedance values. by integrating a highly specific bacterial cell capture scheme with rapid electrical detection, this device demonstrates great potential  as a next-generation, point-of-care diagnostic platform for the detection of disease-causing pathogenic agents.

AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

AB  == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various  oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects  consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an  improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and  oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not  only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

AB  == (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg), a main constituent of tea catechins, affects gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria differently; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. atomic force microscopy (afm) was used to compare morphological alterations in gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria induced by egcg and by h(2)o(2) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). egcg initially induced aggregates in the cell envelopes of staphylococcus aureus and eventually caused cell lysis, which was not observed in cells treated  with h(2)o(2). it initially induced nanoscale perforations or microscale grooves  in the cell envelopes of escherichia coli o157:h7 which eventually disappeared, similar to e. coli cells treated with h(2)o(2). an e. coli o157:h7 tpx mutant, with a defect in thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (tpx), was more severely  damaged by egcg when compared with its wild type. similar differing effects were  observed in other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria when exposed to egcg;  it caused aggregated in streptococcus mutans, while it caused grooves in pseudomonas aeruginosa. afm results suggest that the major morphological changes  of gram-negative bacterial cell walls induced by egcg depend on h(2)o(2) release. this is not the case for gram-positive bacteria. oxidative stress in gram-negative bacteria induced by egcg was confirmed by flow cytometry.

AB  == biofilm is a common bacterial lifestyle, and it plays a crucial role in human health, causing biofilm-mediated infections. recently, to counteract biofilm development, new nano-structured biomaterials have been proposed. however, data about the antibacterial properties of nano-structured surfaces are fragmentary and controversial, and, in particular, the susceptibility of nano-structured materials to colonization and biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens has not been yet thoroughly considered. here, the ability of the pathogenic streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa to adhere and form biofilm on surfaces coated with single-wall carbon nanotubes (swcnts) was analyzed. our results showed that  the surfaces of swcnts-coated glass beads (swcnts-gbs) were colonized at the same extent of uncoated gbs both by s. mutans and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, our results demonstrate that single wall swcnts-coated surfaces are not suitable to counteract bacterial adhesion and biofilm development.

TI  == influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == hyaluronic acid (ha) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for ha, we investigated its effects on 15 atcc strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. the in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. the results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by ha. in particular, staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus mutans, two escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose-dependent growth inhibition; no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans; s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose. therefore, the influence of ha on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.

TI  == assessment of the antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine paste and other intracanal medications against bacterial pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of four formulations of calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)(2)] pastes against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus mutans. methods: a broth dilution test was performed, and the lengths of time for different pastes to kill the microbial cells were recorded and statistically analyzed. the following medications were assessed: group i - ca(oh)(2) + 2.0% chlorhexidine (chx) gel; group ii - ca(oh)(2) + camphorated paramonochlorophenol (cmcp) and propylene glycol; group iii - ca(oh)(2) + propylene glycol; group iv - ca(oh)(2) + saline. results: the results showed that e. faecalis was the most resistant microorganism. groups ii and iii eliminated all the microbial cells in 15 seconds. group i took 45 seconds to eliminate e. faecalis. conclusions: under the conditions of this study, it was concluded that  all the intracanal medications tested showed antibacterial activity. however, the association of ca(oh)(2) and pmcc or ca(oh)(2) and propylene glycol showed a better performance, since groups ii and iii took a shorter length of time than the other groups to eliminate s. aureus and e. faecalis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == proposal of protocols using d-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2h-tetrazolium hydroxide (xtt) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

AB  == the present study examined the bactericidal effects of orexin b (orxb) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) alone or combined with cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as ll-37, on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus. the bactericidal effect of orxb or vip alone was detected in low nacl concentration, but attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150 mm). however, such attenuated bactericidal  activities of orxb and vip in 150 mm nacl were regained by adding ll-37. therefore, our results indicate that vip and orxb appear to mediate bactericidal  effects in concert with ll-37 in the physiological context of mucosal tissue.

TI  == effects of deuterium oxide on streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a complex aggregation of microorganisms growing on a solid substrate is termed a  biofilm and is considered to be an etiological agents. pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus mutans are representative bacteria in such biofilms. it is well known that deuterium oxide (d(2)o) causes toxic effects on a number of biological systems. we investigated the effects of d(2)o on growth and biofilm formation of  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans. these bacteria were incubated in medium containing d(2)o (100%, 75% or 0%) at 37 degrees c for 24hr, 48 hr or 72 hr. growth of p. aeruginosa was inhibited by d(2)o within the first 48 hr. however, after 72 hr, growth rate was seen to increase in the d(2)o-containing medium compared with in  medium without d(2)o. in contrast, the growth of s. mutans in the d(2)o medium was inhibited within 72 hr. the biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa was increased  in the d(2)o medium. biofilm formation of s. mutans in the d(2)o medium increased compared with in the medium without d(2)o, but this increase was only temporary in the case of p. aeruginosa. compared to biofilm formation in 0% d(2)o medium marked as 100%, the biofilm formation rate of s. mutans in 75% d(2)o medium was 143% at 24 hr, 146% at 48 hr and 130% at 72 hr. in other d(2)o concentration media biofilm formation was lower. in 100% d(2)o medium, biofilm formation rate decreased from 114% at 24 hr to 56% at 72 hr. the biofilm formation rate of p. aeruginosa in 100% d(2)o medium was 172% at 24 hr, but decreased to 88% at 72 hr. biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa in 75% and 0% d(2)o media showed no significant difference. we consider that these results were due to stress or alteration in bacterial metabolisms.

TI  == light insensitive silver(i) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  == ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject  of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus  aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm  formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.

TI  == comparative effect of chlorhexidine and some mouthrinses on bacterial biofilm formation on titanium surface.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and commonly used mouthrinses to single- and poly-species biofilms by s. mutans, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, on titanium discs of grade iv. the formation of single- and poly-species biofilms at 16.5, 40.5 and 64.5-h incubation on titanium surface was evaluated by plate count (cfu ml(-)(1)) before and after exposure to chx and four mouthrinses (curasept, listerine, meridol and  buccagel) and expressed as percentage of inhibitory activity (ia%). the application of the different anti-plaque formulations on biofilm can reduce the adhesion of bacteria to titanium surface with different degrees. the higher efficacy was observed for listerine that shows ia% = 100 on the biofilm formed by s. mutans at 16.5 h. log count of cfu was dependent to culture time and four mouthrinses for s. mutans and s. aureus, whilst was not dependent to culture time but to mouthrinses for p. aeruginosa. in general, the efficacy was particularly lesser to poly-species biofilms; no statistical differences were evidenced between all the mouthrinses and chx as control group. the tested mouthrinses, compared to reference chx 0.2%, have demonstrated a significant lower antibacterial activity than listerine towards the experimental biofilms. this "in vitro" biofilm model should prove extremely useful for pre-clinical testing of anti-plaque agents, which inhibit biofilm formation, can prevent subsequent implant failure.

TI  == 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose and its derivatives: biosynthesis, preparation and potential medical applications.
AB  == 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose (af) was first found in fungi and red algae. it is produced by the degradation of glycogen, starch and maltosaccharides with alpha-1,4-glucan lyase (ec 4.2.2.13). in vivo, af is metabolized to 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (ag), ascopyrone p (app), microthecin and other derivatives via the anhydrofructose pathway. the genes coding for the enzymes in  this pathway have been cloned, enabling the large-scale production of af and related products in a cell-free reactor. the possible applications of these products in medicine have been evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo systems. thus af is a useful anticariogenic agent as it inhibits the growth of the oral pathogen streptococcus mutans, impairing the production of plaque-forming polysaccharides and lactic acid. af also shows anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. ag is used as a diabetic marker for glycemic control. ag also stimulates insulin secretion in insulinoma cell lines. in vivo, app has been shown to lengthen the life span of cancer-afflicted mice. it interferes with tumor growth  and metastasis by its cidal effects on fast multiplying cells. microthecin inhibits the growth of the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, particularly under anaerobic conditions. the pharmaceutical usefulness of the other af metabolites 1,5-anhydro-d-mannitol,1-deoxymannojirimycin, haliclonol, 5-epipentenomycin i, bissetone, palythazine, isopalythazine, and clavulazine remains to be investigated. in this review af and its metabolites as the bioactive natural products for their pharmaceutical potentials are discussed.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

AB  == effects of food additives on biofilm formation by food-borne pathogenic bacteria  were investigated. thirty-three potential food additives and 3 related compounds  were added to the culture medium at concentrations from 0.001 to 0.1% (w/w), followed by inoculation and cultivation of five biofilm-forming bacterial strains for the evaluation of biofilm formation. among the tested food additives, 21 showed inhibitory effects of biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and in particular, sugar fatty acid esters showed significant anti-biofilm activity. sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (c14-16) exerted their inhibitory effect at the concentration of 0.001%  (w/w), but bacterial growth was not affected at this low concentration. activities of the sugar fatty acid esters positively correlated with the increase of the chain length of the fatty acid residues. sugar fatty acid esters inhibited the initial attachment of the s. aureus cells to the abiotic surface. sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (c14-16) also inhibited biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans and listeria monocytogenes at 0.01% (w/w), while the inhibition of biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa required the  addition of a far higher concentration (0.1% (w/w)) of the sugar fatty acid esters.

AB  == problem: irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impressions are dimensionally unstable and difficult to disinfect. purpose: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorite disinfectant (presept) and a new formulation chlorine dioxide based disinfectant (aseptrol) on irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impression material. materials and methods: alginate blocks were contaminated with candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans and bacillus subtilis spores. the blocks were placed either  in sterile distilled water as control, or in 48-ppm aseptrol or presept solution  containing organic matter. immersion times were 30 seconds, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 5 minutes. the blocks were then placed in sterile 0.5% sodium thiosulphate neutralizer and surviving organisms were harvested and counted using the serial dilution technique followed by culturing on appropriate media. the anti-microbial efficacy of the solution was tested for 37 days. results: there was a consistent  significant reduction (99.99%) in all tests of vegetative organisms after immersion in the aseptrol for 30 seconds, and for spores after 1.5 minutes. it was effective against vegetative organisms for up to 27 days for a 30-second exposure. presept significantly reduced (99.99%) c. albicans, s. aureus and s. mutans in 30 seconds, p. aeruginosa in 60 seconds, but for b. subtilis spores took at least 5 minutes. it was effective against vegetative organisms for >37 days for a 30-second exposure. conclusion: within the limits of this study it was found that both compounds effectively disinfected the alginate in the presence of organic material, but that aseptrol did so after an immersion time of only 1.5 minutes. this immersion time is less likely to affect the dimensional properties  of the impression material. clinical implications: the short action time of aseptrol may make it ideal for the disinfection of alginate impressions, and it may also find many uses for disinfection and possible sterilisation.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == tuning the surface-enhanced raman scattering effect to different molecular groups by switching the silver colloid solution ph.
AB  == silver colloids were produced for surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) experiments using hydroxylamine hydrochloride as the reduction agent. the roles of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and bulk solution ph values in the formation of functional groups on the surface of silver colloids and in determining the dimensions of silver colloids were examined using raman, fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) and ultraviolet-visible (uv-vis) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (afm), and zeta-size measurements. the spectrum of hydroxylamine hydrochloride reduced silver colloids was compared with the spectrum of sodium borohydride reduced colloids. the effect of colloid solution ph on sers results was demonstrated using analyte molecules with biological significance, such as ribonucleic acid, egg albumin, l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, and glucose. in general, it was shown that at high ph values the sers effect was more pronounced  due to the surface functional groups and colloid dimensions, and sharp, high spectral intensity values were obtained. at low ph values, protonation and rapid  aggregation of colloids occurred and the surface chemistry was different. depending on the analyte, bands were shifted, broadened, and/or the enhancement effect was reduced. using pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and streptococcus mutans it was also shown that by changing the solution bulk ph value, it was possible to enhance the response from different molecular groups in the bacteria and obtain different spectra from the same bacteria strain and the process was reversible. it was concluded that it is possible to produce site- or molecule-specific metal  colloids and to tune the sers effect to certain functional groups of analytes by  means of the ph of colloidal suspension.

AB  == numerous reports have indicated the important role of human normal flora in the prevention of microbial pathogenesis and disease. evidence suggests that infections at mucosal surfaces result from the outgrowth of subpopulations or clusters within a microbial community and are not linked to one pathogenic organism alone. to preserve the protective normal flora whilst treating the majority of infective bacteria in the community, a tuneable therapeutic is necessary that can discriminate between benign bystanders and multiple pathogenic organisms. here we describe the proof-of-principle for such a multitargeted antimicrobial: a multiple-headed specifically targeted antimicrobial peptide (mh-stamp). the completed mh-stamp, m8(kh)-20, displays specific activity against targeted organisms in vitro (pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus mutans) and can remove both species from a mixed planktonic culture with little impact against untargeted bacteria. these results demonstrate that a functional, dual-targeted molecule can be constructed from a wide-spectrum antimicrobial peptide precursor.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  == many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. this study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance p (sp), neurokinin a (nka), calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), neuropeptide y (npy) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip), displayed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. sp, npy, vip and cgrp displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of  s. aureus. these antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.

TI  == distribution of bacteria and fungi in the earthworm libyodrillus violaceous (annelida: oligochaeta), a native earthworm from nigeria.
AB  == earthworms are soil invertebrates that play a key role in recycling organic matter in soils. in nigeria, earthworms include libyodrillus violaceous. aerobic  and anaerobic bacterial counts, as well as fungal counts of viable microorganisms in soils and gut sections, were made on twenty l. violaceous collected from different sites on the campus of the university of agriculture, abeokuta, nigeria. the samples were collected between april and november, 2002. numbers of  microorganisms were higher in castings and gut sections than in un-ingested soil  samples. the guts and their contents also had higher moisture and total nitrogen  contents than the un-ingested soils. bacteria and fungi isolated from the samples were identified by standard microbiological procedures on the bases of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. isolated bacteria were identified  as staphylococcus, bacillus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, clostridium, spirocheata spp., azotobacter spp., micrococcus lylae, acinetobacter spp., halobacterium for bacteria. yeast isolates were identified as candida spp., zygosaccharomyces spp., pichia spp., and saccharomyces spp while molds were identified as, aspergillus spp., pytium spp., penicillium spp., fusarium spp and  rhizopus spp. of the five locations examined, the refuse dump area had the highest numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, followed by the arboretum while the cultivated land area recorded the lowest counts. the higher numbers of microorganisms observed in the gut sections and casts of the earthworms examined in this work reinforce the general concept that the gut and casts of earthworms show higher microbial diversity and activity than the surrounding soil.

TI  == an analysis of the persistent presence of opportunistic pathogens on patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts.
AB  == purpose: this study aimed to assess the persistent presence of microorganisms on  patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts, while highlighting important human pathogens such as candida, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and pseudomonas aeruginosa. materials and methods: the practices and opinions regarding cross-infection control from 59 general dentists in japan were obtained via a questionnaire. alginate impressions were made from 56 patients. using a brain heart infusion agar medium, impression and imprint cultures were carried out to visualize the microbial contamination on the surfaces of the impressions and gypsum casts, respectively. the colonies on the surfaces of the 30 impression cultures and 26 imprint cultures were collected by swabbing and then inoculated onto selective agar plates to detect streptococci, staphylococci, candida, mrsa, and p aeruginosa. results: the questionnaire showed that only 54%  of general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics, and only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of mrsa or p aeruginosa on impressions and gypsum casts. the impression/imprint cultures grew a large number of visible bacterial colonies on all of impression/gypsum cast samples investigated. selective agar cultures demonstrated the presence of streptococci (100, 100%), staphylococci (56.7, 65.4%), candida (30, 46.2%), mrsa (26.7, 15.4%), and p aeruginosa (6.7, 7.7%) on the impressions and the gypsum casts, respectively. conclusions: this investigation showed that patient-derived dental  impressions and gypsum casts are contaminated with numerous microbes, including candida, mrsa, and p aeruginosa, which are known pathogens responsible for nosocomial and/or life-threatening infection in the immunocompromised host.

TI  == reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive rgd modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  == ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. poly(l-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (pll-g-peg) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. pll-g-peg can be functionalized with bioligands such as rgd (arg-gly-asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized pll-g-peg and rgd-peptide functionalized pll-g-peg reduced the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to titanium (ti) surfaces. the present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. the different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and fluorescence light microscopy (fm). the adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on ti surfaces coated with pll-g-peg compared to uncoated ti surfaces even in the presence of rgd. the percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. therefore, coating surfaces with pll-g-peg/peg-rgd allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of uncaria tomentosa against oral human pathogens.
AB  == uncaria tomentosa is considered a medicinal plant used over centuries by the peruvian population as an alternative treatment for several diseases. many microorganisms usually inhabit the human oral cavity and under certain conditions can become etiologic agents of diseases. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of uncaria tomentosa on different strains of microorganisms isolated from the human oral cavity. micropulverized uncaria tomentosa was tested in vitro to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) on selected microbial strains. the tested  strains were oral clinical isolates of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus spp., candida albicans, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the tested concentrations of uncaria tomentosa ranged from 0.25-5% in mueller-hinton agar. three percent uncaria tomentosa inhibited 8% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 52%  of s. mutans and 96% of staphylococcus spp. the tested concentrations did not present inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. it could be concluded that micropulverized uncaria tomentosa presented antimicrobial activity on enterobacteriaceae, s. mutans and staphylococcus spp. isolates.

TI  == an alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  == the ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. the colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. in this article, we propose an alternative method based on fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples.  the method is based on a systematic treatment of ftir spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. it is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). in parallel, the amide ii band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the c-h stretching  region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide ii or c-h stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. this method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and dna. results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in  biofilms can be identified. the proposed ftir approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  == infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml  sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.

TI  == glycoprotein 340 in normal human ocular surface tissues and tear film.
AB  == the tear film is a complex mixture of secreted fluid, ions, proteins, glycoproteins, and lipids that lubricates and protects the ocular surface. recently, several antimicrobial peptides have been described in the tear fluid. in this study, we describe the presence of the large secreted glycoprotein gp340  in the tear film. western blot analysis showed that gp340 is abundant in secreted tears and in the lacrimal glands. lesser amounts of gp340 were detected in the cornea and conjunctiva. consistent with western blot data, reverse transcription-pcr and real-time quantitative pcr showed that gp340 transcripts were abundant in lacrimal gland tissue and were also present in the cornea and conjunctiva. immunohistochemistry localized gp340 to the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland and the deeper layers of the conjunctival epithelium. gp340 was not detected in conjunctival goblet cells. in the cornea, gp340 was present only  in a peripheral band of basal epithelial cells, suggesting that gp340 may play a  role in the cycle of corneal epithelial renewal. to determine if tear film gp340  may function as a bacterial agglutinin as it does in saliva, tears were incubated with streptococcal cells and the formation of bacterial aggregates was monitored. addition of tears to late-exponential-phase streptococcus mutans cells resulted in time- and dose-dependent aggregation of the bacteria. furthermore, western blot analysis confirmed the presence of cell-associated gp340 in isolated bacterial aggregates. the ocular pathogen staphylococcus aureus, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa, also aggregated when incubated with tears. these results  suggest that gp340 is a normal component of the tear film and that the glycoprotein may function as a bacterial agglutinin.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == lactoferrin functions: current status and perspectives.
AB  == lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein synthesized by neutrophils and exocrine glands, plays an important role in human innate defense mechanisms against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. first, a bacteriostatic activity of lactoferrin, depending on iron withholding to bacteria, and successively a bactericidal iron-independent effect, related to its binding on bacterial surfaces, was recognized. many other functions have been ascribed to this cationic protein, including the inhibiting action toward bacterial adhesion and invasion of target  host cells. recent research also reported the lactoferrin influence on bacterial  aggregation and biofilm development of pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus mutans. the different lactoferrin functions can be justified by different physicochemical properties of the molecule, which include the iron-binding capability, the binding to anionic cell surfaces and molecules, and serine protease activity.

TI  == [isolation, purification and antibacterial activities of salivary histidine-rich  polypeptides].
AB  == objective: to isolate and purify salivary histidine-rich-polypeptides (hrps) and  observe their antibacterial activities. methods: by using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (au-page), three major hrps(hrp-1, hrp-3  and hrp-5) were purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. their antibacterial activities were tested in the ultrasensitive antibacterial assay, named radial diffusion assay. results: each fraction of the three purified hrps appeared as a single protein zone both in au-page and tricine-sds-page. their molecular weights are 3-5 kd as determined by tricine-sds-page. all the three major hrps showed potent bactericidal effects on streptococcus mutans mt6r and staphylococcus aureas atcc25923. as to escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853, hrp-3 and hrp-5 also demonstrated significant antibacterial activities, whereas hrp-1 did not show any inhibitory effects on the viability of them. conclusion: the above results suggested that the method of preparative au-page we used in this study has the benefits of high resolution, simple manipulation and perfect results of purification. hrps are important components to prevent oral tissue from bacterial infections, therefore play a potent role in the maintenance of the oral health.

TI  == ccl28 has dual roles in mucosal immunity as a chemokine with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ccl28 is a cc chemokine signaling via ccr10 and ccr3 that is selectively expressed in certain mucosal tissues such as exocrine glands, trachea, and colon. notably, these tissues commonly secrete low-salt fluids. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that salivary glands expressed ccl28 mrna at the highest levels among various mouse tissues. single cells prepared from mouse parotid glands indeed contained a major fraction of cd3(-)b220(low) cells that expressed ccr10 at high levels and ccr3 at low levels and responded to ccl28 in chemotaxis assays. morphologically, these cells are typical plasma cells. by immunohistochemistry, acinar epithelial cells in human and mouse salivary glands  were strongly positive for ccl28. furthermore, human saliva and milk were found to contain ccl28 at high concentrations. moreover, the c terminus of human ccl28  has a significant sequence similarity to histatin-5, a histidine-rich candidacidal peptide in human saliva. subsequently, we demonstrated that human and mouse ccl28 had a potent antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria, and gram-positive bacteria. the c-terminal 28-aa peptide  of human ccl28 also displayed a selective candidacidal activity. in contrast, ccl27, which is most similar to ccl28 and shares ccr10, showed no such potent antimicrobial activity. like most other antimicrobial peptides, ccl28 exerted its antimicrobial activity in low-salt conditions and rapidly induced membrane permeability in target microbes. collectively, ccl28 may play dual roles in mucosal immunity as a chemoattractant for cells expressing ccr10 and/or ccr3 such as plasma cells and also as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial protein secreted into  low-salt body fluids.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to titanium-oxy-nitride (tinox) coatings with different resistivities: a novel approach for the development of biomaterials.
AB  == in this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different tinox coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an  air-liquid interface. s. epidermidis and s. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest  adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. p. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. these results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for tinox coatings with a specific resistivity. tinox coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of s. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. however, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated tinox remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. this indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the tinox coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% naocl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast candida albicans. activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. the base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of muller hinton medium or 10.0 ml of brain heart infusion agar in a petri dish. after solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of muller hinton medium or brain heart infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. absorbent paper disks (6.0  mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the candle jar system was used  for the brain heart infusion agar plates. all tests were performed in duplicate.  after incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% naocl was effective only against s. aureus.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of a novel u.v. beaker, powered in a domestic microwave oven. methods and results: three beakers were compared, with most rapid killing obtained in the neutra plasma 50. ultraviolet light generated  within the beakers efficiently killed planktonic and surface-associated streptococcus mutans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vegetative bacillus stearothermophilus, herpes simplex and polio viruses. candida albicans and mycobacterium phleii were less rapidly killed, and only 70% inactivation of b. stearothermophilus endospores was achieved. irradiation for 45 s reduced viable bacterial counts in saliva by > 99%. conclusions: the u.v.-generating beakers efficiently reduced viable counts of bacteria, yeast and viruses. kinetics of killing varied, reflecting the fact that lethal mechanisms are complex, and probably depend on interplay between u.v. and heat. significance and impact of the study: this novel method of generating u.v., using a cheap and widely available power source, provides a rapid, inexpensive and non-toxic method of disinfection with a wide range of applications in hospitals, clinics and the home.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

AB  == pretreatment of mice with subimmunogenic doses of meningococcal polysaccharide (mp), pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (pa), or streptococcus mutans polysaccharide (sm) resulted in suppression of antibody response. the transfer of putative suppressor t cells (ts cells) from donor mice primed with a subimmunogenic dose of mp to naive recipients at the time of immunization with mp substantially reduced the magnitude of the antibody response. also, the infusion  of b cells taken from animals immunized with either mp or pa suppressed the antibody response of naive recipients to mp or pa, respectively, relative to controls, suggesting that ts cells respond to determinants on immune b cells. we  observed that the injection of concanavalin a or phytohemagglutinin (two lectins  known to augment the activity of amplifier t cells [ta cells]) 2 days postimmunization enhanced the antibody response to mp and sm. in addition, ta-cell activity was transferred to naive animals by using spleen cells. although the administration of phytohemagglutinin at the time of immunization with mp also resulted in increased antibody response, the injection of concanavalin a simultaneous with immunization resulted in a suppression of the antibody response to mp. although ts cells generated in response to pneumococcal polysaccharide type iii were found to respond to monoclonal antibody ly-m22, ta cells responded  to monoclonal antibodies l3t4 and ia but not to ly-m22. these studies suggest that ta and ts cells can modulate the antibody response to mp, sm, and pa in a positive and negative manner, respectively.

TI  == bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. previous studies have shown that, when this protein  is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on streptococcus mutans and vibrio cholerae. the present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. the list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. s. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. when a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture  became lactoferrin resistant. since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (s. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. it appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.
