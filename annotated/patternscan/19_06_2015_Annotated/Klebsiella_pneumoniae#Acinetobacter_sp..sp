TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of phyto fabricated silver nanoparticles using mukia scabrella (musumusukkai) against drug resistance nosocomial gram negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  == given the fact in the limitation of the therapeutic options for emerging multidrug resistance gram-negative bacteria (mdr-gnb) of respiratory tract infections, the present study was focused on green synthesis of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (agnps) using leaf extract of mukia scabrella. an obvious color change to brown color and surface plasmon resonance by uv-visible spectroscopy (uv-vis) indicated a well observable peak at 440 nm confirming the synthesis of agnps. fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ftir) analysis indicates protein as possible capping agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy results showed major signal for elemental silver. x-ray diffraction  (xrd) analysis indicates the formation of metallic silver nanomaterials. transmission electron microscopic (tem) study showed the nanoparticles in the size range of 18-21 nm with spherical shape. zeta potential analysis showed -21.7 mv characteristic for stable agnps. the biosynthesized agnps exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against mdr-gnb nosocomial pathogens of acinetobacter sp., klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results from the current study suggested that m. scabrella material could be exploited for the fabrication of agnps with potential therapeutic applications in nanomedicine especially for nosocomial bacterial infections.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == [chromagar kpc. comparison with the method proposed by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc, usa) for rectal screening and evaluation of false positive results].
AB  == eighty one rectal swabs (rs) were cultured on chromagar kpc and the cdc method. of the 81 samples, 9 were positive for kpc-producing klebsiella pneumoniae on chromagar kpc, and 6 for the cdc method. chromagar kpc had two false positive (fp) results: 1 k. pneumoniae and 1 acinetobacter sp. fp results on the cdc method were: 25 acinetobacter spp., 2 escherichia coli and 4 k. pneumoniae: chromagar kpc yielded a better recovery of kpc-producing bacteria and less fp results than cdc method. in order to evaluate fp results on chromagar kpc, 1247 rs were cultured and yielded 1021 negatives, 171 kpc-producing k. pneumoniae and  55 fp (4.4 %). because of the fp results growing on chromagar kpc, kpc must be phenotypically confirmed in the bacteria isolated.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == objectives: urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. the incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly  and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which  makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. this study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. methods: a six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from august 2009 to january 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using microsoft(r) excel 2002 software. results: the study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. in terms of pathogenic distribution, escherichia coli was the highest followed by streptococcus sp., acinetobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. though meropenem showed no resistance with  e. coli, acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with e. coli, whereas no resistance with acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with streptococcus sp. gentamicin exhibited no resistance with acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance  with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus sp. respectively. hence, nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with  e. coli and streptococcus sp. nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with  acinetobacter and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). cephalosporins  (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. conclusion: pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.

TI  == microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  == background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline  susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.

TI  == carbapenem stewardship: positive impact on hospital ecology.
AB  == introduction: excessive group 2 carbapenem use may result in decreased bacterial  susceptibility. objective: we evaluated the impact of a carbapenem stewardship program, restricting imipenem and meropenem use. methods: ertapenem was mandated  for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae infections in the absence of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (gnb) from april 2006 to march 2008. group 2 carbapenems were restricted for use against gnb infections susceptible only to carbapenems and suspected gnb infections in unstable patients. cumulative susceptibility tests were done for nosocomial pathogens before and after restriction using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guide-lines.vitek system or conventional identification methods were performed and susceptibility testing done by disk diffusion according to clsi.antibiotic consumption (t-test) and susceptibilities (mcnemar's test) were determined. results: the defined daily doses (ddd) of group 2 carbapenems declined from 61.1 to 48.7 ddd/1,000 patient-days two years after ertapenem introduction (p = 0.027). mean ertapenem consumption after restriction was 31.5 ddd/1,000 patient-days. following ertapenem introduction no significant susceptibility changes were noticed among gram-positive cocci. the most prevalent gnb were p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter spp. there was no change in p. aeruginosa susceptibility to carbapenems. significantly improved p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin susceptibilities were observed, perhaps due to decreased group 2 carbapenem use. k. pneumoniae susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole improved. conclusion: preferential use of ertapenem resulted in reduced group 2 carbapenem use, with a positive impact on p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae susceptibility.

TI  == role of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == eighty per cent of the cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd) have an infective aetiology, atypical bacteria including mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for 5-10 % of these. however, the importance of association of m. pneumoniae with episodes of aecopd still remains  doubtful. the present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of m. pneumoniae in patients with aecopd at a referral hospital in delhi, india. sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 aecopd patients attending the clinical research center of vallabhbhai patel chest institute, delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (january 2004-june 2006). the samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and m.  pneumoniae. diagnosis of infection with m. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen and pcr. bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, streptococcus pneumoniae from four and klebsiella spp. from two cases. acinetobacter sp. and moraxella catarrhalis were  isolated from one case each. serological evidence of m. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of m. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. one case with definite evidence of m. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with pseudomonas spp. however, no direct evidence of m. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or pcr. in conclusion, although the serological prevalence of m. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in aecopd.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == characterization of the microbial flora in disinfecting footbaths with hypochlorite.
AB  == change or disinfection of footwear are measures to prevent cross contamination between areas with low and high hygienic levels in the food industry. the efficacy of disinfecting footwear is not well documented. samples of used disinfectant and from swabbing of corners after draining were taken from disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine in four norwegian cheese factories. bacteria were present in 9 of 12 footbaths and more positive samples were found from swab samples than from used disinfectant. the microbial flora in footbaths varied between the dairies. in two dairies, the flora was dominated by pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp., respectively. in the third dairy, both bacillus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were present and in the fourth dairy, the flora was diverse (acinetobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus sp.). the strains were not resistant to the recommended  user concentration of chlorine in bactericidal suspension or surface tests. the degree of attachment to plastic varied between strains and species and bacteria attached to surfaces were in general more resistant than suspended bacteria. the  results of the survey indicated that disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia: importance of recognition of aetiological agents to define  an appropriate initial empirical therapy.
AB  == of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from january 1995 to october 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). about 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). the site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. staphylococcus aureus (34%) was  the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but  not for late onset pneumonia. based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was  the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of two fourth-generation cephalosporins against bacterial samples isolated from patients in several brazilian hospitals.
AB  == cefpirome and cefepime are two fourth-generation cephalosporins recently introduced in brazil. they have a very similar range of in vitro antimicrobial activity, but some differences have been noticed. the goal of this study was to compare the in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime against bacterial samples isolated in brazilian hospitals. we studied 931 samples taken from hospitalized patients between april and june, 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the etest method. the potency of cefpirome was similar to that  of cefepime, except against enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, where cefpirome proved 2-fold more potent. the mic(90) for cefepime were inferior to cefpirome in response to klebsiella pneumoniae (mic(90), 24 and 96microg/ml, respectively), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 48 and 128microg/ml, respectively), and other gram-negative organisms (mic(90), 64 and 256microg/ml, respectively). despite the fact that cefpirome presented a slightly broader range of action against gram-positive bacteria (90% sensitive vs. 78% sensitive to cefepime), and that cefepime presented an equally broad range against gram-negative bacteria (74% sensitive vs. 65% sensitive to cefpirome), these differences were not considered clinically significant because the sensitivity differed in mic by less than 2 dilutions. only 16 (1.7%) of the 931 samples tested showed a significant difference in sensitivity. this study suggests that,  except for acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa, laboratories may routinely test only cefpirome and apply the same category result to cefepime. since category discrepancies are very rare and cefpirome is slightly less active than cefepime against enterobacteriaceae, isolates susceptible to cefepime will certanly also be susceptible to cefpirome. to optimize the treatment of severely infected patients, especially where species such as acinetobacter sp and p. aeruginosa are involved, we recommend that both cephalosporins be tested by using the same susceptibility test method to determine the mic.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of piperacillin/tazobactam in comparison with other broad-spectrum beta-lactams.
AB  == combining tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, with the ureidopenicillin, piperacillin, successfully restores the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. thus, piperacillin/tazobactam is highly active against most clinically important species of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. we evaluated the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates from a tertiary university hospital located in sao paulo, brazil. its activity was compared to that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, aztreonam, and imipenem against 820 isolates (608 gram-negative and 212 gram-positive) collected from hospitalized patients in 1999. the most frequent species tested were pseudomonas aeruginosa (168/20%), escherichia coli (139/17%), acinetobacter spp. (131/16%), and staphylococcus aureus (76/9%). of the isolates studied, 30% were from the bloodstream, 16% from  the lower respiratory tract, and 11% from surgical wounds or soft tissue. the isolates were susceptibility tested by the broth microdilution method according to nccls procedures. the isolates tested were highly resistant to most antimicrobial agents evaluated. imipenem resistance was not verified among enterobacteriaceae, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active beta-lactams against this group of bacteria (80.0% susceptibility). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was very high among e. coli (approximately 20%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (approximately 40%). imipenem was uniformly active against these species (100% susceptibility) and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active compound inhibiting 84.4% of isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly resistant to all beta-lactams evaluated and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active compound against this species. our results demonstrate an extremely high level of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital evaluated, especially among non-enteric gram-negative  bacilli. due to this high level of resistance, piperacillin/tazobactam represents an important contribution to the treatment of nosocomial infections.

TI  == neonatal gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  == a 22 months prospective study of neonatal gram-negative bacteremia was undertaken in a 15 bed nicu to find out the incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns. clinically suspected 1326 cases of neonatal sepsis were studied during this period. more than 25% of the cases were microbiologically positive for sepsis. among 230 (67.2%) cases of gram-negative bacteremia, the predominant isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (38.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), escherichia coli (15.6%) and acinetobacter sp. (7.8%). fifty-nine per cent of the neonates were born in hospital while 41% were from community and referral cases. lower respiratory tract infection, umbilical sepsis, central intravenous line infection and infection following invasive procedures were the most commonly identified sources of septicemia. prematurity and low birth weight were the main underlying  conditions in 60% of the neonates. total mortality was 32%. increased mortality was mainly associated with neutropenia, nosocomial infection and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. resistance was increasingly noted against many antibiotics. the isolates were predominantly resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins (25%-75%), piperacillin (68%-78%), and gentamicin (23%-69%). the commonest microorganisms causing gram-negative bacteremia were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by klebsiella pneumoniae. the community-acquired bacteremia was mainly due to e. coli. the proportion of preterm and low birth weight babies was significantly high, and the major contributing factor in total mortality. sensitivity to different antibiotics conclusively proved that a combination of ampicillin + sulbactam with amikacin or ampicillin + sulbactam with ciprofloxacin is most effective.

TI  == [treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. design and patients: a prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34  with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. the efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. results: the mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. the most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) e. coli; 2 (3.23%) acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. the  most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) s. aureus; 2 (5.88%) p. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) k. pneumoniae. clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). conclusion: our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.

AB  == background: the new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position c3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. it is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. we investigated the efficiency of the  cefepime (maxipime, bms) against acinetobacter sp., x. maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., flavobacterium sp., sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) (enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp.). methods and results: we determined the susceptibility of the 54  strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. the majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and mic is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have mic = 6.25 mg/l. two strains (one strain p. aeruginosa a one strain k. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and mic = 12.5 mg/l. the activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of p. cepacia and two strains of sphingobacterium multivorum. they  hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. conclusions: at the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. however, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

AB  == newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. there is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but  available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, enterobacter sp, and acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. at this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. thus, combination  therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.

AB  == a nitrilase was purified, apparently to homogeneity, from a cell extract of acinetobacter sp. ak 226, which converts racemic 2-(4'-isobutylphenyl)propionitrile (ibu-cn) to s-(+)-2-(4'-isobutyl-phenyl)propionic acid (s-(+)-ibuprofen). the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated as 580,000 upon gel filtration. the nitrilase hydrolyzed many kinds of nitrile compounds such as aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic mononitriles or dinitriles. the amino-terminal amino acids were  sequenced and found to be partly homologous to a nitrilase from klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozanae. the purified enzyme had a ph optimum of 8.0 and a temperature optimum of 50 degrees c. the enzyme was not affected by chelating reagents, carbonyl reagents, reductants, most metal ions, or thiol reagents except silver ion, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and phenylmercuribenzoate. the reaction with racemic ibu-cn resulted in the preferential production of s-(+)-ibuprofen, demonstrating that the nitrilase is highly enantioselective to s-(-)-ibu-cn. in fact, the enzyme showed a 180-fold higher activity for racemic ibu-cn than that for r-(+)-ibu-cn.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and  some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

TI  == bacterial growth rates and competition affect nodulation and root colonization by rhizobium meliloti.
AB  == the addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. a  bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by r. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by r. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by r. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. bradyrhizobium sp. and "sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by r. meliloti. the doubling times in the rhizosphere for e. aerogenes, p. marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and k. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for bradyrhizobium sp. and "s. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of r. meliloti. under the same conditions, arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. we suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
