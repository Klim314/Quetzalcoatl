TI  == alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism by cytochrome-containing anaerobes.
AB  == during growth in the presence of tracer amounts of exogenously supplied alpha-keto[1-14c]glutarate (akg) or alpha-keto [5-14c]glutarate, cytochrome-containing bacteroides fragilis strain 2044 and bacteroides vulgatus strain 8482 incorporated extremely small amounts of radioactivity into cell macromolecules and protoheme. under identical conditions, bacteroides "l" strain  7cm and bacteroides buccae strain j1 incorporated substantial label from [5-14c]akg, but not [1-14c]akg, into cellular macromolecules and protoheme. bacteroides succinogenes strain s85 incorporated radioactivity from both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into cell macromolecules, but only label from [5-14c]akg appeared in protoheme. selenomonas ruminantium strain hd1 and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain d1, both of which are devoid of cytochromes, incorporated substantial label from both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into cell macromolecules, but failed to incorporate label from either position into protoheme. bacteroides ruminicola sp. brevis strain ga33 incorporated label from  both [1-14c]akg and [5-14c]akg into both cell macromolecules and protoheme. a substantial portion of the heme synthesized by this organism may be formed by the "plant" pathway involving the intact use of the akg carbon skeleton. major differences exist in the manner and extent of akg utilization among cytochrome-containing anaerobes and between these organisms and bacteria devoid of cytochromes obtained from similar environments.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
