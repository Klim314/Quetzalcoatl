TI  == influence of in-situ synthesized exopolysaccharides on the quality of gluten-free sorghum sourdough bread.
AB  == the majority of gluten-free breads on the market are of poor sensory and textural quality. exopolysaccharides (eps) formed from sucrose during sourdough fermentation can improve the technological properties of gluten-free breads and potentially replace hydrocolloids. in this study, the influence of in situ formed eps on dough rheology and quality of gluten-free sorghum bread was investigated.  dextran forming weissella cibaria mg1 was compared to reuteran producing lactobacillus reuteri vip and fructan forming l. reuteri y2. eps containing bread batters were prepared by adding 10% and 20% of sourdough. as control served batters and bread containing sourdoughs fermented without sucrose and batters and bread without sourdough addition. the amount of eps formed in situ ranged from 0.6 to 8.0 g/kg sourdough. eps formed during sourdough fermentation were responsible for the significant decrease in dough strength and elasticity, with in situ formed dextran exhibiting the strongest impact. increased release of glucose and fructose from sucrose during fermentation enhanced co(2) production of yeast. organic acids in control sourdough breads induced hardening of the bread crumb. eps formed during sourdough fermentation masked the effect of the organic acids and led to a softer crumb in the fresh and stored sorghum bread. among eps, dextran showed the best shelf life improvements. in addition to eps, all three strains produced oligosaccharides during sorghum sourdough fermentation contributing to the nutritional benefits of gluten-free sorghum bread. results of this study demonstrated that eps formed during sourdough fermentation can be successfully applied in gluten-free sorghum flours to improve their bread-making  potentials.

TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == exopolysaccharide synthesized by lactobacillus reuteri decreases the ability of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to bind to porcine erythrocytes.
AB  == this study investigated the therapeutic potential of bacterial polysaccharides by employing a model system based on enteroxigenic escherichia coli (etec)-induced hemagglutination of erythrocytes. exopolysaccharides produced by strains of lactobacillus reuteri inhibited etec-induced hemagglutination of porcine erythrocytes. no effect was observed for dextran produced from weissella cibaria  and commercially available oligo- and polysaccharides.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from indonesia reveals glucansucrase and fructansucrase genes in two different weissella confusa strains from soya.
AB  == homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been well studied in the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus and lactobacillus. this study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (gtf) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (ftf) enzymes from genomic dna of 'rare' indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing lab. from a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing lab isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. by comparing bacterial growth on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs)-sucrose with that on mrs-raffinose, and using the results of a previous pcr screening study with degenerate primer pairs  targeting the conserved catalytic domain of gtfs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of  both glucan and fructan (nine). here, we report the characteristics of three gtf  genes and one ftf gene obtained from weissella confusa strains mbf8-1 and mbf8-2. strain mbf8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfb of lactobacillus reuteri 121 and gtf180 of l. reuteri 180, respectively. strain mbf8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to gtfkg3 of lactobacillus fermentum kg3 and dsrwc of weissella cibaria, and ftf levansucrase of l. reuteri 121, respectively.

TI  == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers  for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one  lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.
