rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the icu.
activity of eravacycline against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from new york city.
eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 gram-negative pathogens from new york city hospitals, with mic50/mic90 values, respectively, for escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing kpc and oxa carbapenemases. for a. baumannii, eravacycline mics correlated with increased expression of the adeb gene.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.
in vitro activities of antimicrobials against six important species of gram-negative bacteria isolated from raw milk samples in korea.
gram-negative bacteria (gnb) with multidrug resistance pose a serious threat to public health. they are environmental pathogens frequently isolated from raw milk and mastitis in dairy cattle. this study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activities against 225 isolates belonging to six important species of gnb from mastitic raw milk samples of dairy herds in the republic of korea: acinetobacter baumannii (n = 17), citrobacter freundii (n = 19), enterobacter cloacae (n = 54), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 55), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 45), and serratia marcescens (n = 35). in general, amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against all bacterial species tested, whereas rifampin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin were ineffective against most of the bacterial species tested. wide differences were observed in the patterns of resistance among the bacterial species; in particular, resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was highly variable among the strains belonging to different bacterial species. almost half of the gnb isolates (45.3%, 102/225) were resistant to 5 or more of 12 antimicrobial agents tested: p. aeruginosa (86.6%, 39/45) showed the highest resistance rate, followed by s. marcescens (65.7%, 23/35). this study indicates that multiple antimicrobial resistances are prevalent among gnb isolates from mastitic milk samples of dairy cattle in the republic of korea.
update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.
in vitro activities of beta-lactam antibiotics alone and in combination with sulbactam against gram-negative bacteria.
the resistance rates of ampicillin/sulbactam 2:1 against imipenem-susceptible and -resistant acinetobacter baumannii were 23.5 and 30%, respectively. ceftazidime/sulbactam combination showed significant reduction of resistant rates against enterobacter cloacae, a. baumannii, esbl klebsiella pneumoniae. mic90 of cefoperazone against e. cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii and esbl k. pneumoniae were > 128 mg/l. addition of sulbactam enhanced the antimicrobial activities significantly. when imipenem was combined with sulbactam, the resistant rates against imipenem-resistant a. baumanni were significantly reduced. cefepime/sulbactam combination was active against imipenem-resistant a. baumanni. the resistance rates of aztreonam/sulbactam combination against e. cloacae, imipenem-sensitive and resistant a. baumannii, esbl k. pneumoniae were lowered significantly. the cefotaxime/sulbactam combination showed a significant improvement of activities against e. cloacae, s. marcescens, a. baumannii and esbl k. pneumoniae.
synergistic activities of moxifloxacin combined with piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.
the bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime  or piperacillin-tazobactam against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated by using time-kill methods and antimicrobial concentrations of one-half and one times the mic. synergy was observed in 58 to 88% of the strains and resulted in bactericidal activity against 60 to 100% of the strains. combinations including moxifloxacin demonstrated enhanced bactericidal activity compared with that of either agent tested alone.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: trust and tsn data for the united states. tracking resistance in the united states today. the surveillance network.
from january to may 2000, as part of the tracking resistance in the united states today (trust) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the united states. isolates were tested for susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. in addition, data for the same period were collected from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the us. both surveillance methods produced similar results. against isolates of enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by trust and tsn surveillance. trust identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. isolates of p. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). other results from trust included pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, trust; 87.4% susceptible, tsn) against acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against stenotrophomonas maltophilia. s. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). against 513 urinary isolates of escherichia coli in trust, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. trust and tsn data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. trust centralized in vitro and electronic (tsn) surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
