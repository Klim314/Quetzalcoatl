TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.
AB  == what is known and objective: probiotic therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in premature infants in several  international studies using various probiotic agents. the purpose of this study(*) is to describe our experience of using probiotic therapy in preventing nec in infants with very low birth weight (vlbw) in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and to evaluate whether our records provide evidence of effectiveness for probiotic therapy. methods: in a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of  probiotic therapy in preventing nec in vlbw infants was investigated via chart review. a probiotic administration protocol using a three-strain (streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum) supplement was implemented in august 2007. patients admitted to the nicu from august 2003 through july 2011 were screened. primary outcomes are the morbidity and mortality of nec. the secondary outcomes were severity of nec and incidence of where infant feeds were stopped but nec was not diagnosed (nec scare). results and discussion: there was a significant increased baseline risk of nec development in the probiotics group, including younger gestational age, higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) and use of indomethacin. the incidence of nec is similar  between the control group (2.8%) and probiotics group (2.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.42, 3.12). mortality of nec is also not statistically different. incidence of nec scare was decreased from 2.8% in control group to 1.4% in probiotics group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.38). what is known and conclusion: our findings  suggest that probiotics are safe in nec prevention in vlbw infants. we had no cases of infection related to the strains of bacteria used in our product. with the low incidence of nec (2.8%) and nec scare (2.8%) in our cohort, we do not have enough power to detect any change in outcome, particularly as our study was  observational. however, it is hoped that our data give useful information for others on probiotic prophylactic therapy in the routine clinical management of vlbw infants.

TI  == effect of bifidobacterium bifidum bf-1 on gastric protection and mucin production in an acute gastric injury rat model.
AB  == homeostasis in the stomach environment is maintained by the balance of protective factors such as gastric mucus and aggressive factors such as gastric acid, stress, alcohol, and drugs. an overload of aggressive factors that upsets this balance can induce gastric injury. fermented milk that contains bifidobacterium bifidum bf-1 (bf-1), a probiotic strain, and streptococcus thermophilus yit 2021  (st) is known to improve helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis in humans. here, we investigated the gastroprotective potential of bf-1 in a rat model of acid-ethanol-induced acute gastric injury to fully elucidate its potential compared with st. living bf-1, st, or vehicle was orally administrated to rats, and acid-ethanol gastric injury was induced 2h later. the gastric injury rate was determined and shown to be significantly lower in the bf-1 group than in the vehicle group, which showed a similar level to the st group. the production of gastric mucin and the expression of several target genes associated with protection and inflammation were examined before and after induction of gastric injury. interestingly, mucin 5ac (muc5ac) gene expression in gastric corpus samples and gastric mucin production in stomach samples from the bf-1 group, but  not the st group, were significantly higher than those in the respective samples  from the vehicle group. these findings indicate that bf-1 has the potential to provide gastroprotection, alleviating acute gastric injury by enhancing the production of gastric mucin in a rat model.

TI  == [the influence of probiotic fermented milk product on colon microbiota, hematological parameters and cell immunity in rats].
AB  == influence of probiotic fermented milk product on the intestinal microbiota, hematological parameters and immune status of the experiment in vivo at wistar rats was studied. it was shown, that entering of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium longum b-379m and lactobacillus acidophilus nk1 u streptococcus thermophilus in composition fermented milk products in the total quantity of 2,1 x 10(7) cfu/ sm3 in digestive tract within  three weeks has a positive influence on the resident of colon microbiota. significant increasing of population levels of bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae with normal biochemical properties, registered a strong tendency to increase the content of lactobacteria, which led to a decreasing the  number of potential pathogenic transient flora with pathogenic factors. monitoring of body mass in experimental animals has shown that including of fermented milk product with probiotic strains in diet has a positive influence on the feed uptake. probiotic properties of the product also have stimulated effect  on the immune status of the rat: improvements in cell immunity (increasing the relative amount of t-helper cells, immuneregulatory index) and hematological parameters (increase

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == use of gases to improve survival of bifidobacterium bifidum by modifying redox potential in fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the effect of the oxidoreduction potential, modified using gas, on the growth and survival of a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium bifidum, and 2 yogurt strains, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. three fermented milks were manufactured with an initial oxidoreduction potential value adjusted to +440 mv (control milk), +350 mv (milk gassed with n(2)), and -300 mv [milk gassed with n(2) plus 4% (vol/vol) h(2) (n(2)-h(2))]. acidification profiles, growth during milk fermentation and survival during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 d were determined. this study showed that fermented probiotic dairy products made from milk gassed with n(2) and, more particularly, those made from milk gassed with n(2)h(2) were characterized by a significant increase in b. bifidum survival during storage without affecting the fermentation kinetics and the survival of strep. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.

TI  == modelling the survival of starter lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium bifidum in single and simultaneous cultures.
AB  == the inactivation kinetics at 4 degrees c of bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, cultured alone or consociated in a laboratory medium (modified mrs broth), were modelled through the weibull model and a second-order polynomial equation. the initial cell number of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was approximately 6-7log (cfu/ml); the viability loss after 30 days of storage was 2.87 and 1.99log (cfu/l) for l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, cultured alone, respectively; whereas the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with bifidobacteria reduced viability loss during storage (0.28 and  0.54log cfu/l for lactobacilli and streptococci, respectively). finally, the consociation of lactobacilli and streptococci with b. bifidum improved their oxygen uptake.

TI  == use of probiotics in hiv-infected children: a randomized double-blind controlled  study.
AB  == hiv/aids is an infection characterized by immune cell dysfunction and subsequent  immunodeficiency, as well as intestinal disorder. probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that beneficially affect the host animal by improving intestinal microbial balance and promoting health benefits. the goals of this study were to  determine whether the use of probiotics could improve the immune response determined by cd4 cells mm(-3) counts and reduce liquid stool episodes. a randomized double-blind controlled trial with 77 hiv-infected children (2-12 years), divided into two groups: one receiving probiotics (formula containing bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus -2.5 x 10(10) colony forming units) and the other, a standard formula (control group), for 2 months. the cd4 counts (cells mm(-3)) were collected at the beginning and end of the study. the quality and number of stools were assessed by a questionnaire (watery  to normal stool consistency). there was an increase in the mean cd4 count in the  probiotics group (791 cells mm(-3)) and a small decrease in the control group (538 cells mm(-3)). the change from baseline in mean cd4 cell count was +118 cells mm(-3) vs. -42 cells mm(-3) for children receiving the probiotic formula and control formula, respectively (p = 0.049). a similar reduction in liquid stool consistency in both the groups (p < 0.06), with a slight enhancement in the probiotics group, was observed, but without significant difference (p < 0.522). the incidence of loose-soft stools showed a small decrease in both groups (p < 0.955) and there was an increase in the incidence of normal stool consistency in  both the groups (p < 0.01). our study showed that probiotics have immunostimulatory properties and might be helpful in the treatment of hiv-infected children.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == molecular identification of monomeric aspartate racemase from bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a useful probiotic agent exhibiting health-promoting properties and contains d-aspartate as an essential component of the cross-linker moiety in the peptidoglycan. to help understand d-aspartate biosynthesis in b. bifidum nbrc 14252, aspartate racemase, which catalyzes the racemization of d- and l-aspartate, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. the enzyme was a  monomer with a molecular mass of 27 kda. this is the first report showing the presence of a monomeric aspartate racemase. its enzymologic properties, such as its lack of cofactor requirement and susceptibility to thiol-modifying reagents in catalysis, were similar to those of the dimeric aspartate racemase from streptococcus thermophilus. the monomeric enzyme, however, showed a novel characteristic, namely, that its thermal stability significantly increased in the presence of aspartate, especially the d-enantiomer. the gene encoding the monomeric aspartate racemase was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli cells. the nucleotide sequence of the aspartate racemase gene encoded a peptide containing 241 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26 784 da. the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its properties were almost the same as those of the b. bifidum enzyme.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

TI  == the use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disease.
AB  == probiotics are living microorganisms that can affect the host in a beneficial manner. prebiotics are nondigestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria already established in the colon. efficacy of  probiotic compounds has been shown in a wide range of gastrointestinal diseases.  lactobacillus gg alone, or the combination of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus, is effective in the treatment of clostridium difficile, as well as in preventing the frequency and severity of infectious acute diarrhea in children. prevention of antibiotic-induced diarrhea with the concomitant administration of either lactobacillus gg or saccharomyces boulardii  has been demonstrated. the most successful studies involve the use of lactobacillus gg at a dose of 1 x 1010 viable organisms per day and the yeast boulardii at a dose of 1 g/day. a probiotic preparation (vsl#3 - 6 g/day) that uses a combination of three species of bifidobacterium, four strains of lactobacillus and one strain of streptocccus has shown promise in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and pouchitis, as well as in preventing the postoperative recurrence of crohn's disease. the mechanism of action of probiotics may include receptor competition, effects on mucin secretion or probiotic immunomodulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue. oral administration of probiotic compounds has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe. however, while probiotics have the potential to improve human health and to prevent and treat some diseases, major improvements are needed in labelling and quality assurance procedures for probiotic compounds. in addition, well planned and controlled clinical studies are necessary to delineate fully the potential for probiotic compounds.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical properties of canestrato pugliese hard cheese supplemented with bifidobacteria.
AB  == canestrato pugliese cheeses from ewe milk were produced according to a traditional protocol and by adding 7.0 log10 cfu of fresh cells per gram of bifidobacterium bifidum bb02, bifidobacterium longum bb46, or both species. the traditional technology was modified slightly to favor the survival of probiotic microorganisms. after 56 d of ripening, the survival of b. bifidum bb02 and b. longum bb46 was 6.0 and 5.0 log10 cfu/g, respectively. after 19 d cheeses contained ca. 7.0 log10 cfu/g of bifidobacteria. compared to traditional cheese,  the addition of bifidobacteria seemed to support the growth and survival of mesophilic lactobacilli and streptococcus thermophilus, used as starter, during ripening. no significant differences were observed in the main chemical composition, and only a slightly higher concentration of acetic acid was found in cheeses with bifidobacteria added. on the contrary, alpha- and beta-galactosidase activities were markedly more pronounced in the presence of bifidobacteria, especially with b. bifidum bb02. in contrast with traditional cheese, the lactose was completely hydrolyzed in cheeses made with bifidobacteria. urea-page electrophoresis of the ph 4.6-soluble and ph 4.6-insoluble n fractions did not show appreciable variations. only the reversed-phase-hplc analysis of the ph 4.6-soluble n showed a slightly more complex profile in the presence of bifidobacteria. this finding was in agreement with the higher value of the ph 4.6-soluble n/total n ratio and with the more pronounced amino-, imino-, and dipeptidase activities found in all the cheeses with the bifidobacteria added, especially b. bifidum bb02. no differences were found in the free amino acid and  free fatty acid contents. the amino acids glutamic acid, valine, proline, leucine, and lysine and the fatty acids butyric, caproic, capric, and oleic acids were found at the highest concentrations. the sensory evaluation did not show significant differences, and canestrato pugliese cheeses were characterized by small and uniformly distributed eyes, were pale yellow, had an elastic consistency and a pecorino-like smell, were very salty, and tended to be moderately piquant.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin a responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == stimulation of cytokine production in clonal macrophage and t-cell models by streptococcus thermophilus: comparison with bifidobacterium sp. and lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  == the effects of four commercial strains of streptococcus thermophilus used in yogurt manufacturing on cytokine production were evaluated by using a macrophage  model (raw 264.7 cells) and a t-helper-cell model (el4.il-2 thymoma cells) and compared to immunologically active strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. all cytokines (tnf-alpha and il-6 in raw 264.7 cells and il-2 and il-5 in el4.il-2 cells) were  affected by heat-killed s. thermophilus in a strain- and dose-dependent fashion.  organisms of all three genera induced significant increases in il-6 production by the macrophage line ranging from 31- to 192-fold, with s. thermophilus st 133 showing the greatest activity. the four s. thermophilus strains also strongly induced tnf-alpha production (from 135- to 176-fold). il-6 and, to a lesser extent, tnf-alpha production were also increased when the macrophages were costimulated with lipopolysaccharide and cells of the three groups of lactic acid bacteria. upon concurrent stimulation of el4.il-2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, seven of the eight strains displayed significant enhancement of il-2 and il-5 production, with s. thermophilus being most effective. taken together, the s. thermophilus strains stimulated macrophage and  t-cell cytokine production to a similar or greater extent than did the species of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus. these and previous results lend further support to the contention that lactic acid bacteria, in a concentration-dependent manner, can differentially induce cytokine production in macrophages, but that the effects on t cells required a costimulatory signal and were less remarkable.

TI  == survival of lactic acid bacteria in a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine: validation and the effects of bile.
AB  == this study was conducted to validate a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine to quantify the survival of lactic acid bacteria and to assess the influence of gastrointestinal secretions. the survival of a single strain of each of the following species, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus, was measured under physiological conditions (e.g., peristalsis, changes in ph, and changes in concentrations of enzymes and bile) and were compared with data obtained from humans. no significant differences were found between the in vitro and in vivo data, indicating that the model has a predictive value for the survival of these  bacteria in humans. the survival of these strains of lactic acid bacteria in the  gastrointestinal model was investigated under two different conditions in the small intestine: simulation of physiological secretion of bile and low bile secretion. reductions in viability were significantly different between the bacterial species. the dose-response effect of bile on the survival of the tested bacteria was significant, demonstrating the bactericidal effect of bile salts. this study demonstrates the differences among bacterial species in their sensitivity to gastric and intestinal secretions.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in yoghurt during preparation and storage at 4 degrees c.
AB  == cow's milk was inoculated with ca 10(3) and 10(7) cfu ml-1 escherichia coli o157:h7. after fermentation at 42 degrees c for 0-5 h, the yoghurt was stored at  4 degrees c. two kinds of yoghurt were used: traditional yoghurt (ty), made with  streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus starter cultures, and 'bifido' yoghurt (by), made with the two starter cultures plus bifidobacterium bifidum. after 7 d e. coli o157:h7 decreased from 3.52 to 2.72 log10 cfu ml-1 and from 7.08 to 5.32 log10 cfu ml-1 in ty, and from 3.49 to 2.73 log10 cfu ml-1 and  from 7.38 to 5.41 log10 cfu ml-1 in by. the ph values of yoghurt dropped from 6.6 to 4.5 and 4.4 in ty (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively), and from  6.6 to 4.6 and 4.5 in by (for low and high pathogen inocula, respectively).

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, lb. casei 20094, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, streptococcus thermophilus ts2, pediococcus pentosaceus pe39 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. the rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by mg2+, while the effect of k+ and na+ differed from strain to strain.  the beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. the types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in  each case, but the rates of their production differed. all the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  == it was shown that cell extracts and cells of streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strain ta1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. cell extracts and cells of bifidobacterium bifidum and propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. no antimutagenic effect was found in escherichia coli ab1157, lactobacillus delbrueckii, or streptococcus thermophilus. antimutageneicity of the cell extract of str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. thiol compounds produced by growing str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. a relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a mm less than 12 kda are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == feeding of bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus to infants in hospital for prevention of diarrhoea and shedding of rotavirus.
AB  == acute diarrhoea is a serious cause of infant morbidity and mortality, and the development of preventive measures remains an important goal. bifidobacteria (which constitute the predominant intestinal flora of breastfed infants), as well as other lactic-acid-producing organisms such as streptococcus thermophilus, are  thought to have a protective effect against acute diarrhoeal disease. however, their efficacy has not been assessed in controlled trials. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants aged 5-24 months who were admitted to a chronic medical care hospital were randomised to receive a standard infant formula or the same formula supplemented with bifidobacterium bifidum and s thermophilus. patients were evaluated daily for occurrence of diarrhoea, and faecal samples, obtained weekly, were analysed for rotavirus antigen by enzyme immunoassay. faecal samples were also obtained during an episode of diarrhoea for virological  and bacteriological analyses. 55 subjects were evaluated for a total of 4447 patient-days during 17 months. 8 (31%) of the 26 patients who received the control formula and 2 (7%) of 29 who received the supplemented formula developed  diarrhoea during the course of the study (p = 0.035, fisher's exact test, two-tailed). 10 (39%) of the subjects who received the control formula and 3 (10%) of those who received the supplemented formula shed rotavirus at some time  during the study (p = 0.025). the supplementation of infant formula with b bifidum and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of acute diarrhoea and rotavirus shedding in infants admitted to hospital.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
