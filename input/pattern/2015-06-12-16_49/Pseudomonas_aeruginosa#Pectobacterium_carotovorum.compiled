TI  - Deciphering the dual effect of lipopolysaccharides from plant pathogenic Pectobacterium.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a component of the outer cell surface of almost all Gram-negative bacteria and play an essential role for bacterial growth and survival. Lipopolysaccharides represent typical microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules and have been reported to induce defense-related responses, including the expression of defense genes and the suppression of the hypersensitive response in plants. However, depending on their origin and the challenged plant, LPS were shown to have complex and different roles. In this study we showed that LPS from plant pathogens Pectobacterium atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum induce common and different responses in A. thaliana cells when compared to those induced by LPS from non-phytopathogens Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among common responses to both types of LPS are the transcription of defense genes and their ability to limit of cell death induced by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. However, the differential kinetics and amplitude in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation seemed to regulate defense gene transcription and be determinant to induce programmed cell death in response to LPS from the plant pathogenic Pectobacterium. These data suggest that different signaling pathways could be activated by LPS in A. thaliana cells.
TI  - A sequence-based approach for prediction of CsrA/RsmA targets in bacteria with experimental validation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - CsrA/RsmA homologs are an extensive family of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-binding proteins that function as global post-transcriptional regulators controlling important cellular processes such as secondary metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and the production and secretion of virulence factors in diverse bacterial species. While direct messenger RNA binding by CsrA/RsmA has been studied in detail for some genes, it is anticipated that there are numerous additional, as yet undiscovered, direct targets that mediate its global regulation. To assist in the discovery of these targets, we propose a sequence-based approach to predict genes directly regulated by these regulators. In this work, we develop a computer code (CSRA_TARGET) implementing this approach, which leads to predictions for several novel targets in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The predicted targets in other bacteria, specifically Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Legionella pneumophila, also include global regulators that control virulence in these pathogens, unraveling intricate indirect regulatory roles for CsrA/RsmA. We have experimentally validated four predicted RsmA targets in P. aeruginosa. The sequence-based approach developed in this work can thus lead to several testable predictions for direct targets of CsrA homologs, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts to unravel global regulation by this important family of proteins.
TI  - [Detection of bacteriophages of siphoviridae family in Erwinia carotovora subsp.  carotovora].
AB  - It was established that the polylysogenic phage system of culture Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 91P includes: a) defective bacteriophages of Myoviridae family, which are displayed as macromolecular carotovoricins b) valuable highly unstable temperate phage, which can be attributed to the family Myoviridae, and which, perhaps, is an analogue of phage ZF40 [6], and c) resistant to osmotic shock temperate phage of family Siphoviridae. This phage, called TIRI, consists of isometric head 50 nm in diameter and a rigid tail structure 203 nm long. A characteristic feature of the phage tail is an evident transverse striation, which is also indicative for the tail-like particle of the defective temperate phage of the strain 48A-7/4b. In general, the phage system of E carotovora subsp. carotovora is similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its R- and F-bacteriocins, and phages of the families Myoviridae and Siphoviridae.
TI  - Discovery of a quorum sensing modulator pharmacophore by 3D small-molecule microarray screening.
AB  - The screening of large arrays of drug-like small-molecules was traditionally a time consuming and resource intensive task. New methodology developed within our laboratories provides an attractive low cost, 3D microarray-assisted screening platform that could be used to rapidly assay thousands of compounds. As a proof-of-principle the platform was exploited to screen a number of quorum sensing analogs. Quorum sensing is used by bacterium to initiate and spread infection; in this context its modulation may have significant clinical value. 3D microarray slides were probed with fluorescently labeled ligand-binding domains of the LuxR homolog CarR from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. The 3D microarray platform was used to discover the biologically active chloro-pyridine pharmacophore, which was validated using a fluorometric ligand binding assay and ITC. Analogs containing the chloro-pyridine pharmacophore were found to be potent inhibitors of N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) mediated quorum sensing phenotypes in Serratia (IC(50) = approximately 5 muM) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IC(50) = 10-20 muM).
TI  - Characterization of a new bacteriocin, Carocin D, from Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum Pcc21.
AB  - Two different bacteriocins, carotovoricin and carocin S1, had been found in Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, which causes soft-rot disease in diverse plants. Previously, we reported that the particular strain Pcc21, producing only one high-molecular-weight bacteriocin, carried a new antibacterial activity against the indicator strain Pcc3. Here, we report that this new antibacterial activity is due to a new bacteriocin produced by strain Pcc21 and named carocin D. Carocin D is encoded by the caroDK gene located in the genomic DNA together with the caroDI gene, which seems to encode an immunity protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified carocin D were determined by Edman degradation. In comparison with the primary translation product of caroDK, it was found that 8 amino acids are missing at the N terminus. This finding proved that carocin D is synthesized as a precursor peptide and that 8 amino acids are removed from its N terminus during maturation. Carocin D has two putative translocation domains; the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are homologous to those of Escherichia coli colicin E3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa S-type pyocin, respectively. When caroDK and caroDI genes were transformed into carocin D-sensitive bacteria such as Pcc3, the bacteria became resistant to this bacteriocin. Carocin D has one putative DNase domain at the extreme C terminus and showed DNase activity in vitro. This bacteriocin had slight tolerance to heat but not to proteases. The caroDK gene was present in only 5 of 54 strains of P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. These results indicate that carocin D is a third bacteriocin found in P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, and this bacteriocin can be readily expressed in carocin D-sensitive nonpathogenic bacteria, which may have high potential as a biological control agent in the field.
TI  - Natural products from isnA-containing biosynthetic gene clusters recovered from the genomes of cultured and uncultured bacteria.
AB  
TI  - The identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  - In an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Eurotium chevalieri, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum, Rhodotorula glutinis and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and ATCC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, E. coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. Results indicated that all fungal isolates except for Rh. glutinis and R. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. Rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas R. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. All bacterial isolates from fresh produce, P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and P. fluorescens (ATCC BAA-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/L) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/L). P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. P. carotovorum, E. coli, B. cereus and Staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.
TI  - Elsinochrome A production by the bindweed biocontrol fungus Stagonospora convolvuli LA39 does not pose a risk to the environment or the consumer of treated crops.
AB  - Biological control as an alternative to chemical pesticides is of increasing public interest. However, to ensure safe use of biocontrol methods, strategies to assess the possible risks need to be developed. The production of toxic metabolites is an aspect which has so far largely been neglected in the risk assessment and the registration process for biocontrol products. We have evaluated the risks of elsinochrome A (ELA) and leptosphaerodione production by the fungus Stagonospora convolvuli LA39, an effective biocontrol agent used against bindweeds. The toxicity of the two metabolites to bacteria, protozoa, fungi and plants was evaluated in in vitro assays. The most sensitive bacteria and fungi were already affected at 0.01-0.07 microM ELA, whereas plants were far less sensitive. Leptosphaerodione was less toxic than ELA. Subsequently, it was investigated whether ELA is present in the applied biocontrol product or LA39-treated bindweed and crop plants. In plants ELA was never detected and in the biocontrol product the ELA concentration was far too low to have toxic effects even on the most sensitive organisms. We conclude that the production of ELA by biocontrol strain LA39 does not pose a risk to the environment or to the consumer.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora gene encoding  the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin carocin S1.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clone the carocin S1 gene and express it in a non-carocin-producing strain of Erwinia carotovora. A mutant, TH22-10, which produced a high-molecular-weight bacteriocin but not a low-molecular-weight bacteriocin, was obtained by Tn5 insertional mutagenesis using H-rif-8-2 (a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 89-H-4). Using thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, the DNA sequence from the Tn5 insertion site and the DNA sequence of the contiguous 2,280-bp region were determined. Two complete open reading frames (ORF), designated ORF2 and ORF3, were identified within the sequence fragment. ORF2 and ORF3 were identified with the carocin S1 genes, caroS1K (ORF2) and caroS1I (ORF3), which, respectively, encode a killing protein (CaroS1K) and an immunity protein (CaroS1I). These genes were homologous to the pyocin S3 gene and the pyocin AP41 gene. Carocin S1 was expressed in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora Ea1068 and replicated in TH22-10 but could not be expressed in Escherichia coli (JM101) because a consensus sequence resembling an SOS box was absent. A putative sequence similar to the consensus sequence for the E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein binding site (-312 bp) was found upstream of the start codon. Production of this bacteriocin was also induced by glucose and lactose. The homology search results indicated that the carocin S1 gene (between bp 1078 and bp 1704) was homologous to the pyocin S3 and pyocin AP41 genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These genes encode proteins with nuclease activity (domain 4). This study found that carocin S1 also has nuclease activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Cichorium intybus.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of the water, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of Cichorium intybus was investigated. All the tested extracts showed antibacterial activity, the ethyl acetate extract being the most active. Water extract inhibits Agrobacterium radiobacter sp. tumefaciens, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - AiiA, an enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone quorum-sensing signal and attenuates the virulence of Erwinia carotovora.
AB  - N-acylhomoserine lactones, known as autoinducers (AIs), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. AIs are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions, including expression of pathogenic genes in the plant pathogens Pseudomonas solanacearum, several Erwinia species, and the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bacterial isolate, Bacillus sp. 240B1, is capable of enzymatic inactivation of AIs. The gene (aiiA) for AI inactivation from Bacillus sp. 240B1 has been cloned and shown to encode a protein of 250 amino acids. Sequence alignment indicates that AiiA contains a "HXHXDH" zinc-binding motif that is conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that conserved aspartate and most histidine residues are required for AiiA activity. Expression of aiiA in transformed Erwinia carotovora strain SCG1 significantly reduces the release of AI, decreases extracellular pectolytic enzyme activities, and attenuates pathogenicity on potato, eggplant, Chinese cabbage, carrot, celery, cauliflower, and tobacco. Our results indicate that the AI-inactivation approach represents a promising strategy for prevention of diseases in which virulence is regulated by AIs.
TI  - Quorum sensing and the cell-cell communication dependent regulation of gene expression in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Although it has been clear for some time that individual bacterial cells employ intra-cellular signalling systems to sense, integrate and process information from their surroundings, their widespread capacity to perceive information from other bacterial cells is only just beginning to be recognised. Recent work has established that diverse bacteria exploit a cell-cell communication device to regulate the transcription of multiple target genes. This communication device termed 'quorum sensing', depends on the production of one or more diffusible signal molecules termed 'autoinducers' or 'pheromones' which enable a bacterium to monitor its own cell population density. Quorum sensing is thus an example of multicellular behaviour in prokaryotes and regulates diverse physiological processes including bioluminescence, swarming, antibiotic biosynthesis, plasmid conjugal transfer and the production of virulence determinants in animal, fish and plant pathogens. In Gram-negative bacteria, the best understood family of signal molecules are the N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) which vary predominantly in the presence or absence of an acyl chain C3 substituent (oxo- or hydroxy-) and length of the N-acyl side chain. However not all quorum sensing signal molecules are AHLs; in Gram-positive bacteria, they are often post-translationally modified peptides. Irrespective of the chemical 'language' employed, interference with either the synthesis or transmission of a quorum sensing signal molecule in pathogenic bacteria offers an exciting new strategy for controlling infection.
TI  - The lux autoinducer regulates the production of exoenzyme virulence determinants  in Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa secrete exoenzymes that contribute  to the pathogenesis of plant and mammalian infections respectively. E.carotovora mutants defective in synthesis of the pectinase, cellulase and protease exoenzymes were isolated and classified into two groups. Group 2 mutants were found to be defective in the production of a small freely diffusible molecule, N-3-(oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine, lactone (HSL), and were avirulent. Addition of exogenous HSL to these group 2 mutants restores synthesis of the exoenzymes and virulence in planta. Of the exoenzymes of P.aeruginosa the metalloprotease, elastase, is an established virulence determinant. Mutants of P.aeruginosa that are defective in elastase production have been isolated and were again found to fall into two groups. Analogous to the group 2 mutants of E.carotovora, group 2 mutants of P. aeruginosa are defective in the synthesis of HSL and exogenous HSL restores elastase production. HSL has now been linked to the control of bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri, carbapenem antibiotic production of E.carotovora and the above exoenzyme virulence determinants. This information significantly enhances our understanding of the extent and nature of pheromone mediated gene expression control in prokaryotes.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the lexA genes from Salmonella typhimurium,  Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida were determined; the DNA sequences of the lexA genes from these bacteria were 86%, 76%, 61% and 59% similar, respectively, to the Escherichia coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora and P. putida LexA proteins are 202 residues long whereas that of P. aeruginosa is 204. Two putative LexA repressor binding sites were localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes, the distance between them being 5 bp in S. typhimurium and E. carotovora, as in the lexA gene of E. coli, and 3 bp in P. putida and P. aeruginosa. The first lexA site present in the lexA operator of all five bacteria is very well conserved. However, the second lexA box is considerably more variable. The Ala-84--Gly-85 bond, at which the LexA repressor of E. coli is cleaved during the induction of the SOS response, is also found in the LexA proteins of S. typhimurium and E. carotovora. Likewise, the amino acids Ser-119 and Lys-156 are present in all of these three LexA repressors. These residues also exist in the LexA proteins of P. putida and P. aeruginosa, but they are displaced by 4 and 6 residues, respectively. Furthermore, the structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of E. coli are highly conserved in the S. typhimurium, E. carotovora, P. aeruginosa and P. putida LexA proteins.
TI  - Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora extracellular protease: characterization and nucleotide sequence of the gene.
AB  - The prt1 gene encoding extracellular protease from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora EC14 in cosmid pCA7 was subcloned to create plasmid pSK1. The partial nucleotide sequence of the insert in pSK1 (1,878 bp) revealed a 1,041-bp open reading frame (ORF1) that correlated with protease activity in deletion mutants. ORF1 encodes a polypeptide of 347 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 38,826 Da. Escherichia coli transformed with pSK1 or pSK23, a subclone of pSK1, produces a protease (Prt1) intracellularly with a molecular mass of 38 kDa and a pI of 4.8. Prt1 activity was inhibited by phenanthroline, suggesting that it is a metalloprotease. The prt1 promoter was localized between 173 and 1,173 bp upstream of ORF1 by constructing transcriptional lacZ fusions. Primer extension identified the prt1 transcription start site 205 bp upstream of ORF1. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 showed significant sequence identity to metalloproteases from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus (thermolysin), B. subtilis (neutral protease), Legionella pneumophila (metalloprotease), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (elastase). It has less sequence similarity to metalloproteases from Serratia marcescens and Erwinia chrysanthemi. Locations for three zinc ligands and the active site for E. carotovora subsp. carotovora protease were predicted from thermolysin.
