TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. material and methods: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, sd+/-1.5). forty species were identified by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. neisseria mucosa, fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, p<0.05), the levels of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, p<0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, p<0.05), and micromonas micros (r=0.17, p=0.01). e. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (p<0.05). subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of f. nucleatum sp. vincentii (p<0.02) and n. mucosa (p<0.05). independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of p. gingivalis (p<0.05), and leptotrichia buccalis (p<0.05). conclusions: at implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

AB  == oral gram-negative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, provotella intermedius, provotella melaninogenicus, have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. an ultrasensitive antibacterial assay was applied to determine the sensitivity of a battery of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated human neutrophil defensins (hnp) and two kinds of rabbit  defensins np1 and np2. all species tested were killed by hnp, np1 and np2 except  that porphyromonas gingivalis was resistant to hnp. however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. it was concluded that the oral gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensinmediated bacterial killing.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  == prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. the girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. among the predominant species were porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of augmentin 312.5 mg and flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the  antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. all the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and a.actinomycetemcomitans  was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. the evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. the microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.

TI  == subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-hcl.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == [subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-hcl].
AB  == the present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. after sampling, periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. the detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution of  the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. in view of the mic of minocycline-hci for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including periocline. however, clinical strains of p. i. were considered to have  low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. in view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. from these results,  it was suggested that periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-hcl.

TI  == properties of alkaline phosphatase in the gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == the isoenzymic properties of the alkaline phosphatase (alp) of the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) were investigated and compared with those in other cells,  such as human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), and human periodontal ligament cells (pdls), and with those of three species of periodontopathic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis 381 (p. gingivalis), prevotella intermedia atcc25611 (p. intermedia), and capnocytophaga sputigena atcc33123 (c. sputigena). the biochemical properties of the isoenzymes were analyzed by the following methods:  enzyme assays, inhibition pattern using three chemical inhibitors, 4 to 20% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thermostability, immunological specificity, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc) treatment. the inhibition experiment showed that alp of the pmns and pdls possessed almost the same enzymatic properties of tissue-nonspecific alp (bone/liver/kidney; tnsalp), and the alp of the three species of periodontopathic bacteria possessed specific properties that were different from those of tnsalp,  intestinal, or placental alp. the alp of the gcf was only slightly susceptible to levamisole (1 mm), l-phenylalanine (20 mm), and sds (1%). an electrophoresis thermostability test demonstrated that the enzyme activity of the gcf was separated into one or two bands. the main heat-labile slow band contained the phosphatidylinositol (pi)-moiety-anchored alp and possessed immunological specificity against anti-bone type alp. the minor fast band was heat stable and showed mobility similar to that in p. gingivalis. these results indicated that the alp of the gcf consisted of several alp isoenzyme types whose possible origins are considered to be derived from phosphatidylinositol (pi) anchored alp  and periodontopathic bacterial alp.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

AB  == bacterial antigen fragments complexed with class ii major histocompatibility molecules (hla-d) on antigen presenting cells (apcs) stimulate cd4+ t lymphocyte  proliferation, presumably to protect the host. this study examined these responses to antigens of two periodontal pathogens in four groups (n = 15) of age- (young adult) and sex-matched caucasian subjects with or without type 1 diabetes and moderate to severe periodontitis: group dp = diabetics with periodontitis; group dnp = diabetics without periodontitis; group ndp = nondiabetics with periodontitis; and group ndnp = nondiabetics without periodontitis. hla-d phenotypes for each subject were determined by lymphocytotoxicity assays. t lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood were stimulated in cell culture with apc pulsed with various concentrations of tetanus toxoid, porphyromonas gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sputigena antigens. t lymphocyte reactivity (3h thymidine incorporation) was numerically lower in cultures from diabetics stimulated with unpulsed apc (not significant), and antigen-pulsed cultures showed low proliferation and no significant differences among groups. stimulation indices in cultures from diabetic patients stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. sputigena, however, were significantly elevated at all antigen concentrations compared to nondiabetic cultures. the occurrence of hla-dr4 was moderately associated with diabetes (p < 0.05) and highly associated  with periodontitis (p < 0.001, log-linear model for categorical variables); and hla-dr53 and hla-dq3 were significantly associated with periodontitis (p < or = 0.02). hla-dr was crucial to lymphocyte stimulation (anti-hla-dr blocking experiments), but the low peripheral blood t cell reactivity to antigens of periodontal pathogens could not be linked with hla-d type or periodontitis susceptibility.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  == phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium omiz-w1. none of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, selenomonas sputigena, treponema pectinovorum, t. socranskii, or wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine  methylester). phenylalanine was essential for the growth of capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium timidum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. with the exception of e. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow  when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.

TI  == use of synthetic oligonucleotide dna probes for the identification of different strains of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the n-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum strain fev1. probe h 2.1, was a randomly cloned  chromosomal dna fragment of 2.1 kbp. the specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different  oral species of six other genera. the chromosomal dna of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes hincii, hindiii, ecori, ecorv and sau3ai. digests were run on agarose gels and subjected  to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. the results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic dna from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe h 2.1. probe h 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. by use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of f. nucleatum could be  performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and leptotrichia buccalis. the probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.

TI  == isolation and purification of bacteriocin from prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius).
AB  == thirty-three out of 46 strains of prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. thirteen isolates did not have the ability to  inhibit the growth of p. intermedia strain atcc 25611. an inhibition factor from  one of the isolates, p. intermedia th14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. bacteriocin th14 activity was effective against only p. intermedia atcc 25611 and fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including p. intermedia atcc 33563, porphyromonas gingivalis (bacteroides gingivalis), capnocytophaga sputigena and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin th14. bacteriocin th14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain atcc 25611 in 15 minutes. the growth inhibition of p. intermedia atcc 25611 by bacteriocin th14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group,  98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis,  2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates,  79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8  isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of  10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in  several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.
