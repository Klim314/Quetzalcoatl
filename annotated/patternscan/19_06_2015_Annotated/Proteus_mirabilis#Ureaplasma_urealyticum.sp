TI  == comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the national institutes of health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == we examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. the following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a croatian translation of the nih cpsi questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and stamey localization technique). patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in croatia. an infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), enterococcus in 36 (19%) and escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. in the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: ureaplasma urealyticum, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by e. coli and enterococcus (p<0.001). clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by c. trachomatis, enterococcus and e. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by t. vaginalis.

TI  == etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "dr. fran mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  == a total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the outpatient department for urogenital infections, university hospital for infectious diseases "dr. fran mihaljevic" zagreb, croatia. disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, trichomonas vaginalis in 85, escherichia coli in 68, enterococcus in 51, proteus  mirabilis in 20, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, streptococcus agalactiae in 15, ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. other patients had mixed infection. in 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 wbcs/hpf) was found in eps or vb3. normal wbcs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom c. trachomatis was detected in eps or vb3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.

TI  == canine cathelicidin (k9cath): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection.  although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel  canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath  peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype  enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial  activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == the role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  == a total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the outpatient department for urogenital infections, university hospital for infectious diseases "dr. fran mihaljevic", zagreb, croatia. an infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. in 561  of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 wbc/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (eps) or voided bladder urine (vb(3)). normal, <10 wbcs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom chlamydia trachomatis was detected in eps or vb(3), in 51 of  151 (33.8%) patients with isolated trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%)  patients with isolated ureaplasma urealyticum. escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, enterococcus in 68, proteus mirabilis in 37, klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. other patients had a mixed infection. in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (cbp) caused by e. coli, p. mirabilis, k. pneumoniae, e. or s. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in eps or vb(3).

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction to detect proteus mirabilis and ureaplasma urealyticum in urinary calculi.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in detecting urea-splitting microorganisms in desiccated urinary tract infection  stones. seventy-eight urinary tract stones were tested for the presence of proteus mirabilis and ureaplasma urealyticum by means of pcr with species-specific primers. twenty-seven stone samples were composed of struvite and/or carbonate apatite (infection stone); 40 were calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate; seven were mixed, with struvite/carbonate apatite and calcium  oxalate; and four were uric acid stones. pcr was performed with dna extracted from pulverized stone pieces. initial assays using the pulverized stone specimens spiked with microorganisms showed that pcr could not detect u. urealyticum at densities below 10(3) color changing units (ccu), or p. mirabilis at densities below 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu). pcr was negative for u. urealyticum and p. mirabilis in all metabolic stones from patients. p. mirabilis was detected by  pcr in 10 of 34 patients with infection stones. preoperative urine cultures grew  p. mirabilis in three of these 10 patients, and were negative for p. mirabilis in the other seven. u. urealyticum was detected by pcr in stone samples from four patients, two of which were also pcr-positive for p. mirabilis. all four of these patients had infection stones: two had residual stones, and the other two had recurrence of urinary stones after their operations. these results demonstrate that microorganisms in urinary stones can be detected by pcr even when the voided urine culture is negative. investigations into the role of bacterial infection in stone formation will require further improvements in the sensitivity of pcr assays for pathogen detection.

TI  == the effect of positive semen bacterial and ureaplasma cultures on in-vitro fertilization success.
AB  == a total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (ivf) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. the most common bacteria isolated from semen were enterococcus spp. (73%). the presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the ivf procedure compared with  those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). those patients with semen cultures positive for escherichia coli prior to the ivf procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for e.coli at the time of the attempt. the group of patients with staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of ivf also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. none of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. in conclusion, the presence of enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following ivf. e.coli, s.aureus and ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.

TI  == intra-uterine infection in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes: maternal and neonatal characteristics.
AB  == objective: our purpose was to determine the prevalence of intra-uterine infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes and to evaluate the clinical characteristics of women and neonates according to the presence or absence of intrauterine infection. study design: trans-abdominal amniocentesis was performed in 90 consecutive patients admitted with preterm premature rupture  of membranes. maternal clinical parameters evaluated included maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, previous  preterm birth, urinary tract infection, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval and cesarean rate. neonatal clinical parameters evaluated were gestational age at delivery, birth weight, apgar score, neonatal gender, perinatal death and neonatal sepsis. results: the prevalence of intra-uterine infection was 66.6% (60/90). no differences between patients with intra-uterine infection and those without intra-uterine infection were observed in maternal age, origin, gravidity, parity, habitual abortion, previous perinatal death, fetal distress, abruptio placentae, gestational diabetes, admission-delivery interval, cesarean section, neonate's gender, apgar  score at 5 min and neonatal sepsis. on the other hand, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and apgar score at 1 min were significantly different between the groups. conclusion: an intra-uterine infection was found in two thirds of women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes. women presenting with preterm premature rupture of membranes and intra-uterine infection had a lower gestational age at delivery and consequently had a lower neonatal birth weight than those without intra-uterine infection.

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus clindamycin in the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.
AB  == sixty-eight patients with postpartum endomyometritis were enrolled in this open randomized comparative study. forty-two patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 26 received clindamycin. the cure rates were similar in the two groups: 83% in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and 88% in the clindamycin group. the most frequent endometrial bacterial isolates were bacteroides bivius, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and ureaplasma urealyticum. bacteremia was present in 15 of 68 (22%), the most frequent isolates being mycoplasma (four cases) and b bivius (three cases). clindamycin-resistant species were s faecalis, e coli, and  proteus mirabilis. there were seven treatment failures in the ampicillin/sulbactam group; only one isolate (an e coli) was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam. in a significant number of these failures, mycoplasma was isolated. ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin were found to be equally efficacious in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.

TI  == morphological lesions of the rat urinary tract induced by inoculation of mycoplasmas and other urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == the effects on the urinary tract after inoculation of ureaplasma urealyticum into the rat bladder were evaluated and compared to that seen after mycoplasma hominis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis inoculation. the inoculation of the urease-producing organisms p. mirabilis and u. urealyticum were associated with the formation of struvite bladder stones and predominantly hyperplastic lesions of the bladder. the p. mirabilis inoculated rats also displayed marked pyelonephritis. a similar but much less pronounced reaction also occurred in the  kidneys of some of the u. urealyticum inoculated rats. p. mirabilis could frequently be recultured. in contrast, this was not possible with u. urealyticum, but the organism was detected by scanning electron microscopy 2 weeks after the inoculation. inoculation of m. hominis was associated with a few mild lesions of  the bladder, but inflammatory lesions were not present in the kidneys. the study  confirms the potential of ureaplasma to form struvite stones in rat urinary tract. it also demonstrates that it can induce inflammatory changes in both bladder and kidney of rats without concomitant stone formation.

TI  == adherence of urease-induced crystals to rat bladder epithelium following acute infection with different uropathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == apart from urine supersaturation with respect to struvite and calcium phosphate,  crystal retention is considered to be necessary for the formation of infection stones. this study was performed to investigate the role of the mucous coat in rat bladders in the adhesion of sterile urease-induced crystals and to determine  to what extent the adhesion was influenced by infection. elimination of the mucous coat with 0.1 m hcl increased the adherence of crystals six times compared to that in bladders with an intact mucous coat. infection with proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterococci and ureaplasma urealyticum increased the adherence  six, five, four and two times, respectively. injury to the mucous coat may thus be one mechanism by which microorganisms can contribute to the formation of infection stones in the urinary tract.

TI  == specific inhibition of urease by n-acylphosphoric triamides.
AB  == benzoyl- and isopentenoyl phosphoric triamides (bpa and ipa) strongly inhibited urease activities from jack bean, soybean, watermelon seed, proteus mirabilis, p. rettgeri, p. vulgaris, mycobacterium smegmatis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. their i50 values (the final concentration causing 50% inhibition), independent of enzyme source, were 2-21 nm, which are about 1,000-fold lower than that of caprylohydroxamic acid, one of the most potent urease inhibitors. atp-urea amidolyase activity was inhibited 50% by bpa at a higher concentration of 0.28 mm, but was not affected by ipa even at 1.3 mm. thirteen kinds of hydrolases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, leucine aminopeptidase, papain, lipase, alpha-amylase, glucuronidase, asparaginase, arylsulfatase, alkaline phosphatase,  acid phosphatase, and true cholinesterase), two oxidoreductases (catalase and alcohol dehydrogenase), three transferases (glutamic-oxaloacetic aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and arylsulfotransferase) and two kinases (pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase) were not affected at all even at 1 mm bpa and ipa. exceptionally, pseudo-cholinesterase from human serum was inhibited by bpa and ipa, whose i50 values were 70 nm and 10 mum, respectively, using acetylthiocholine as a substrate. these values increased to 0.55 mum and 54 mum, respectively, when acetylcholine was used as a substrate. these results show that n-acylphosphoric triamides potently and specifically inhibit urease activity at concentrations of nm order.

TI  == concrement formation in the urinary bladder in rats inoculated with ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == to study the concrement-forming ability of ureaplasma urealyticum in the urinary  tract, viable and heat-killed ureaplasmas as well as urease and non-urease-producing bacteria were inoculated into the bladder in rats. viable ureaplasmas, in contrast to heat-killed, caused the formation of bladder stones with a frequency corresponding to urease-producing bacteria (proteus mirabilis).  it was not possible to reculture the inoculated ureaplasmas from the urinary tract. non-urease producing microorganisms (escherichia coli and mycoplasma hominis) only occasionally induced stone formation. the results indicate that u.  urealyticum can initiate stone formation, a property that appears to be associated with the urease activity of the organism.

TI  == ureaplasma urealyticum-induced crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium phosphates in synthetic urine.
AB  == crystallization of struvite and calcium phosphates was studied in vitro as encrustations on glass rods immersed in synthetic urine, to evaluate the crystallization capacity of ureaplasma urealyticum and compare it with that of known urease and non-urease-producing bacteria. inoculation of the synthetic urine with ureaplasma urealyticum resulted in alkalinization of the synthetic urine and crystallization of struvite and brushite. inoculation with proteus mirabilis caused a faster and more pronounced alkalinization as well as crystallization of struvite and apatite. the alkalinization and crystallization caused by ureaplasma urealyticum and proteus mirabilis was completely prevented by acetohydroxamic acid, a potent urease inhibitor, linking the crystallization to the urease activity of the microorganisms. when the synthetic urine was inoculated with urease-negative escherichia coli no alkalinization and no crystallization were seen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
