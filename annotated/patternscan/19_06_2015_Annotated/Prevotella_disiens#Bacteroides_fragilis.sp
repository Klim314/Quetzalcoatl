TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == comparison of activities of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) and five other agents against 585 anaerobes with use of three media.
AB  == agar dilution testing was used to compare the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin against 585 anaerobes. the activity of trovafloxacin was superior to  those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with 94%, 91%, 96%, 100%, 90%, and 100% inhibition of bacteroides fragilis, non-fragilis bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus magnus/peptostreptococcus micros, clostridium perfringens, prevotella bivia/prevotella disiens, and fusobacterium species, respectively, at  a breakpoint of 2 micrograms/ml. trovafloxacin was more active than clindamycin against most anaerobes and slightly less active than imipenem and metronidazole.  different testing media, which were compared side by side, did affect the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin but did not affect those of the other antibiotics. testing with supplemented brain-heart infusion agar demonstrated lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than did testing with wilkins-chalgren agar and supplemented brucella agar. the activity of trovafloxacin was twofold lower when the ph of the testing media was adjusted  to 6.0 than when the ph of the testing media was adjusted to 7.0 or 7.5.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  == one hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 gardnerella vaginalis, 16 mobiluncus spp., 19 peptostreptococcus spp., 20 lactobacillus spp., 20 prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 bacteroides fragilis group, 12 clostridium spp., and five fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference (brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. for the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). the quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. results with b. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. the absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. the etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == multivariate analyses of fatty acid data from whole-cell methanolysates of prevotella, bacteroides and porphyromonas spp.
AB  == the genus bacteroides contains a number of biochemically and physiologically heterogeneous groups of organisms and needs taxonomic revision. in this study cellular fatty acids from a number of bacteroides spp. were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the chemical data were then subjected to principal components analysis. in b. fragilis, which is the type species of the genus bacteroides, c3-oh-iso17 was the predominant fatty acid (38.0%) and cante15 was present in higher amounts (32.7%)  than ciso15 (14.6%). b. fragilis thus differed from all the other species examined: prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, p. (b.) oralis, p. (b.) oris, p. (b.)  disiens, p. (b.) veroralis, p. (b.) heparinolytica and porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis. principal components analysis also enabled the closely related p. buccae, p. oralis and p. oris to be differentiated.

TI  == multivariate analyses of cellular fatty acids in bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp.
AB  == the genera bacteroides, wolinella, and campylobacter contain several similar species that require taxonomic revision. fatty acid profiles of whole bacterial cells have proven useful for taxonomy. in this study, cellular fatty acids from bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp. were identified and quantitated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data were subjected to principal component analyses. bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, was distinct from the other organisms. while bacteroides gracilis, wolinella succinogenes, wolinella curva, wolinella recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis were  close to each other, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella oris, prevotella disiens, prevotella veroralis, prevotella heparinolyticus, porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis, and bacteroides ureolyticus could be distinguished. b. fragilis was characterized by the presence of c3oh-i-1-, ca-15, and ci-15 and the absence of c12:0 and unsaturated fatty acids. for comparison, b. gracilis, b. ureolyticus, w. succinogenes, w. curva, w. recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis contained c12:0, c16:1, c18:1, and c3-oh-14 acids but lacked branched hydroxy and branched nonhydroxy acids. b.  gracilis and b. ureolyticus are not "true" bacteroides.

TI  == chromosomal dna probes for the identification of bacteroides species.
AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.

TI  == anaerobes and septic abortion.
AB  == the bacterial flora of the genital tracts of twenty-two patients with septic abortion and twenty normal women (as controls) were studied to determine the significant aetiological agents. the predominant flora qualitatively and quantitatively in the twenty-two patients were anaerobes. bacteroides bivius was  isolated from all the twenty-two patients and from twelve out of twenty normal controls. the next commonest anaerobes were b. asaccharolyticus (fourteen out of  twenty-two patients), b. melaninogenicus (ten out of twenty-two), b. fragilis (eleven out of twenty-two), b. disiens (eight out of twenty-two) and anaerobic cocci (six out of twenty-two); they were also isolated from nine out of twenty, twelve, zero, eight and three control subjects respectively. the commonest facultative bacteria isolated from both the patients and afebrile controls were escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes and streptococcus faecalis. the comparative increase in number of patients colonized by the anaerobes and the increase in the bacteria, by quantitative assessment in the patient group, signify the importance of anaerobes in septic abortion.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic bacteroides species.
AB  == various bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. the data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using gower's similarity coefficients (sg) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. the highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of capnocytophaga (formerly bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. the phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. most of the 'bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, bact. bivius and a new species, bact. denticola, formed another group. another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to bact. oralis such as bact. buccalis and bact. pentosaceus. the less saccharolytic strains of bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. the low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. the non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. the separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.

TI  == rapid detection and identification of bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides melaninogenicus by immunofluorescence.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus group fluorescent-antibody kits were evaluated with 188 clinical specimens and 116 fresh aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates. fluorescent-antibody and culture  results corresponded in 88% of clinical specimens of the b. fragilis group and 94% of clinical specimens of the b. melaninogenicus group. there was greater than or equal to 90% correlation for both kits with colony smears. antigen sharing by  bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, and b. melaninogenicus was demonstrated.

TI  == the isolation and identification of bacteroides ssp. from the normal human vaginal flora.
AB  == the occurrence of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli in the normal vaginal flora was studied in 20 normal healthy women attending a family-planning clinic. a swab was taken from the cervix and posterior fornix and bacteroides spp. were isolated on  a selective medium from 13 (65%) subjects. a heavy growth of bacteroides was obtained from 11 specimens but only a few colonies were isolated from two specimens. where possible, 10 representative colonies from each subject were studied and 113 isolates were identified by conventional bacteriological tests. most isolates (78%) belonged to the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group. the commonest species identified in this group were the b. bivius/disiens complex (42%), b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius (22%) and ss. melaninogenicus (16%). asaccharolytic strains were isolated in smaller numbers from 54% of subjects, but only five strains of the b. fragilis group were isolated from two subjects; fusobacteria were not detected.
