TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
