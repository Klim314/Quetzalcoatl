TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == gtfa and gtfb are both required for protein o-glycosylation in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == acm2, the major autolysin of lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, was recently found to be o-glycosylated with n-acetylhexosamine, likely n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac). in this study, we set out to identify the glycosylation machinery by employing a  comparative genomics approach to identify gtf1 homologues, which are involved in  fimbria-associated protein 1 (fap1) glycosylation in streptococcus parasanguinis. this in silico approach resulted in the identification of 6 candidate l. plantarum wcfs1 genes with significant homology to gtf1, namely, tage1 to tage6.  these candidate genes were targeted by systematic gene deletion, followed by assessment of the consequences on glycosylation of acm2. we observed a changed mobility of acm2 on sds-page in the tage5e6 deletion strain, while deletion of other tage genes resulted in acm2 mobility comparable to that of the wild type. subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of excised and in-gel-digested acm2 confirmed the loss of glycosylation on acm2 in the tage5e6 deletion mutant, whereas a lectin blot using glcnac-specific succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (swga) revealed that besides acm2, tage5e6 deletion also abolished all but one other swga-reactive, protease-sensitive signal. only complementation of both tage5 and tage6 restored those swga lectin signals, establishing that tage5 and tage6 are both required for the glycosylation of acm2 as well as the vast majority of other swga-reactive proteins. finally, swga lectin blotting experiments using a panel of 8 other l. plantarum strains revealed that protein glycosylation is a common feature in l. plantarum strains. with the establishment of these enzymes as protein glycosyltransferases, we propose to rename tage5 and  tage6 as gtfa and gtfb, respectively.
