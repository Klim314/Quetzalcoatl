antibacterial and antifungal lysozyme-type activity in cameraria ohridella pupae.
lysozyme-type antibacterial and antifungal activity in pupae of cameraria ohridella was studied. activity against micrococcus luteus and bacillus megaterium was detected in pupae extract. also antifungal activity from c. ohridella pupae extract directed against saccharomyces cerevisiae strain w 303 was shown. during immunoblotting two bands in pupae extract, with molecular mass of about 15 and 28 kda were recognized by antibodies directed against hewl. after acid electrophoresis followed by bioautography of the extract, two lytic zones showing lysozyme-type activity against m. luteus were observed. two bacteria: gram-positive aerococcus viridans and gram-negative aeromonas salmonicida ssp. masoucida were isolated from pupae of c. ohridella. their activity against m. luteus, b. megaterium, and s. cerevisiae w303 was detected. after immunoblotting with antibodies against hewl, also two proteins from bacterial suspensions of a. viridans and a. salmonicida were detected, about 15 and 28 kda.
