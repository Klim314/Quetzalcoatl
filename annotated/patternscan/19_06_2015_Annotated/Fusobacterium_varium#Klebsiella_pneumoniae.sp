TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
