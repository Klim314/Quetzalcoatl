TI  - Assessment of intestinal microbiota modulation ability of Bifidobacterium strains in in vitro fecal batch cultures from preterm neonates.
AB  - Microbial colonization of the infant gut is essential for the development of the  intestine and the immune system. The intestinal microbiota of full-term breast-fed infants is considered as the health standard for newborns. A culture medium containing formula milk was designed, which allowed a balanced growth of intestinal microorganisms and was used to perform fecal batch cultures from preterm babies. Sixteen Bifidobacterium strains and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were tested for their ability to modulate in vitro the intestinal microbiota. The production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was measured by Gas Chromatography and the levels of some anaerobe (Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides groups) and facultative anaerobes (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Weissella group, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were determined by quantitative PCR. Results were referred to a fecal negative control culture without microorganisms or FOS added. Strains that in fecal cultures counteracted better the aberrancies previously found in feces of preterm babies, as compared with full-term breast-fed infants, were selected. The three Bifidobacterium bifidum strains tested in this work promoted the most suitable shifts in SCFA and in the ratio of variables facultative anaerobes to anaerobes. Two Bifidobacterium breve strains complied with the requirement for facultative anaerobes and anaerobes and one of them also promoted a suitable shift of SCFA. Bifidobacteria behaved similarly as FOS regarding the microbial profiles in fecal cultures but the production of lactic and acetic acid was much lower. B. breve and B. bifidum strains selected represent promising candidates for their assessment in more complex in vitro and in vivo models.
TI  - [Interaction of Bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Study the influence of exometabolites of B. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcusfaecium and Escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. As opportunistic microorganisms cultures of E. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were used. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. In the first series of experiments influence of B. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. In the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. Growth properties (GP), biofilm formation (BFF) and anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. Optical density measurement were performed on ELx808 (BioTek, U.S.A.) photometer. The data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using Mann-Whitney criteria. RESULTS: B. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, BFF and ALA of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. Features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on BFF of associants were revealed. The maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" E. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as E. faecium--S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
TI  - Real-time PCR analysis of the intestinal microbiotas in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can beneficially affect the host by producing acetic acid and lactic acid, which lower pH and thereby inhibit the growth of pathogens or allow the probiotic bacteria to compete with pathogens for epithelial adhesion sites and nutrients. The transmural migration of enteric organisms into the peritoneal cavity can cause peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We hypothesized that the composition of the intestinal microbiota with regard to Lactobacillus species and Bifidobacterium species differed between PD patients and healthy controls. The aim of the study was to investigate these differences by real-time PCR analysis of fecal samples. From 1 August 2009 to 31 March 2010, a total of 29 nondiabetic PD patients and 41 healthy controls from China Medical University Hospital were recruited after giving their informed consent. Fecal samples were collected from the PD patients and their age-matched counterparts in the morning using a standardized procedure. DNA extracted from these samples was analyzed by real-time PCR. All bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, B. longum, B. bifidum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were less frequently detected in the patient samples. Dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) may impair intestinal barrier function and increase host vulnerability to pathogen invasion. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings before clinical trials with probiotic supplementation in PD patients.
TI  - Effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  - Patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. This can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Enteral nutrition (EN) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. A continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of EN patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus DUN-311, Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-02, Bifidobacterium lactis BL-01, Synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. A PEG tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. The synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (SSSM) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after PEG tube insertion. The synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on PEG tube surfaces, with suppression of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to PEG insertion. When synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to PEG insertion, colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Candida famata was also inhibited. Lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (SSSM). These results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on PEG tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.
TI  - [Influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  - AIM: To assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Rhodotorula rubra isolated by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. In order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. Nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria for obtaining the control samples. Formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. RESULTS: Performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. Changes of these characteristics was observed both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Obtained data open perspective for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - [The effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  - The present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: Bacterium bifidum 1, B. adolescentis MC-42, B. longum B. 379M, Staphylococcus aureus P 209 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 52. Phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain S. aureus 209. The stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - [Interaction between Bifidobacterium bifidum, Proteus vulgaris, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 204 in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic chicks].
AB  - Experiments on gnotobiont chickens indicated that the strains B. bifidum 1/85 phi, P. vulgaris F-30 and K. pneumoniae 204, when introduced simultaneously into the gastrointestinal tract in a single administration, proliferate there with the pronounced predominance of bifidobacteria. 6 additional administrations of B. bifidum 1/85 phi culture resulted in the complete suppression of microorganisms belonging to the genera Rroteus and Klebsiella as early as 10 days after the introduction of bifidobacteria. These data suggest that it is necessary to use B. bifidum 1/85 phi in cases of intestinal dysbacteriosis characterized by the predominance of microorganisms belonging to the genera Proteus and Klebsiella.
