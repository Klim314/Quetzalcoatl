TI  - Update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  - The genus Fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. A potentially new subspecies of F. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5 subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. Two subspecies have been described for Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, Fusobacterium equinum, which is related to F. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. Additional molecular studies have characterized Fusobacterium ulcerans as separate from the phenotypically similar Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium. Fusobacterium sulci and Fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as Eubacterium sulci and Filifactor alocis, respectively. Fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the Eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. The status of the remaining species is unchanged.
TI  - 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Fusobacterium.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of all currently defined Fusobacterium species and related taxa such as Leptotrichia buccalis, Sebaldella termitidis and Streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. For the ITS-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. The majority of the Fusobacterium strains, along with L. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. Nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus Fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. The ITS region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. Analyses of the ITS-DNA sequences and ITS relative length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. The results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between Fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus Fusobacterium. Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with Fusobacterium naviforme, Fusobacterium simiae and Fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. Other clusters were formed by Fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with Fusobacterium gonidaformans and by Fusobacterium varium with Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium ulcerans. Fusobacterium russii as well as Fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. Fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and Fusobacterium varium and Fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution ITS level.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the United States.
AB  - The activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity against almost all anaerobes. Norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (MIC90, 8- > 256 micrograms/mL) except against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. Norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some Bacteroides species. While ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 4-16 micrograms/mL), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its MIC90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. Ofloxacin is active against B. fragilis (MIC90, 4-8 micrograms/mL) but not against other species of the B. fragilis group (MIC90, 8-32 micrograms/mL); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/mL. Several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). CI-960 and WIN 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/mL. CI-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/mL, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. CI-990 is active against more than 85% of B. fragilis strains (MIC90, 4 micrograms/mL), but other species of the B. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/mL for inhibition; Prevotella bivia, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of members of the genus Fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus Fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of these organisms. The sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. The four species Fusobacterium nucleatum (including F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "F. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), Fusobacterium alocis, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did the two species Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Fusobacterium russii and Fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. The sequence data are discussed in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.
TI  - Pathways of glutamate catabolism among Fusobacterium species.
AB  - Glutamate is a major source of energy for Fusobacterium species but its mode of catabolism has not hitherto been elucidated. Cell suspensions of F. nucleatum and F. varium, as representative species from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, respectively, both decarboxylated position-labelled glutamate but by different pathways. 14CO2 was released only from C-5 by F. nucleatum whereas F. varium decarboxylated glutamate at either C-1 or C-5. In both species, 2 mols of glutamate fermented yielded 2 mols of acetate and 1 mol of butyrate, suggesting the possibility of three metabolic pathways: the 2-oxoglutarate, mesaconate and 4-aminobutyrate pathways. Enzymes representative of the three pathways were assayed for in cell-free extracts of fusobacteria. All species tested possessed high levels of both glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase, indicating the presence of the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. Enzymes representative of the mesaconate pathway were detected in F. sulci, F. ulcerans, F. mortiferum and F. varium, while the latter two species also possessed the 4-aminobutyrate pathway. The pathways of glutamate catabolism therefore bore no relationship to the site of isolation of the fusobacteria tested but instead correlated with their chemotaxonomic properties. Thus, F. varium, F. mortiferum, F. ulcerans and F. sulci, which possess a peptidoglycan structure based on diaminopimelic acid, have either two or three pathways for glutamate catabolism whereas F. nucleatum and other species that have a lanthionine-based murein metabolized glutamate solely by the 2-oxoglutarate pathway.
