TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical aspects of corynebacterium].
AB  == the microbiologists use the term corynebacteria to describe aerobically growing,  asporogenous, irregularly sharped gram-positive rods. they comprise strictly aerobic bacteria isolated from environment as well as preferentially anaerobic bacteria found in clinical specimens. a large part of these bacteria is considered as commensal of skin and mucous membranes. this group of organisms has recently been subjected to considerable taxonomic revisions, which have resulted  in the proposal of several new species, many of them representing previous centers for diseases control coryneform groups. moreover, recent investigations demonstrated the existence of a pathogenic role for some of them. these bacteria  comprise well-known pathogens such as c. diphtheriae responsible for diphtheria,  actinomyces spp. responsible for actinomycosis and arcanobacterium haemolyticum recovered from pharyngitis, but other corynebacteria were related to particular infections. for example, the lipophilic and antibiotics multiresistant species corynebacterium urealyticum and c. jeikeium were found to be responsible for urinary tract infections and septicemias, respectively. the recently described species turicella otitidis was found to be implicated in otitis media and c. seminale were recovered from genital specimens of male patients. implantation of  material devices, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics led to an increase of sepsis  due to the species c. jeikeium and c. amycolatum. many of the new actinomyces species grow well under aerobic conditions and are often implicated in various abscesses. moreover an increase of immunocompromised patients led to the development of infections due to the aerobic actinomycete rhodococcus equi. the association of some corynebacteria with particular diseases should prompt the microbiologist to identify these bacteria when they are encountered in a pathogenic situation. identification of the major part of corynebacteria isolated from clinical specimens can now be achieved by using recent schemes.

TI  == artificial transmission of bolo disease in woolled sheep and attempted characterisation of the causative unclassified corynebacterium sp.
AB  == bacterial isolates (n = 38) previously cultured from sheep with bolo disease were compared bacteriologically with known corynebacterium spp. and actinomyces spp. the isolates did not conform to any previously described species but closely resembled c. pseudodiptheriticum and c. urealyticum. more comprehensive tests are needed to classify this corynebacterium sp. bacterial cultures of this unclassified corynebacterium sp. were used artificially to induce bolo disease in dohne merino sheep (n = 20). ten sheep were kept at middelburg in the cape midlands (northern cape) under arid conditions and another 10 at queenstown in the eastern cape in a more humid climate. two suspensions containing 2.8 x 10(5)  corynebacterium sp. (inoculum a) and 2.8 x 10(9) corynebacterium sp. (inoculum b) respectively were used to infect each sheep on 9 different sites on the skin. one sheep died during the course of the experiment. corynebacterium sp. established itself on 81 out of 171 inoculation sites of the remaining sheep and caused typical lesions of bolo disease, clinically and pathologically. bolo disease lesions developed slowly over 175 days at middelburg and 287 days at queenstown.  weather conditions were unfavourable to the development of fleece-rot and mycotic dermatitis. no difference was seen in lesion development between rams and ewes or between sheep with 5 months' wool growth and those which were shorn before inoculation. more lesions developed with the higher concentration of inoculum b (49 sites positive) as compared to inoculum a (32 sites positive).
