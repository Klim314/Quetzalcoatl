TI  == hormetic effect of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate on bacteria.
AB  == the biological effect of ionic liquids (ils) is one of the highly debated topics  as they are being contemplated for various industrial applications. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([emim][ac]) showed remarkable hormesis on anaerobic clostridium sp. and aerobic pseudomonas putida. bacterial growth was stimulated at up to 2.5 g l(-1) and inhibited at >2.5 g l(-1) of [emim][ac]. the  growth of clostridium sp. and p. putida were higher by 0.4 and 4-fold respectively, in the presence of 0.5 g l(-1) [emim][ac]. assessment of the effect of [emim][ac] under different growth conditions showed that the hormesis of [emim][ac] was mediated via regulation of medium ph. hormetic effect of [emim][ac] was evident only in medium with poor buffering capacity and in the presence of a fermentable substrate as the carbon source. the hormetic effect of  [emim][ac] on bacterial growth is most likely associated with the buffering capacity of acetate anion. these observations have implications in ils toxicity studies and ecological risk assessment.

TI  == tailor-made type ii pseudomonas pha synthases and their use for the biosynthesis  of polylactic acid and its copolymer in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == previously, we have developed metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains capable of producing polylactic acid (pla) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] by employing evolved clostridium propionicum propionate coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). introduction of mutations four sites (e130, s325, s477, and q481) of phac1( ps6-19) have been found to affect the polymer content,  lactate mole fraction, and molecular weight of p(3hb-co-la). in this study, we have further engineered type ii pseudomonas pha synthases 1 (phac1s) from pseudomonas chlororaphis, pseudomonas sp. 61-3, pseudomonas putida kt2440, pseudomonas resinovorans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 to accept short-chain-length hydroxyacyl-coas including lactyl-coa and 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa as substrates by site-directed mutagenesis of four sites (e130, s325, s477, and q481). all phac1s having mutations in these four sites were able to accept lactyl-coa as a substrate and supported the synthesis of p(3hb-co-la) in recombinant e. coli, whereas the wild-type phac1s could not accumulate polymers in detectable levels. the contents, lactate mole fractions, and the molecular weights of p(3hb-co-la) synthesized by recombinant e. coli varied depending upon  the source of the pha synthase and the mutants used. pla homopolymer could also be produced at ca. 7 wt.% by employing the several phac1 variants containing e130d/s325t/s477g/q481k quadruple mutations in wild-type e. coli xl1-blue.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
