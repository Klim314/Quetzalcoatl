TI  == recurrent infective endocarditis due to aggregatibacter aphrophilus and staphylococcus lugdunensis.
AB  == uncommon microorganisms are increasingly being recognized as causative agents of  paediatric infectious endocarditis (ie). we report a 4-year old girl with congenital heart disease, who suffered from 2 ie episodes secondary to aggregatibacter aphrophilus (formerly haemophilus aphrophilus) and staphylococcus lugdunensis, both rarely reported pathogens in this age group. the patient was initially successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses, however removal of the contegra valved conduit during the second episode was required due to recurrence of fever and development of pulmonary embolism despite completion of antibiotic therapy. a. aphrohilus is a member of the fastidious gram negative microorganisms of the hacek group (haemophilus spp., aggregatibacter spp, cardiobaterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella kingae), that colonize the oropharynx and are a recognised cause of ie. prognosis of children with ie due to hacek group members varies, half of them suffering from complications and mortality rates of 10-12.5%. although s. lugdunensis belongs to coagulase negative staphylococci (cons), it behaves more like s. aureus species rather than cons. this microorganism is a well-described cause of  endocarditis in adult patients, associated with high requirements of surgical procedures and mortality (42-78%). in conclusion, paediatric ie can be caused by  uncommon microorganisms associated with severe complications and potential fatality. the isolation of s. lugdunensis or a. aphrophilus in febrile patients should be considered clinically relevant and cardiac involvement must be ruled out. those patients with proved ie will require prolonged intravenous antibiotic  courses and in complicated cases surgical intervention.

TI  == [a case of osteomyelitis caused by mixed infection by aggregatibacter aphrophilus and staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == a 46-year-old man presented with a 10-day history of progressive weakness and numbness in both his legs. the spinal mri and abdominal ct revealed discitis of l4/l5 and multiple epidural abscesses. the blood culture tested positive for methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa). the gram stain of sample from abscess drainage showed gram-positive cocci in clusters and small gram-negative rods. the gram-positive cocci in clusters were identified as mssa using a general culture method and the small gram-negative rods were identified as aggregatibacter aphrophilus using a 16s ribosomal rna sequencing method. the patient was treated four times with surgical abscess drainages and a long course  of intravenous antibiotics therapy following which he recovered. no case of mixed infection by a. aphrophilus and s. aureus has been reported in medline; therefore, our case should be the first case report. since we confirmed not only  gram-positive cocci in clusters but also gram-negative rods in the abscess sample, we did not stop the identification procedure at the point when mssa was identified and finally identified a. aphrophilus with 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. especially, in a mixed infection with organisms whose growth speed is different, an organism with slow growth might be missed if the gram stain of sample were skipped. this case implies the significance of gram staining as the identification procedure for organisms.
