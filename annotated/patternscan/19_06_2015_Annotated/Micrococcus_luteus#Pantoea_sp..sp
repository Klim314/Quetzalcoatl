TI  == production and glucosylation of c50 and c 40 carotenoids by metabolically engineered corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  == the yellow-pigmented soil bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 is accumulating the cyclic c50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides. carotenoid pathway engineering was previously shown to allow for efficient lycopene production. here, engineering of c. glutamicum for production of endogenous decaprenoxanthin as well as of the heterologous c50 carotenoids c.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin is described. plasmid-borne overexpression of genes for lycopene cyclization and hydroxylation from c. glutamicum, dietzia sp., and micrococcus luteus, in a lycopene-producing platform strain constructed here, resulted in accumulation of these three c50 carotenoids to concentrations of about 3-4 mg/g cdw. chromosomal deletion of a putative carotenoid glycosyltransferase gene cg0730/crtx in these strains entailed production of non-glucosylated derivatives of decaprenoxanthin, c.p.450, and sarcinaxanthin, respectively. upon introduction of glucosyltransferase genes from m. luteus, c. glutamicum, and pantoea ananatis, these hydroxylated c50 carotenoids were glucosylated. we here also demonstrate production of the c40 carotenoids beta-carotene and zeaxanthin in recombinant c. glutamicum strains and co-expression of the p. ananatis crtx gene was used to obtain glucosylated zeaxanthin. together, our results show that c. glutamicum is a potentially valuable host for production of a wide range of glucosylated c40 and c50 carotenoids.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == culturable bacterial microbiota of plagiodera versicolora (l.) (coleoptera: chrysomelidae) and virulence of the isolated strains.
AB  == plagiodera versicolora (laicharting, 1781) (coleoptera: chrysomelidae) is an important forest pest which damages many trees such as willow, poplar, and hazelnut. in order to find new microbes that can be utilized as a possible microbial control agent against this pest, we investigated the culturable bacterial flora of it and tested the isolated bacteria against p. versicolora larvae and adults. we were able to isolate nine bacteria from larvae and adults.  the isolates were characterized using a combination of morphological, biochemical, and physiological methods. additionally, we sequenced the partial sequence of the 16s rrna gene to verify conventional identification results. based on characterization studies, the isolates were identified as staphylococcus sp. pv1, rahnella sp. pv2, rahnella sp. pv3, rahnella sp. pv4, rahnella sp. pv5,  pantoea agglomerans pv6, staphylococcus sp. pv7, micrococcus luteus pv8, and rahnella sp. pv9. the highest insecticidal activity against larvae and adults was obtained from m. luteus pv8 with 50 and 40 % mortalities within 10 days after treatment, respectively. extracellular enzyme activity of the bacterial isolates  such as amylase, proteinase, lipase, cellulose, and chitinase was also determined. consequently, our results show that m. luteus pv8 might be a good candidate as a possible microbial control agent against p. versicolora and were discussed with respect to biocontrol potential of the bacterial isolates.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.
