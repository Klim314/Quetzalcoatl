TI  - Microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  - The development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. This in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. Biofilms consisting of Actinomyces oris, Candida albicans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. After 64 h, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. After 96 h, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. At the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. Apart from C. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. Biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. Extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. Biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. This in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. Within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
TI  - Functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. The current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. Using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. METHODS: Metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and stable sites from periodontitis patients. Community-wide expression profiles were obtained using Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina). Sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. Differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented on the R package 'NOISeqBio'. We summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) orthology. RESULTS: Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid A and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. Periodontal pathogens (Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different TonB-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and CRISPR-associated genes. Surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, and Pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. We detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. Among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. CONCLUSIONS: We identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. Regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. Our results suggest that the whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an increase in virulence that leads to progression.

TI  - Periodontal Therapy Effects on Nitrite Related to Oral Bacteria: A 6-Month Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. Through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. This 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. METHODS: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-QS) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-FMS) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (CHX) (QS+CHX and FMS+CHX), placebo (QS+Placebo and FMS+Placebo), or no mouth rinse (QS+none and FMS+none) use. Real-time PCR determined total bacterial, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus oralis, and Actinomyces naeslundi levels. Salivary nitrite concentration was determined with Griess reagent. Data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. Regarding CHX use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (FMS+CHX) and one positive correlation between P.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (QS+CHX). Independently of rinse type, in the FMS group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. Short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term CHX use.
TI  - Association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in PCOS, compared to systemic health. A total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with PCOS and healthy periodontium, 35 women with PCOS and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically healthy women with gingivitis. Salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. In women with PCOS, salivary Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis and Tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women, particularly in the case of gingivitis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. The presence of PCOS also enhanced P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and S. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. Gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in PCOS. The presence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. In conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, PCOS may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. The most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on P. gingivalis.
TI  - Colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. This in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola). METHODS: The grown biofilm consisted of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella dispar, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, T. denticola, Actinomyces oris, Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". After 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected S. oralis, but not other species. The "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. A co-localisation trend was observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola, as determined by FISH. However, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially S. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSIONS: While the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. This antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. The model included Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomycesoris, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, Veillonella dispar, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola. Based on literature, we considered Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. We quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative PCR and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. The biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. However, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. In the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. Moreover, besides a significant increase of P. intermedia and a decrease of P. gingivalis , P. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. A. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. Hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on P. intermedia and P. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. Streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of P. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence P. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.
TI  - Validation of a quantitative real-time PCR assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. Owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. The aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts on selective agar plates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus anginosus, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Actinomyces oris, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. The numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qPCR, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of CFUs after growth on selective agar plates. RESULTS: All 10 species were successfully quantified using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of CFUs after growth on selective agar. In early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. In late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qPCR and FISH or immunofluorescence, but not by CFU counts, maintained significant correlation. CFU counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. However, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. This may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. The aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four Streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. The amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using universal and species-specific primers, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). Among obligate anaerobes, Tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and Eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. By contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). Specifically, the proportion of T. forsythia, P. gingivalis or E. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of Streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Obligate anaerobes, including T. forthysia, P. gingivalis and E. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas Streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. The proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Salivary microbiota of HIV-positive children and its correlation with HIV status, oral diseases, and total secretory IgA.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in HIV-positive children, and their correlation to HIV status, oral lesions, and salivary IgA levels. DESIGN: Forty-two HIV-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary IgA quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: The majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the HIV group. Mean concentration of total salivary IgA was similar in both groups. High levels of Veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis and herpes. Tannerella forsythia, Eikenella Corrodens, and Propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. Significant negative correlations between salivary IgA levels and Eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIV-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species in saliva; HIV-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; HIV-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  - Studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling methods. The purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and GCF samples using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. Plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. A total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (SD+/-4.7). On average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (SD+/-2.9). The proportion of Streptococcus oralis (P<0.02) and Fusobacterium periodonticum (P<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). The GCF samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (P-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). The proportions of Tannerella forsythia (T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola were both higher in GCF samples (P<0.02 and P<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). The microbial composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A combination of GCF and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.
