TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == use of essential oils and extracts from spices in meat protection.
AB  == the hydro distillation method was used in this study to get essential oils (eos)  from cumin (cuminum cyminum l.), clove (eugenia caryohyllata) and elecampane (inula helenium l.) and the co-hydro distillation method (addition of fatty acid  ethyl esters as extraction cosolvents) to get functional extracts (efs). the mic  (minimum inhibitory concentration) and the mbc (minimum bactericidal concentration) were determined on five pathogenic strains (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and toxoplasma gondi). the results showed that essential oils of cumin and clove and  their functional extracts are effective on concentrations from 500 mg/l to 750 mg/l. the essential oils with functional extracts were used on meat samples at three different concentrations: 750, 1,500 and 2,250 mul. the cumin essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 750 mul, the clove essential oil produced a reduction of 3.78 log ufc/g with the application of 2,250 mul and the cumin and clove functional extracts got a reduction of 3.6 log  ufc/g. by chromatography, eugenol was identified in the clove oil, cuminaldehyde  in the cumin oil and the isoalactolactones and alactolactones in the elecampane oil as main compounds on the chemical composition of the essential oils and functional extracts obtained.

TI  == evaluation of a multiplex pcr assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  == we evaluated a multiplex pcr assay, the seeplex diarrhoea ace detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including salmonella spp., shigella  spp., vibrio spp., toxin b producer clostridium difficile, campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli, adenovirus, group a rotavirus, norovirus gi and gii, and astrovirus. we compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens  in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. we recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. we calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex pcr than for our routine methods, with the exception of salmonella spp. and toxigenic c. difficile detection. the multiplex pcr assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.

TI  == disease-outcome trees, eq-5d scores, and estimated annual losses of quality-adjusted life years (qalys) for 14 foodborne pathogens in the united states.
AB  == measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. they provide a means of  comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. we present detailed disease-outcome trees and eq-5d scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the united states (campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, cryptosporidium parvum, cyclospora cayetanensis, escherichia coli o157:h7, shiga toxin-producing e. coli non-o157, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella, toxoplasma gondii, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera vibrio, and yersinia enterocolitica). we estimate over 5800 qalys lost per 1000 cases of l. monocytogenes and v. vulnificus, compared to 125 qalys lost per 1000 cases of t.  gondii, 26 for e. coli o157:h7, 16 for salmonella and campylobacter, and 14 for y. enterocolitica. the remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 qalys lost per 1000 cases. in total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in qaly loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total qaly loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. these estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research  is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. this study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == microbiological quality of blue mussels (mytilus edulis) in nunavik, quebec: a pilot study.
AB  == this pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in nunavik, quebec. one to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, escherichia coli, f-specific coliphages, clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing e. coli (particularly serovar o157:h7), shigella spp., and yersinia enterocolitica. in 5 communities, the presence of giardia duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. apart from small quantities of clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. toxoplasma gondii was also not detected.  however, g. duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. when considering the  indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.

TI  == presence of zoonotic pathogens in physico-chemically characterized manures from hog finishing houses using different production systems.
AB  == hog production has been intensified in eastern canada, by 50% over the last 20years. wastes are now managed with conventional production systems (slatted floor), litter systems or source separation systems. we studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus,  escherichia coli, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, giardia and cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. the concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. the source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. total and fecal coliforms, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system.campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions. zoonotic pathogens are therefore, found in the manure of eastern canadian hog finishing houses equipped  either with conventional, sawdust litter or source separation systems. pathogens  inactivation will require changes in manure management practices or the use of manure disinfection methods.

TI  == influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  == despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. we have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric h(+)/k(+)-atpase (proton pump) gene were infected with yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter rodentium, or clostridium perfringens cells or spores. significantly greater numbers of yersinia, salmonella, and citrobacter cells (p < or = 0.006) and clostridium spores (p = 0.02) survived in  hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. apart from establishing the role of  gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == microbiological baseline study of broiler chickens at swedish slaughterhouses.
AB  == this 1-year study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and concentrations of  pathogenic and indicator bacteria on swedish broiler chickens. a total of 636 chilled carcasses were collected from 10 slaughterhouses and sent to the national food administration for analyses of carcass rinses. no carcasses were positive for salmonella. campylobacter, predominantly campylobacter jejuni, were detected  on 15% (by enrichment) or 14% (by direct plating) of the carcasses. with one exception, all samples from late december through april were campylobacter negative. the 10th and 90th percentiles of campylobacter numbers per carcasses were 3.0 and 5.0 log cfu, respectively, and the maximum was 7.1 log cfu. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected on 68% of the carcasses, with a maximum of 3.5 log cfu/cm2. the 10th and 90th percentiles were 3.4 and 4.4 log cfu/cm2 for total aerobic microorganisms, 1.8 and 3.3 log cfu/cm2 for enterobacteriaceae, and 2.0 and 3.6 log cfu/cm2 for escherichia coli. no correlation was found between numbers of any indicator bacteria and numbers of pathogenic bacteria. subsets of the samples were analyzed for listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica, and enterococcus, resulting in prevalence estimates of 29, 18, 9 (as determined by a  pcr assay), and 97%, respectively. l. monocytogenes was most common at slaughterhouses with a low prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, and vice versa. these results will improve the ability of researchers to assess the importance of chicken as a source of foodborne pathogens and can serve as a basis for risk management actions.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == site-related airborne biological hazard and seasonal variations in two wastewater treatment plants.
AB  == results of a study conducted to assess the degree of airborne bacterial contamination generated by two wastewater treatment plants (wwtp) with different  treatment systems and evaluate the dispersion of potential pathogens, have been described. aerosols samples were collected in summer and winter with an agar impact sampler from several plant sites. external upwind and downwind controls were also examined. total colony-forming counts of mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria, actinomycetes and streptomycetes, gram-negatives, coliforms and sulfite-reducers were determined. selective media were used in order to detect pathogenic bacteria. the lowest concentrations of mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria were 8 and 28 cfu/m(3) in plants a and b respectively, the highest >40,000 cfu/m(3) in both plants. strains of escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. were isolated in some sites of the two plants. salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica and legionella  spp. were never detected. the activities involving nebulization and mechanical aeration of wastewaters and the sewage inflows have proved to be of greatest potential risk. in both plants, we found a statistically significant dependence of bacterial contamination on the season for many of the analyzed parameters but  a clear seasonal trend could not be observed.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == duplex real-time sybr green pcr assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  == a duplex real-time sybr green lightcycler pcr (lc-pcr) assay with dna extraction  using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or  less. the protocol used the same lc-pcr with 20 pairs of specific primers. the products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (t(m)) curve analysis. the 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus, aeromonas spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and bacillus cereus. no interference with the lc-pcr assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. the detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of  stool. the protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. however, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in johannesburg, south africa.
AB  == fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in johannesburg, south africa. food temperatures  were recorded at the time of sampling. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (apcs), spore counts (scs), and enterobacteriaceae counts (ecs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (ccs) for water and swab samples. in addition, petrifilm escherichia coli count (pc) plates were used for  the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. the presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic e. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. predominant colonies isolated from apc plates were characterized to the genus level. holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees c, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees c. mean apc values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log cfu/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. mean sc values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log cfu/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. a mean ec value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g for food samples and mean cc values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/ml and 1.3  (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. mean pc values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log cfu/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log cfu/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, clostridium perfringens in 16%, salmonella spp. in 2%, and e. coli (non-o157:h+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. e. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  vibrio cholerae, and yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. the 340 isolates obtained from apc plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly bacillus spp., micrococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. it was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

AB  == a case control study of foal diarrhoea in the united kingdom was carried out over a 3-year period. clostridium perfringens was significantly associated with foal diarrhoea (odds ratio (or) = 3.0), being isolated from 57% of 421 animals with diarrhoea but from only 27% of 223 healthy foals. also, c. perfringens was significantly associated with fatal diarrhoea (or = 4.5). about half of diarrhoea with a fatal outcome was attributable to this organism. the other pathogens significantly associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (or = 5.6), cryptosporidium spp. (or = 3.2) and the nematode strongyloides westeri, which was significant only when present in large numbers (> 2000 eggs/g of faeces: or = 6.1). salmonella spp. (or = 14.2) and cryptosporidium spp. (or = 3.0) were the only other pathogens associated with fatal illness. overall, c. perfringens, rotavirus, and large numbers of cryptosporidium spp. or s. westeri were isolated  from 80% of foals with diarrhoea. thermophilic campylobacter spp., yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli and other parasites were not associated with diarrhoea. carriage of c. perfringens, rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp. was significantly greater in healthy foals in contact with cases of diarrhoea than in foals that were not in contact with diarrhoea (p < 0.05). there were no statistical interactions between any of the pathogens associated with diarrhoea although separate cases from one location often involved more than one pathogen.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == a study of the bacterial and parasitic causes of acute diarrhoea in northern jordan.
AB  == the prevalence of bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents in 200 patients suffering from acute diarrhoea and reporting to hospitals and health centres in northern jordan, and in controls was determined. one or more bacterial or parasitic enteropathogens was isolated from 79 patients (39.5%). prevalence rates for these pathogens was as follows: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, 9%; enteropathogenic e. coli, 9%; salmonella spp. 7%; campylobacter spp, 5.5%; yersinia enterocolitica, 4.5%; shigella spp, 4%; aeromonas spp, 3.5%; enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens, 2%; vibrio spp, 2%; and plesiomonas shigelloides, 0.5%. both giardia lamblia and entamoeba histolytica were detected  in 2% of the stool samples examined. although the determination of the aetiologic role of the identified enteropathogens was complicated by more than one factor, the data collected will serve as a baseline for future studies of the subject.

TI  == the prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic thoroughbred foals in britain and ireland.
AB  == a survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in britain and ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of group a rotaviruses and aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. the prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and clostridium  perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. rotaviruses had a similar  prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. the number of cases of  diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. a comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (em) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) to have similar sensitivity. the rotazyme elisa test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of em and page. a. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. a. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. no evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic  e. coli. neither coccidia nor non-group a rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.

AB  == a study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a united states military population on deployment in cairo, egypt, during july and august 1987. acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. a possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (17% st-producers, 13% lt-producers, and 3% lt/st-producers); shigella (9%); campylobacter spp. (2%); salmonella (2%); and vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included aeromonas hydrophila group, plesiomonas shigelloides, and bacillus cereus. yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive e. coli, intoxications by clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not  found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. a survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel deployed to egypt.

TI  == [value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  == reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni/coli, shigella and salmonella. intestinal infections with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, cryptosporidium, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia saginata and schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis.  detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. a large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. it is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. the detection of serum antibodies  to y. enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis, c. jejuni/coli, and schistosoma may  suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.

AB  == the antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system was studied on food-poisoning organisms including staphylococcus aureus, salmonella infantis, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica using automated turbidometry. the bacteria were grown in sterile-filtered meat medium which was either raw or heat-denaturated. the results showed a clear growth inhibition with combinations  of 0.5-1.0 mg/ml glucose and 0.5-1.0 iu/ml glucose oxidase. the growth inhibition was more effective in the heat-denaturated meat medium. the most resistant pathogens were campylobacter jejuni and listeria monocytogenes, however growth inhibition was still evident. the possible application of the glucose oxidase-glucose system in food products inhibiting the growth of pathogens and spoilage organisms is discussed.

AB  == the flora of the large intestine of 92 grey herons was examined for the frequency of aerobic and microaerobic growing bacteria. clostridium perfringens, aeromonas  hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides and e. coli were isolated from 55%, 48%, 14% and 35% of the birds, respectively. it could be demonstrated that the findings of these bacteria in the intestinal flora are depending on the age of the birds. the percentage of carriers of clostridium perfringens, aeromonas hydrophila and plesiomonas shigelloides was highest in nestlings younger than 18 days, less high in older nestlings and lowest in adult grey herons. contrary to those bacteria, e. coli was found more often in the intestinal flora at increasing age of the birds. salmonella spp. were isolated from 6 birds. two birds yielded positive for yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter spp., respectively. other aerobic and microaerobic bacteria play a less significant role as part of the intestinal flora.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.

AB  == one hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in shimane prefecture, japan, were examined for the presence of salmonella sp. (sal), campylobacter jejuni (cj), campylobacter coli (cc), yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and clostridium perfringens (cp) from april 1984 to march 1985. a total of 205 isolates of sal (112 strains), cj (64 strains), cc (one strain), ye (7 strains) and cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, cc in 0.8% of pork, ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. these enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially sal and cj. sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, cp  was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and cc from pork and cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. this investigation showed that a second-contamination of sal  and cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. it was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with  plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially sal and cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with ye during the cold months.

TI  == prevalence of various enteropathogens in the feces of diarrheic and healthy calves.
AB  == the presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of france (north west of county of indre-et-loire) during winter 1983-1984. two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves  in another farm. the following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: escherichia coli k99 and e. coli lethal for mice, salmonella species, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens, chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, cryptosporidium. in the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic e. coli (k99+) was detected in either group of calves. four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal e. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). one at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (p less than  0.01). on the other hand, the occurrence of campylobacter jejuni and of c. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; p less than 0.05). in the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic e. coli. but each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. in addition, specific antibodies against c. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an elisa test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. this study confirms the primary role  of rotavirus and cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. it also suggests the possible participation of e. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic c. perfringens.

TI  == [epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. about one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. among the viral  infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear  to occur worldwide. enteropathogenic (epec) and, especially, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. yersinia enterocolitica is rare in  tropical countries. cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (v. cholerae non-01, v. mimicus, v. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. clostridium perfringens type c is the causal agent of enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially new guinea. c. difficile appears to be of minor importance. among the parasites giardia lamblia  and entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella  and e. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.

AB  == in a 12-month survey (june 1982-may 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. the statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees c and by  76% at 22 degrees c. there were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 escherichia coli per ml in 91%. staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of yersinia enterocolitica. salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. the methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. no sample was brucella ring-test-positive. experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored  goat's milk showed that bacillus cereus, staph. aureus, salmonella typhimurium and y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees c. clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while campylobacter jejuni did not grow. the results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

AB  == one hundred and eighty-two raw, 112 pre-cooked and 750 cooked hamburgers composed mainly of beef or beef and pork were subjected to microbiological examination.raw hamburgers gave total bacterial counts from 10(6) to 10(8) per g, counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(4) to 10(6) per g, of escherichia coli from 10(3) to 10(5), of group d streptococci from 10(2) to 10(4), of staphylococcus aureus from 3 to 10(2) and of clostridium perfringens less than 10 bacteria per g. of the samples, 32% contained salmonellas; the highest most probable number was 10(2) per g but most estimates were below 1 per g. corresponding figures for the pre-cooked samples were 2-3 log cycles lower, and only one sample contained salmonella. yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any raw or pre-cooked sample.three hundred and ninety-five of the cooked hamburgers were prepared by grilling raw hamburgers for between 2 and 5.5 min. these gave total bacterial counts from 10(5) to 10(7) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae from 10(2) to  10(5) per g. of the samples, 9.4% contained salmonellas, always in numbers below  1 per g. the remaining 355 cooked hamburgers were prepared from samples pre-cooked for 10 min at 80 degrees c. some were grilled and some fat fried. the  total bacterial counts were from 10(3) to 10(5) per g, and counts of enterobacteriaceae below 10(2) per g. salmonellae, again in small numbers only, were recovered from 3.5% of samples.when hamburgers were artificially contaminated with salmonella typhimurium it took 5.5 min on a commercial grill, 2.25 min frying in a frying pan and 1.75 min on a household grill to reliably reduce the salmonella count one hundredfold. this means that at many vending places hamburgers are often cooked for too short a time.d-values were determined  for s. typhimurium in hamburger meat at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 degrees c, these values were 7.1, 5.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 min respectively. it can be concluded that the heating action in the centre of the hamburgers will take place more slowly than in the hamburger as a whole, and that the time between cooking and consumption is very important in reducing the microbial load to acceptable levels.pre-cooking (10 min at 80 degrees c in a water bath) gives a reduction in  the numbers of salmonella of about 4 x 10(3), after which cooking gives a further reduction as mentioned above.
