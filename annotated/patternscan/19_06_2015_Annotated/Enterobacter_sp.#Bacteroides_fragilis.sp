TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == the in vitro activity of the combination of cefotaxime and hre 664.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx) and hre 664 (a novel penem antibiotic) possess complementary in  vitro properties. differences can be observed in their antibacterial spectra, their beta-lactamase stability and -inhibition, and their affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. these differences suggested that combinations of the cephalosporin and the penem antibiotic would be advantageous and should be studied. the fractional inhibitory concentration values of checkerboard studies confirmed that ctx and hre 664 act synergistically against various gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. fixed combinations containing 80% ctx and 20% hre 664 possess broader antibacterial spectra and in certain cases higher antibacterial activities than each of the components alone. the combinations had improved activity against staphylococci including methicillin-resistant strains, beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the combination as well as the single antibiotics had only limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == [effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cutaneous abscesses in children.
AB  == specimens from 209 cutaneous abscesses in children were cultured for aerobic and  anaerobic microorganisms. of these, nine (4%) were sterile and 51 (24%) yielded pure cultures that were predominantly staphylococcus aureus. the rest of the abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. the data were organized according to these anatomic locations: head, neck, trunk, finger, nailbed, hand, leg, buttocks, perirectal, and vulvovaginal areas. aerobic bacteria only were present in 92 specimens (46%), anaerobes only were isolated in 52 (26%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 56 abscesses (28%). a total of 467 isolates (270 anaerobes and 197 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.3 anaerobes and 1.0 aerobes). the presence of more than one anaerobe per abscess was obtained from the vulvo-vaginal, buttocks, perirectal, finger, nailbed, and head areas. aerobes were more prevalent in the neck, hand, leg, and trunk areas. the predominant aerobes recovered were: s aureus (89 isolates), alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci (29), group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (16), enterobacter (10), and escherichia coli (8). the predominant anaerobes recovered were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (79 isolates), bacteroides sp (116, including 31 b melaninogenicus group and 29 b fragilis group), and fusobacterium sp (39). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cutaneous abscesses in children in perirectal, head, finger, and nailbed areas.

TI  == cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. the antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as staphylococcus aureus. other pathogens included streptococcus epidermidis, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as bacteroides fragilis. the drug was well tolerated. pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == the activity of ly127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. ly127935 exhibited striking activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., proteus sp., serratia marcescens, and b. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was somewhat less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. cefotaxime (hr 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against b. fragilis. ly127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
