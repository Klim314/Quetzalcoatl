TI  == eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human blood.
AB  == a catalase-positive, rod-shaped, non-proteolytic, non-motile, anaerobic bacterial strain, designated b086562(t), was isolated from a blood culture of an 84-year-old male patient in israel. according to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogeny, this strain has no known close relatives among recognized bacteria but should be placed within the family lachnospiraceae. the most closely related recognized bacteria were from the 'clostridium clostridioforme group': c. clostridioforme (92.4%) and clostridium bolteae (92.3%). the isolate produced butyrate, lactate, acetate and succinate as major metabolic end products. the major fatty acids were c16:0 and c18:1 cis 9 dma and the dna g+c content was 46.0 mol%. on the basis of the phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, the blood isolate represents a novel species of a new genus in the family lachnospiraceae, for which the name eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of eisenbergiella tayi is b086562(t) ( = lmg 27400(t) = dsm 26961(t) = atcc baa-2558(t)).

TI  == fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == three gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, spindle-shaped bacterial strains (ht03-11(t), ko-38 and tt-111), isolated from human faeces were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the strains were highly related  to each other genetically (displaying >99 % sequence similarity) and represented  a previously unknown subline within the blautia coccoides rrna group of organisms (cluster xiva). the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain ht03-11(t) were clostridium bolteae wal 16351(t) (93.7 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and clostridium saccharolyticum wm1(t) (93.7 % similarity). all isolates produced lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid as fermentation end products from glucose. their chemotaxonomic properties included lysine as the cell wall diamino acid and c16 : 0, c18 : 1omega7c dma and c16 : 0 dma as the major fatty acids. the g+c contents of the genomic dna were 46.9-47.2 mol% (hplc). several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics could be readily used to differentiate the isolates from phylogenetically related clostridia. therefore, strains ht03-11(t), ko-38 and tt-111 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family lachnospiraceae, for which the name fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of the type species is ht03-11(t) ( = yit 12554(t) = jcm 18507(t) = dsm 26062(t)).

TI  == diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (lama pacos) and sheep (ovis aries).
AB  == two bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. after the amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers, equal quantities of pcr products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. sequence analysis showed that the  60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with eubacterium sp. f1. the 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). clones closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, eubacterium sp. f1, clostridium cellobioparum, mogibacterium neglectum, eubacterium ventriosum, clostridiaceae bacterium wn011, clostridium coccoides, clostridium orbiscindens, eubacterium sp. f1, cytophaga sp. dex80-37, treponema bryantii and pelotomaculum sp. fp were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to anaerovorax odorimutans, treponema zioleckii, bifidobacterium indicum, paludibacter propionicigenes, paraprevotella clara, eubacterium siraeum, desulfotomaculum sp. cyp1, clostridium bolteae, clostridium termitidis and clostridiaceae bacterium djf_ls40 only in the rumen of sheep. quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16s rrna gene copies (6.89 [log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71,  p<0.01). the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.

TI  == clostridium lavalense sp. nov., a glycopeptide-resistant species isolated from human faeces.
AB  == two vancomycin-resistant, strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms (strains ccri-9842(t) and ccri-9929) isolated from human  faecal specimens in quebec, canada, and australia were characterized using phenotypic, biochemical and molecular taxonomic methods. pairwise analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences showed that both strains were closely related to each other genetically (displaying 99.2 % sequence similarity) and represented a previously unknown subline within the clostridium coccoides rrna group of organisms (rrna cluster xiva of the genus clostridium). strains ccri-9842(t) and  ccri-9929 used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid as  the major product of glucose metabolism. the novel strains were most closely related to clostridium asparagiforme, clostridium bolteae and clostridium clostridioforme, but morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic studies demonstrated that they represent a previously unidentified species of the genus clostridium. this was confirmed by the unique cellular fatty acid composition of  strains ccri-9842(t) and ccri-9929. therefore, on the basis of data from the polyphasic taxonomic analysis, it is proposed that strains ccri-9842(t) and ccri-9929 represent a novel species of the genus clostridium, for which the name  clostridium lavalense sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is ccri-9842(t) (=ccug 54291(t)=jcm 14986(t)=nml 03-a-015(t)).

TI  == moryella indoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == three gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria with pointed ends were isolated from clinical specimens. the organisms were weakly saccharolytic and produced indole, acetate, butyrate and lactate as major metabolic end products. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolates had no known close relatives among recognized bacteria but that they exhibited a phylogenetic association with clostridium rrna cluster xiva [as defined by collins, m. d. et al. (1994). int j syst bacteriol 44, 812-826]. the closest recognized relatives were the type strains of clostridium clostridioforme, clostridium bolteae and clostridium asparagiforme (16s rrna gene sequence similarity values of 90.2-91.4 %). these results suggest that these three clinical isolates represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name moryella indoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of moryella indoligenes is aip 220.04(t) (=cip 109174(t)=ccug 52648(t)).

TI  == clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. isolated from human clinical infections.
AB  == one hundred eight isolates were previously identified in our laboratory as clostridium clostridioforme by colonial and cellular morphology, as well as biochemical tests. recent studies have indicated that there are actually three different species in this c. clostridioforme group: c. hathewayi, c. bolteae, and c. clostridioforme. our isolates were reexamined using biochemical and enzymatic  tests and molecular methods. forty-six isolates were reidentified as c. hathewayi, 34 as c. bolteae, five as c. clostridioforme, and one as c. symbiosum. twenty-two strains were identified only to the genus level by 16s rrna gene sequencing, and although they are microscopically and morphologically indistinguishable from the above-mentioned three species, they are phenotypically different and only 96 to 98% similar by gene sequencing. twenty of these 22 strains were indole positive and formed two novel species. we propose clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and clostridium citroniae sp. nov. as names for these new species. they are differentiated from each other by results for raffinose, rhamnose, alpha-galactosidase, and beta-galactosidase: positive, negative, positive, and positive, respectively, for the former species and negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively, for the latter species. the type  strain of c. aldenense is rma 9741 (atcc baa-1318; ccug 52204), and the type strain of c. citroniae is rma 16102 (atcc baa-1317; ccug 52203).

TI  == clostridium asparagiforme sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  == an obligatory anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped organism was isolated from faeces of a healthy human donor. it was characterized using biochemical, phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the organism produced acetate, lactate, and ethanol as the major products of glucose fermentation. the g + c content was 53 mol%. based on comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing, the unidentified bacterium is a member of the clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria, and most closely related to species of the clostridium coccoides cluster (rrna cluster xiva) [m.d. collins et al., the phylogeny of the  genus clostridium: proposal of five new genera and eleven new species combinations, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44 (1994) 812-826]. clostridium bolteae and clostridium clostridioforme were identified as the most closely related described species. a 16s rrna sequence divergence value of > 3% suggested that the isolate represents a new species. this was also supported by the gyrase-encoding gyrb gene sequences. based on these findings, we propose the novel bacterium from human faeces to be classified as a new species, clostridium  asparagiforme. the type strain of c. asparagiforme is n6 (dsm 15981 and ccug 48471).

TI  == clostridium bolteae sp. nov., isolated from human sources.
AB  == seven obligately anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms isolated from human sources were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the strains were genetically highly related to each other (displaying >99% sequence similarity) and represent a previously unknown sub-line within the clostridium coccoides rrna group of organisms. strains of the unidentified bacterium used carbohydrate as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid and lactic acid as  the major products of glucose metabolism. the closest described species to the novel bacterium corresponded to clostridium clostridioforme, although a 16s rrna  sequence divergence of 3% demonstrated they represent different species. genomic  dna-dna pairing studies confirmed the separateness of the unknown species and clostridium clostridioforme. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is therefore proposed that the unknown bacterium, be classified as clostridium bolteae sp. nov. the type strain of clostridium bolteae is wal 16351t (= atcc(t)  = baa-613t, ccug(t) = 46953t).
