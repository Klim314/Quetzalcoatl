TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == understanding how commensal obligate anaerobic bacteria regulate immune functions in the large intestine.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract is colonised by trillions of commensal bacteria, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the large intestine. appropriate bacterial colonisation is generally known to be critical for human health. in particular, the development and function of the immune system depends on microbial colonisation, and a regulated cross-talk between commensal bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells is required to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis. this homeostasis is disturbed in various inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a role for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, akkermansia muciniphila and segmented filamentous bacteria in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. these obligate anaerobes are abundant in the healthy intestine but reduced in several inflammatory diseases, suggesting an association with protective effects on human health. however, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effects of obligate anaerobic intestinal bacteria remains limited, in part due to the difficulty of co-culturing obligate anaerobes together with oxygen-requiring human epithelial cells. by using novel dual-environment co-culture models, it will be possible to  investigate the effects of the unstudied majority of intestinal microorganisms on the human epithelia. this knowledge will provide opportunities for improving human health and reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.

TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == xylo-oligosaccharides and inulin affect genotoxicity and bacterial populations differently in a human colonic simulator challenged with soy protein.
AB  == high dietary intakes of some protein sources, including soy protein, can increase colonic dna damage in animals, whereas some carbohydrates attenuate this. we investigated whether inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) could be protective against dna strand breaks by adding them to a human colonic simulator consisting  of a proximal vessel (pv) (ph 5.5) and a distal vessel (dv) (ph 6.8) inoculated with human faeces and media containing soy protein. genotoxicity of the liquid phase and microbial population changes in the vessels were measured. soy protein  (3%) was fermented with 1% low amylose cornstarch for 10 day followed by soy protein with 1% xos or 1% inulin for 10 day. inulin did not alter genotoxicity but xos significantly reduced pv genotoxicity and increased dv genotoxicity. inulin and xos significantly increased butyrate concentration in the dv but not pv. numbers of the key butyrate-producing bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly increased in the pv and dv by inulin but significantly decreased by xos in both vessels. other bacteria examined were also significantly impacted by the carbohydrate treatments or by the vessel (i.e., ph). there was a  significant overall inverse correlation between levels of damage induced by the ferments and levels of sulphate-reducing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis, and acetate. in conclusion, dietary xos can potentially modulate the genotoxicity of  the colonic environment and specific bacterial groups and short chain fatty acids may mediate this.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == influence of bifidobacterium longum bb536 intake on faecal microbiota in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis during the pollen season.
AB  == it has been reported that intake of yogurt or powder supplemented with the bifidobacterium longum bb536 probiotic strain alleviated subjective symptoms and  affected blood markers of allergy in individuals with japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) during the pollen seasons of 2004 and 2005, based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. furthermore, the 2004 study found that intestinal bacteria such as the bacteroides fragilis group significantly fluctuated during the pollen season in jcpsis individuals and intake of bb536 yogurt tended to suppress these fluctuations. the present study investigated faecal microbiota to examine whether any changes occurred during the pollen season and whether any influence was exerted by intake of bb536 powder in the 2005 pollen season, which happened to be a heavy season, to confirm the 2004 findings and to evaluate the relationship of microbiota with symptom development. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 44 jcpsis subjects received bb536 or a placebo for 13 weeks during the pollen season. another 14 japanese cedar pollen (jcp)-specific ige negative healthy subjects received placebo for the same period. faecal samples were collected before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 13) and after (week 17) intervention, and out of jcp season (week 28). faecal microbiota were analysed using terminal-rflp (t-rflp) and real-time pcr methods. principal component analysis based on t-rflp indicated distinct patterns of microbiota between healthy subjects and jcpsis subjects in the placebo group, but an intermediate pattern in the bb536 group at week 13, the last stage of the pollen season. the coordinate of principal component 1 at week  13 correlated with composite scores of jcpsis symptoms recorded during the pollen season. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the bacteroides fragilis group were identified as the main contributors to microbiotal fluctuations. real-time pcr indicated that bb536 intake suppressed increases in the bacteroides fragilis group compared with the placebo group (p <0.05). these results suggest that faecal microbiota in jcpsis subjects, but not healthy subjects, fluctuate at the  end of the pollen season and that bb536 intake plays a role in maintaining normal microbiota.

TI  == high proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (uc) remains unknown. it is thought to be  due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. the aim of this study was to investigate the colonic  microbiota of a patient with uc. the colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from uc. the microbiota on the colonic samples  was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna genes. compared with  healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the  uc patient. we found a high incidence of enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "butyrate-producing bacterium" l2-6. furthermore, there was a substantial presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of uc. the high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with  more normal situations. even if those bacteria are not the cause of the uc, they  most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.
