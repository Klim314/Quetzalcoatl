TI  - Species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. Increasing resistance to penicillin in VGS is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. We investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various VGS species. METHODS: In total 1,448 VGS isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a two-yr period. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, France) or the MicroScan MICroSTREP system (Siemens, Germany). RESULTS: Among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). Streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the S. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%), S. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and S. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). In total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. The overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in S. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in S. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in S. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in S. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various VGS; this should be considered while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against VGS.
TI  - Parallel evolution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  - The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. Intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal Streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. In a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from S. mitis to S. pneumoniae. Import of genes from S. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae. Our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. While genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. Importance: One of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal Streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. Faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. We have shown that the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports genes from S. mitis and other related streptococci. This process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the bacterial genus Streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  - Members of the genus Streptococcus within the phylum Firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. This genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic approaches, DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". However, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. We use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of Streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. Genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. Population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including Pyogenic, Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups, and the other including Mitis, Anginosus and Unknown groups. Phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. Distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. We suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.
TI  - The influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfP, on biofilm formation by  Streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. In vitro, S. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. The present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by S. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. Inactivation of the gtfP gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the S. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type S. sanguinis, but not the gtfP-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence of 1% (w/v) sucrose. In addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. By contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. oralis, S. gordonii, S. anginosus, or S. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfP gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. Furthermore, inactivating the gtfP gene did not greatly alter the proportion of S. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. Thus, despite the role of S. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.
TI  - Effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  - AIM: Recent UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (IE), and advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. As viridans group streptococci (VGS) are common etiological agents of IE and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of VGS organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). METHODS: The survival of VGS, Streptococcus gordonii (National Collection of Type Cultures [NCTC] 7865), Streptococcus intermedius (NCTC 11324), Streptococcus mutans (NCTC 10449), Streptococcus oralis (NCTC 11427), Streptococcus pneumoniae (NCTC 7465, NCTC 7978, & American Type Culture Collection 49619) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTC 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. RESULTS: No organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill VGS organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of IE.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral Streptococci.
AB  - Filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. They inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. Beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death rates at the cellular level. In order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. oralis and S. anginosus. The results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. The filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. Hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. Moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these species.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group Streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  - The development of high-level daptomycin resistance (HLDR; MIC of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (VGS) isolates. Our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of HLDR after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of VGS and Streptococcus bovis; to determine whether HLDR also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain S. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of HLDR in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies were performed with 114 VGS strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 Streptococcus bovis strains isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. HLDR was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of S. mitis isolates, 47% of S. oralis isolates, and 13% of S. sanguis isolates. In our experimental model, HLDR was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. In vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against S. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the MIC and prevented the development of HLDR. In vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented HLDR in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. Daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. In conclusion, HLDR develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. Combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of HLDR in most cases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various antibiotics against oral streptococci isolated  in the oral cavity.
AB  - A total of 550 oral streptococci: 270 Streptococcus mitis, 110 Streptococcus sanguis, 90 Streptococcus anginosus, 50 Streptococcus mutans, 30 Streptococcus salivarius, were isolated from dental plaque and gengival crevices of patients and tested for their susceptibility to 12 beta-lactam antibiotics and to 5 non-beta-lactam antibiotics, using the microdiluition method. Overall, a reduced susceptibility to penicillin was recorded in 13.4% of cases. The percentage of strains resistant to penicillin appeared significantly higher in S. mitis (24%) than in S. sanguis (19%), in S. mutans (14%) and in S. salivarius (10%). No levels of penicillin resistance were shown by 90 strains of S. anginosus. In susceptibility test to antibiotics, imipenem was the most active molecule tested, confirming its general good activity against oral streptococci. Also third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and fourth generation cephalosporins such as cefepime, showed good activity. Chinolones, glycopeptides and rifampicin confirmed a good activity against oral streptococci.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - A feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-B from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. S. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (GTFs). One of these, GTF-B, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. Therefore, determination of whether GTF-B is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). The aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the routine quantification of GTF-B in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples, and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. To determine the presence of GTF-B in plaque samples, a sandwich-ELISA was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GTF-B and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The developed ELISA allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified GTF-B with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and saliva. Plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this ELISA method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. A correlation was observed between the amount of extracted GTF-B and S. mutans levels as determined by ELISA and cultivated with Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. In this regard, this ELISA system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of S. mutans and the productivity of GTF-B, namely, the cariogenic potential of S. mutans simultaneously. These results indicate that this ELISA method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  - The oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. The oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. Glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. The 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by VITEK system using gram-positive identification cards. Species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for PCR identification of isolates. Sequencing of 16S rRNA was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. VITEK system identified a number of 11 strains as S. mitis/oralis, 12 strains as S. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as S. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3 strains as S. salivarius, 3 strains as S. plurianimalium, 1 strain as S. cristatus and 1 strain as S. alactolyticus, respectively. The PCR system targeting gtf genes was able to identify S. oralis, S. salivarius and S. gordonii strains. Sequence of 16S rRNA discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. Their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.
TI  - Invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  - Oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. Atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded HAECs. The invasion of HAECs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin D on the invasion of HAECs were also examined. The production of cytokines by invaded or infected HAECs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger RNA. The oral streptococci tested were capable of invading HAECs. The number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. After a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the HAECs. Catalase and cytochalasin D inhibited the invasion of HAECs by the organism. HAECs invaded by Streptococcus mutans Xc, Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis), Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558 and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded HAECs. The HAECs invaded by S. mutans Xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger RNA expression of cytokines by invaded HAECs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded HAECs. These results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Identification of oral bacteria by 16S rRNA gene analysis in elderly persons requiring nursing care.
AB  - After incubation of saliva from 58 semi-bedridden elderly persons, the cultures were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene base sequence to compare the identification by the conventional culture method. As a result, the 16S rRNA gene base sequence of 198 strains identified by the culture method showed 98.5% or more homology in some of the Human Oral Microbiome database, and the identification of bacterial species and genus was possible. When an organism identified by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method was compared with that by the culture method, the concordance rates were 54.5% at the genus level and 35.9% at the species level. Streptococcus mitis strains most frequently isolated from saliva that were identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method (32/35), and all the 11 Streptococcus salivarius strains identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. All the strains identified as Streptococcus anginosus group by the culture method and 8 of the 9 strains identified as Prevotella species by the culture method were identified as the same group and genus by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. When an oral microbial flora test with saliva samples from elderly persons is performed, the 16S rRNA gene sequence identification enables us to identify major indigenous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria and is considered useful as a means of supplementing the conventional culture method.
TI  - [Classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. They reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. They can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. The diagnosis of VGS are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. Viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (Sanguinis, Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius, Anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA sequencing. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. Genetic exchange between Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. These mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. The cultivation of VGS usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. Observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. VGS are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. The last step in the laboratory diagnosis of VGS is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. In this review article, classification of VGS, similarities between S.pneumoniae and Mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of VGS have been discussed.
TI  - Contribution towards developing a new semi-selective medium for Streptococcus anginosus group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a new selective medium for isolation of Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) strains, by adding sulphamethazine and aztreonam as selective agents at Mitis-Salivarius agar (MSA), the medium commonly used for recovery of oral streptococci from oral samples. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The evaluation of Mitis-Salivarius--sulphamethazine--aztreonam agar (MSSAA) for SAG selectivity was performed by testing the growth of type strains and laboratory-stored clinical isolates of different oral streptococcal species on this medium and also by investigating the SAG recovery on MSSAA in comparison with MSA and the growth inhibition of non-SAG strains from 100 saliva and 11 pus samples (collected from healthy young subjects and from paediatric patients with upper respiratory tract infections, respectively) on MSSAA. RESULTS: The same SAG recovery rate was obtained on both MSSAA and MSA, while non-SAG strains failed to grow on the novel medium, except for enterococci. The results of the present study have indicated that MSSAA is a suitable medium for selecting SAG isolates from clinical specimens.
TI  - Infective Endocarditis: Identification of Catalase-Negative, Gram-Positive Cocci  from Blood Cultures by Partial 16S rRNA Gene Analysis and by Vitek 2 Examination.
AB  - Streptococci, enterococci and Streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. Viridans streptococci (VS) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. Vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. STRAINS ORIGINATED FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. Of the 330 strains, based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were VS strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were E. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci. Among VS strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same VS group. Non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.Only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. Most VS strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. Pyogenic strains (n=10), Enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16S rRNA-encoding, recA, secA, and secY gene sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. Two of these species, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, Streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. Given that S. salivarius and S. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to S. thermophilus. However, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that S. vestibularis is more closely related to S. thermophilus. To determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from secA and secY, the general secretion housekeeping genes, recA, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. RESULTS: The maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic inferences derived from the secA and recA gene sequences provided strong support for the S. vestibularis/S. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16S rRNA-encoding and secY-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. Phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSION: Our results corroborated the sister-relationship between S. vestibularis and S. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of S. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(B) and mef(A)] in Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within CF airways has not yet been examined. We therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. METHODS: Erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (VGS) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and VGS [n = 84; i.e. Streptococcus salivarius (n = 30), Streptococcus mitis (n = 17), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), Streptococcus oralis (n = 10), Streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), Streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), Streptococcus infantis (n = 3), Streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), Streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and Streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult CF patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous 7 months. RESULTS: Almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. The majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(A) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(E) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(B) and mef(E) genes simultaneously in 11/99 (11.1%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with azithromycin in CF patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal VGS, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  - The ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. In this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus salivarius. Non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. When both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (PYG) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA), respectively, was absent in both species. However, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by LIVE/DEAD staining. Metabolic reactivation of the nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh PYG medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. At 72 h, the S. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. With L. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. Reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from PYG, and S. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (YE) medium. The data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Rapid identification of viridans streptococci by mass spectrometric discrimination.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are responsible for several systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septicemia. Unfortunately, species identification by conventional methods seems to be more difficult than species identification of other groups of bacteria. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the rapid identification of 10 different species of VS. A total of 99 VS clinical isolates, 10 reference strains, and 20 strains from our in-house culture collection were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. To evaluate the mass-spectrometric discrimination results, all strains were identified in parallel by phenotypic and genotypic methods. MALDI-TOF-MS identified 71 isolates as the mitis group, 23 as the anginosus group, and 5 as Streptococcus salivarius. Comparison of the species identification results obtained by the MALDI-TOF-MS analyses and with the phenotypic/genotypic identification systems showed 100% consistency at the species level. Thus, MALDI-TOF-MS seems to be a rapid and reliable method for the identification of species of VS from clinical samples.
TI  - Tigecycline (GAR-936) activity against Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci including Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. Tigecycline (GAR-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. The studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and fewer strains of S. gallolyticus (98 strains) and Streptococcus mutans (50 strains). These strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/mL for tigecycline per US Food and Drug Administration). Penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (S. sanguis) to 98% (S. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). Tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for S. gallolyticus. In conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and S. gallolyticus with an overall MIC90 at < or = 0.06 microg/mL; the highest MIC was only 0.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  - Clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. The bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. At least nine Streptococcus spp. were found, including S. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed Streptococcus spp. (11 strains); S. parasanguis (five strains); S. anginosus (three strains); S. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, and S. vestibularis. There were no S. oralis strains. Among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. Resistance to penicillin (MIC, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among S. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-S. mitis strains (0/25) (P = 0.004). Significantly more S. mitis strains than non-S. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. Isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (P = 0.002). Quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. The young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by S. mitis. Septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by S. mitis (P = 0.007). These results suggest that S. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.
TI  - Identification of 43 Streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene.
AB  - Pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  Streptococcus genus. Two variable regions in the rnpB gene, which encodes the RNA subunit of endonuclease P, were sequenced in two reactions. Of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs Streptococcus anginosus/S. constellatus and S. infantis/S. peroris. A total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial rnpB sequences. All but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpB database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. Principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. The identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems VITEK 2 and Rapid ID 32 Strep. The concordance between pyrosequencing and VITEK 2 was 75%, and for Rapid ID 32 Strep the corresponding figure was 77%. Isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpB DNA sequence analysis that confirmed the identifications by pyrosequencing. In conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpB gene can reliably identify Streptococcus species with high resolution.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - It is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. Intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (ICM) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (Streptococcus criceti, Streptococcus downei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus ratti, Streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis), and 177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. From the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable ICM mass spectra were obtained for the different species. Based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to S. mutans and 16 isolates to S. sobrinus. Two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes as Streptococcus anginosus. In addition, ICM indicated a misclassification for some reference strains (AHT, V 100 and E 49) and re-classified AHT and E 49 as S. ratti and V 100 as S. sobrinus. This was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Based on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of ICM, the isolates identified as either S. mutans or S. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. In the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different S. mutans and three different S. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. ICM proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.
TI  - Identification of non-mutans streptococci organisms in dental plaques recovering  on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar medium.
AB  - The objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-MSO) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (MSB) plates. The dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on MSB. The bacteria growing on the MSB plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing techniques. Our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the MSB plates. Among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-MSO. These 12 colonies were determined to be Streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), S. sanguinis (1 colony), and Pantoea agglomerans (3 colonies). These results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.
TI  - LuxS-based signaling affects Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. We examined the role of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) on S. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a GS-5 luxS-null mutant. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxS mutant formed larger clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfB and gtfC genes, but not the gtfD gene, in the luxS mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth phase. Furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor AI-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. The biofilm defect of the luxS mutant was complemented by strains of S. gordonii, S. sobrinus, and S. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by S. oralis, S. salivarius, or S. sanguinis. Biofilm formation by the luxS mutant was also complemented by Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 but not by a P. gingivalis luxS mutant. These results suggest that the regulation of the glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by AI-2. Furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via AI-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - Expression of the gtfI gene from Streptococcus sobrinus in Streptococcus anginosus using integration-mediated transformation system.
AB  - We have constructed a Streptococcus anginosus transformant expressing the gtfI gene from Streptococcus sobrinus, using a previously developed integration-mediated transformation system to introduce foreign genes onto the oral streptococcal chromosome, and attempted to evaluate the gene expression. In this system, one cloning plasmid and three pACYC184 derivatives, anchor, heterodimer, and integration plasmids were used for the construction of a series of integrants via homologous recombination. A portion of S. sobrinus gtfI gene devoid of approximately 1 kb of the 5'-region derived from pMD39 was cloned into the integration plasmid and introduced onto the S. anginosus chromosome. Next, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to 2.0 kb of the 5'-region of the gtfI gene from S. sobrinus chromosome was further cloned into the cloning plasmid, and the intact gtfI gene was reconstructed following integration. The final S. anginosus integrant successfully secreted the enzymatically active gtfI gene products and extracellular enzyme was characterized. This enzyme produced water-insoluble glucans and glucan-forming activity was stimulated by the addition of dextranT10. When this integrant was grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, the integrant adhered to the glass surface in vitro and this integrant exhibited the different colony morphology on Mitis-Salivarius agar plates compared to S. sobrinus and S. anginosus. These observations strongly suggest that the construction of S. anginosus integrant expressing S. sobrinus gtfI gene using this transformation system may be an effective means of analysis of cariogenic biofilm formation.
TI  - Streptococcus sinensis may react with Lancefield group F antiserum.
AB  - Lancefield group F streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'Streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. Among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by Streptococcus sinensis (type strain HKU4T, HKU5 and HKU6). All three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. Gene sequencing showed no base differences between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of HKU5 and HKU6 and that of HKU4T. All three strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. All grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient air. Lancefield grouping revealed that HKU5 and HKU6 were Lancefield group F, but HKU4T was non-groupable with Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F or G antisera. HKU4T was identified by the Vitek system (GPI), API system (20 STREP) and ATB system (ID32 STREP) as 99 % Streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % S. intermedius and 99.9 % Streptococcus anginosus, respectively. Using the same tests, HKU5 was identified as 87 % Streptococcus sanguinis/Streptococcus gordonii, 59 % Streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % S. anginosus, respectively, and HKU6 as 87 % S. sanguinis/S. gordonii, 77 % Streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % S. anginosus, respectively. The present data revealed that a proportion of Lancefield group F streptococci could be S. sinensis. Lancefield group F streptococci should not be automatically reported as 'S. milleri'.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci by sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region.
AB  - The feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (ITS) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (VS) was evaluated. The ITS regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of VS were amplified by PCR and sequenced. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The ITS lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. The intraspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for S. gordonii strains. The interspecies similarity scores for the ITS sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of VS is not parallel to that of the 16S rRNA genes. One hundred six clinical isolates of VS were identified by the Rapid ID 32 STREP system (bioMerieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by ITS sequencing, and the level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). Most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their ITS sequences. The accuracy of using ITS sequencing for identification of VS was verified by 16S rDNA sequencing for all strains except strains of S. oralis and S. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16S rDNA sequences. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by ITS sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of VS.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - groESL sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The full-length sequences of the groESL genes (also known as cpn10/60) of Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groESL genes of Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius were determined. The lengths of the groES genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groEL determined for 4 species (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, and S. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. The intergenic region (spacer) between the groES and groEL genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. The variation of the groES sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groEL sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). Phylogenetic analysis of the groES and groEL genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of the 16S rRNA gene. The intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. The groESL sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Automated fluorescent in situ hybridization for the specific detection and quantification of oral streptococci in dental plaque.
AB  - Our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. Probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. Results showed that probes ANG541, MIT447, SSP001, and SAL090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe STR405, the S. mutans specific probe MUT590, and the S. sobrinus specific probe SOB174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. Probes STR405, MIT447 and SSP001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. On the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. The combined application of FISH and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or PCR for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - Effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  - It was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  N-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit Streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. The ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. When saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with N-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. Low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. Growth in N-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. No effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. In contrast to what observed with S. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. These results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting S. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species  level by PCR.
AB  - A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Characterization of the Lancefield group C streptococcus 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  - The 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacers of isolates of Streptococcus equi (n = 5), S. zooepidemicus (n = 5), S. equisimilis (n = 3) and S. dysgalactiae (n = 2) were sequenced and compared. There were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. Region 4 was identical to the tRNA(ala) gene found in the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of other streptococci. Regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. However, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for DNA recombination in their evolution. The intergenic spacer of all isolates of S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. Primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all S. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and S. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three S. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as S. equi. S. equi and S. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. Most homology for the group C sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of S. anginosis, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. salivarius and S. agalactiae. A 75-90 nucleotide length shared with S. anginosus and S. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for DNA recombination in the evolution of the spacer. The 16S-23S intergenic spacers indicate that S. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for S. equi and that both are genetically more distant from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae. The intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group C streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for S. zooepidemicus.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. Titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. Pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. Streptococcus anginosus, S. oralis, and S. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. The experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. Salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while sIgA, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. Adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of S. anginosus, S. oralis, and S. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. However, adhesion of laboratory strains of S. gordonii and S. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. This study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Identification of pioneer viridans streptococci in the oral cavity of human neonates.
AB  - Three hundred and sixty-seven strains of pioneer streptococci isolated from the mouths of 40 healthy, full-term infants during the first month of life were examined by two taxonomic schemes that incorporated biochemical and physiological characteristics, IgA1 protease production and glycosidase activities. Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and S. oralis comprised 55.0% of the pioneer streptococci isolated from neonates. S. salivarius constituted 25.3% of the isolates, while S. anginosus, S. mitis biovar 2, S. sanguis and S. gordonii accounted collectively for 11.4%. Difficulties in identifying streptococci were encountered and 8.4% of the 367 isolates could not be assigned to a recognised species.
TI  - [Clinical significance of bacteremia caused by streptococci of the viridans group].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The viridans group Streptococcus (SVG) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of SVG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation (Hemoline/BioMerieux) of SVG (Api 20 STREP/BioMerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. RESULTS: The most frequent species of SVG isolated were: S. sanguis II (29.4%), S. mitis (27.3%) and S. anginosus (12.9%). With regard to the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating S. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and S. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). More than half of the isolations of S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. mutans and S. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II, S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. acidominimus). The significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (S. sanguis II being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). In 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. The endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for S. sanguis II, S. sanguis I, S. mutans, S. bovis and S. adjacens; similar in both diseases for S. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for S. anginosus. CONCLUSIONS: In this series the isolation of SVG group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of SVG.
TI  - Conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin G-cross-reactive domains of antigen I/II in oral streptococci.
AB  - In this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG)-cross-reacting domains on the SR molecule, an antigen I/II-related protein from S. mutans serotype f. Mapping of the SR molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the N-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the SR molecule. In order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans group and 11 nonmutans oral Streptococcus strains (S. anginosus, S. milleri, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and S. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using DNA probes designed to map these two regions. All the mutans group strains except S. rattus and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the C-terminal part of the SR molecule, especially the hIgG-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the N-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. Almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with SR from S. mutans serotype f, P1 from S. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the hIgG-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the C and N termini and in the proline-rich repeats. These results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-IgG antibodies.
TI  - Mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  - Mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35S-[SO4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of Streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. The highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of Streptococcus mutans tested. Little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 Streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 Streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 Streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. The highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh Streptococcus gordonii isolates. This is the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. Streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.
TI  - Interaction of the salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with the bacterium Streptococcus salivarius HB.
AB  - The interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein EP-GP with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. EP-GP could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of ELISA or by electrophoresis in combination with Western Transfer. The results indicated that EP-GP is bound only by Streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides fragilis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. rattus, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus. Binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be pH-dependent with a maximum binding between pH 5 and 6. For further characterization of the binding of EP-GP to S. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. EP-GP was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. We were able to identify a 27-kD EP-GP binding protein, by extraction of S. salivarius-cell wall antigens and electrophoretic techniques. In addition to EP-GP, S. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory IgA and low-molecular-weight mucin (MG-2).
TI  - Oral streptococcal colonization of infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and proportions of different streptococcal species among the streptococcal flora during infancy. A total of 60 oral samples were collected by oral swabbing of the buccal mucosa and alveolar ridges of 18 infants before tooth eruption and from buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth after tooth eruption. A total of 549 isolates on mitis salivarius agar were speciated, principally by recently revised biochemical criteria of Kilian et al. Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 predominated, both in prevalence (89%) and proportion of oral streptococci recovered in each sample (median = 87% of streptococcal flora). Streptococcus salivarius was also prevalent (94%) but generally represented a small percentage of the total streptococcal flora (median = 3%). Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus anginosus strains were detected in approximately one third of predentate and dentate infants in the first year of life. Streptococcus sanguis strains were not detected before tooth eruption, but could be detected in 7/14 of the infants with teeth. Thus, S. mitis constitutes the major component of the initially colonizing streptococcal microbiota of the young infant.
TI  - Distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  - The isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. The effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. Saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups: (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). Up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. mutans, and S. gordonii. The mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (CFU) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. Streptococci were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal CFU and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. There was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. In contrast to studies using older classifications, S. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). S. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. S. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. S. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB  - A collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, S. parasanguis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, s. intermedius, S. mutans and S. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. The resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within S. sanguis. The scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.
TI  - A modified mitis salivarius medium for a caries diagnostic test.
AB  - A new medium, MSKB, composed of mitis salivarius agar base, sorbitol, kanamycin sulfate and bacitracin, has been developed that is more selective for recovery of mutans streptococci (mutans) than the so called mitis salivarius bacitracin (MSB) medium. MSB and MSKB were compared for recovery and selectivity of mutans by plating saliva samples as well as pure cultures on both media. Sixty saliva samples were plated and counted for mutans and non-mutans colonies. Thirty-six samples had greater numbers of non-mutans on MSB than on MSKB, and 14 of the 36 had non-mutans colonies that could be visually confused with mutants. The recovery of mutans on MSKB was approximately 13% less than on MSB. The selectivity and recovery of MSB and MSKB were evaluated over 1-5 months of storage at 4 degrees C. Streptococcus anginosus grew on MSB after 1 month, but not on MSKB. Streptococcus milleri type 2 grew on both media after 4 months.
TI  - Intrageneric structure of Streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences.
AB  - The partial 16S rRNA sequences of 24 Streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. A comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. The clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. The pyogenic group was extended to include Streptococcus agalactiae, S. parauberis, S. porcinus, and S. uberis. Four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, and S. oralis. Some species (e.g., S. suis and S. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. Our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.
TI  - Ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  - Recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. With this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. The results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. Apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. Initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and Streptococcus oralis. Our investigation showed that S. sanguis and S. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. In contrast, S. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. Streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of S. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. The dorsum of the tongue was dominated by S. mitis biovar 2 and Streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. Streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. This lends further support to the concept of IgA1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.
TI  - Ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB  - A collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. This property was found in most strains of Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus salivarius. In contrast, all strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus vestibularis, and Streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. A rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.
TI  - Sialidase activity of the "Streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. Sialidase was produced by all strains of Streptococcus oralis and S. intermedius and by a majority of S. mitis strains. S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. vestibularis, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, S. constellatus, "S. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. Sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with Candida albicans.
AB  - Thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with Candida albicans. Streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees C-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees C (or at 28 degrees C) increased their coaggregating activity with these streptococci by at least tenfold. This was a property common to four C. albicans strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and MEN) and two of which were not (MM2002 and CA2). The expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin B. The strains of S. sanguis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved C. albicans cells. There was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. Strains of Streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with C. albicans, and the coaggregation with S. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. The coaggregation reactions of S. sanguis and S. gordonii with C. albicans were inhibited by EDTA and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition of lactose or other simple sugars. These observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of C. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.
TI  - Adherence of oral streptococci to composite resin restorative materials.
AB  - The frequency of oral streptococcal bacterial isolates detected on composite resin squares attached to maxillary first molars in 12 volunteers was 62.1 per cent. These cocci consisted of Streptococcus mitior (52.8 per cent), S. sanguis (20.2 per cent), S. oralis (8.6 per cent), S. salivarius (1.0 per cent) and S. anginosus (0.3 per cent). An electron microscopic study of these organisms labelled with [3H]thymidine for in vitro adhesiveness to the resin revealed that S. mitior was the most adhesive, and that its pronounced adhesiveness is associated with its characteristic extracellular ultrastructure.
TI  - Evaluation of the API 20 STREP system for species identification of "viridans" streptococci isolated from bacteremia.
AB  - Species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the API 20 STREP system (API system S. A., Montalieu-Vercien, France) and the conventional method. There are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. The API 20 STREP system correctly identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. All strains of S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius and S. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. The correct identification rates for S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. MG-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. The difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. The study indicates that the API 20 STREP system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
