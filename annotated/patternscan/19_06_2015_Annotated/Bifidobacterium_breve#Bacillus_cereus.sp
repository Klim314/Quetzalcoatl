TI  == bacillus subtilis natto: a non-toxic source of poly-gamma-glutamic acid that could be used as a cryoprotectant for probiotic bacteria.
AB  == it is common practice to freeze dry probiotic bacteria to improve their shelf life. however, the freeze drying process itself can be detrimental to their viability. the viability of probiotics could be maintained if they are administered within a microbially produced biodegradable polymer - poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-pga) - matrix. although the antifreeze activity of gamma-pga is well known, it has not been used for maintaining the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying. the aim of this study was to test the effect of gamma-pga (produced by b. subtilis natto atcc 15245) on the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying and to test the toxigenic potential of b. subtilis natto. 10% gamma-pga was found to protect lactobacillus paracasei significantly better than 10% sucrose, whereas it showed comparable cryoprotectant activity to sucrose when it was used to protect bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. although gamma-pga is known to be non-toxic, it is crucial to ascertain the toxigenic potential of its source, b. subtilis natto. presence of six genes that are known to encode for toxins were investigated: three component hemolysin (hbl d/a), three component non-haemolytic enterotoxin (nheb), b. cereus enterotoxin t (bcet), enterotoxin fm (entfm), sphingomyelinase  (sph) and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase (piplc). from our investigations, none of these six genes were present in b. subtilis natto. moreover, haemolytic and lecithinase activities were found to be absent. our work contributes a biodegradable polymer from a non-toxic source for the cryoprotection of probiotic bacteria, thus improving their survival during the manufacturing process.

TI  == bovine intestinal bacteria inactivate and degrade ceftiofur and ceftriaxone with  multiple beta-lactamases.
AB  == the veterinary cephalosporin drug ceftiofur is rapidly degraded in the bovine intestinal tract. a cylinder-plate assay was used to detect microbiologically active ceftiofur, and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify the amount of ceftiofur remaining after incubation  with bovine intestinal anaerobic bacteria, which were isolated from colon contents or feces from 8 cattle. ninety-six percent of the isolates were able to  inactivate ceftiofur to some degree, and 54% actually degraded the drug. none of  9 fungal isolates inactivated or degraded ceftiofur. facultative and obligate anaerobic bacterial species that inactivated or degraded ceftiofur were identified with vitek and biolog systems, respectively. a subset of ceftiofur degraders also degraded the chemically similar drug ceftriaxone. most of the species of bacteria that degraded ceftiofur belonged to the genera bacillus and bacteroides. pcr analysis of bacterial dna detected specific beta-lactamase genes. bacillus cereus and b. mycoides isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. seven isolates of bacteroides spp. produced multiple beta-lactamases, including possibly cepa, and metallo-beta-lactamases. isolates of eubacterium biforme, bifidobacterium breve,  and several clostridium spp. also produced ceftiofur-degrading beta-lactamases. an agar gel overlay technique on isoelectric focusing separations of bacterial lysates showed that beta-lactamase enzymes were sufficient to degrade ceftiofur.  these results suggest that ceftiofur is inactivated nonenzymatically and degraded enzymatically by multiple beta-lactamases from bacteria in the large intestines of cattle.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.
