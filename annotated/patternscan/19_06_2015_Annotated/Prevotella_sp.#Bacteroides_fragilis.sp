TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == multicentre survey of the in-vitro activity of seven antimicrobial agents, including ertapenem, against recently isolated gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in greece.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of penicillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, ertapenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were evaluated against 138 gram-negative anaerobic isolates (82 bacteroides fragilis group, 17 non-fragilis  bacteroides spp., 31 prevotella spp., four fusobacterium spp., two veillonella spp., one porphyromonas sp. and one tissierella praeacuta) collected from six general hospitals in athens, greece. overall rates of non-susceptibility (both resistant and intermediately-resistant) to penicillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic  acid were 81.8% and 2.3%, respectively. the rates of non-susceptibility to cefoxitin and clindamycin were 30.3% and 31.1%, respectively, and that for metronidazole was 4.3% (four prevotella spp. isolates, one porphyromonas sp. isolate and one b. fragilis isolate). only the single b. fragilis isolate was nim-positive by pcr. only one b. fragilis isolate was resistant to both carbapenems tested, while six more bacteroides spp. isolates were imipenem-susceptible and ertapenem-non-susceptible. the mic range, mic(50) and mic(90) values were comparable for imipenem and ertapenem, although ertapenem mic(90)s were one or two two-fold dilutions higher.

TI  == urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. the types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include  para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. the anaerobes  recovered in these studies were gram-negative bacilli (including bacteroides fragilis and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp.), clostridium sp., anaerobic gram-positive cocci and actinomyces sp. in many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. the recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. these antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.

TI  == prevalence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli in routine clinical specimens.
AB  == a total of 206 gram negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 2591 routine clinical specimens. majority of them (78.2%) were part of a mixed flora. a high incidence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli was found in post-operative wound infections and diabetic foot infections (30.1%), followed by necrotizing fasciitis and crush injuries (18%), pus of empyema and lung abscesses (14.5%) and aspirates from other deep abscesses (10.7%). bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently recognized species (42.2%), followed by fusobacterium sp. (17.4%), prevotella sp. (15.1%) and porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

TI  == high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == this prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. one to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the prevotella genus (bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). pcr assays were used to detect cfxa and cepa/cbla, the genes encoding class a/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the bacteroides fragilis group. the present investigation confirmed  the role of prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. additionally, this pcr screening showed (1): the high prevalence of cfxa beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepa/cbla (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxa in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  == the bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. predisposing conditions were present in all instances. sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. the abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients.  there were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 bacteroides fragilis group), fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and prevotella sp.  and actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). a total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 gram-positive cocci and 6 haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess,  and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
