TI  == clinical utility and performance of sock sampling in weaner pig diarrhoea.
AB  == low pathogen diarrhoea is a group-level diagnosis, characterised by non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea. in the current study, the apparent prevalence of low  pathogen diarrhoea outbreaks in danish herds was investigated along with the clinical utility of a laboratory examination for intestinal disease, agreement between three consecutive herd examinations from the same herd and agreement between quantitative pcr results from pooled faecal samples and sock samples. twenty-four veterinarians submitted faecal and sock samples for quantitative pcr  testing from outbreaks of diarrhoea in nursery pigs (n=38 herds) where the farmer or veterinarian had decided that antimicrobial treatment was necessary. the veterinarians were asked to fill in a questionnaire and participate in telephone  interviews. the apparent prevalence of low pathogen diarrhoea was 0.18 (95% cl: 0.08-0.34). agreement between the veterinarians' clinical aetiological diagnosis  and the pooled faecal sample was 0.18 (95% cl: 0.08-0.34), and cohen's kappa was  0.03 (95% cl: -0.08 to 0.14). antibiotic treatment or prevention strategies were  changed in 0.63 (95% cl: 0.46-0.78) of the herds, and the veterinarians indicated that, for 0.32 (95% cl: 0.18-0.50) of the herds, changes were related to the diagnostic results from the laboratory examination performed in the study. in 0.16 (95% cl: 0.05-0.36) of the herds, the same infections were demonstrated at all three consecutive examinations. no herds had three consecutive diarrhoea outbreaks classified as low pathogen diarrhoea. for the quantitative results (log10 of the summed amounts of lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira pilosicoli, escherichia coli f4 and f18) agreement between pooled faecal samples and sock samples was evaluated. lin's concordance correlation coefficient was 0.69 (95% cl: 0.48-0.82), and the mean difference between the two types of samples was -0.38 log10 bacteria/g faeces (sd=1.59log10 bacteria/g faeces; 95% ci: -0.90 to 0.14log10 bacteria/g faeces). agreement for the dichotomised results was 0.89 (95% ci: 0.75-0.97) when test results were classified as low pathogen diarrhoea or not, and cohen's kappa was 0.61 (95% ci: 0.26-0.95). in relation to detection  of the individual infections, agreement was 0.63 (95% ci: 0.46-0.78), and cohen's kappa was 0.53 (95% ci: 0.34-0.71). in conclusion, low pathogen diarrhoea is a common finding amongst diarrhoea outbreaks that are subjected to antibiotic batch treatment in danish nursery pigs. sock samples seem to offer a reliable diagnostic method with impact on clinical decisions for treatment and prevention. however, both the diarrhoea type and the aetiology change with time in the majority of herds, indicating a potential need for frequent diagnostic examinations.

TI  == herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs - a pilot study.
AB  == background: the major indication for antibiotic use in danish pigs is treatment of intestinal diseases post weaning. clinical decisions on antibiotic batch medication are often based on inspection of diarrhoeic pools on the pen floor. in some of these treated diarrhoea outbreaks, intestinal pathogens can only be demonstrated in a small number of pigs within the treated group (low pathogen diarrhoea). termination of antibiotic batch medication in herds suffering from such diarrhoea could potentially reduce the consumption of antibiotics in the pig industry. the objective of the present pilot study was to suggest criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs. data previously collected from 20 danish herds were used to create a case series of clinical diarrhoea outbreaks normally subjected to antibiotic treatment. in the present study, these diarrhoea outbreaks were classified as low pathogen (<15% of the pigs having bacterial intestinal disease) (n =5 outbreaks) or high pathogen (>/=15% of the pigs having bacterial intestinal disease) (n =15 outbreaks). based on the case series, different diagnostic procedures were explored, and criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea were suggested. the effect of sampling variation was explored by simulation. results: the diagnostic procedure  with the highest combined herd-level sensitivity and specificity was qpcr testing of a pooled sample containing 20 randomly selected faecal samples. the criteria for a positive test result (high pathogen diarrhoea outbreak) were an average of  1.5 diarrhoeic faecal pools on the floor of each pen in the room under investigation and a pathogenic bacterial load >/=35,000 per gram in the faecal pool tested by qpcr. the bacterial load was the sum of lawsonia intracellularis,  brachyspira pilosicoli and escherichia coli f4 and f18 bacteria per gram faeces.  the herd-diagnostic performance was (herd-level) diagnostic sensitivity =0.99, diagnostic specificity =0.80, positive predictive value =0.94 and negative predictive value =0.96. conclusions: the pilot study suggests criteria for herd diagnosis of low pathogen diarrhoea in growing pigs. the suggested criteria should now be evaluated, and the effect of terminating antibiotic batch medication in herds identified as suffering from low pathogen diarrhoea should be explored.

TI  == diagnostic performance of fecal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  for detection of lawsonia intracellularis-associated proliferative enteropathy in nursery pigs.
AB  == quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) tests for detection and quantification of lawsonia intracellularis in feces from pigs have been developed. the objective of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a fecal qpcr test for detection of nursery pigs with l. intracellularis-associated proliferative enteropathy (pe) under field conditions. furthermore, the diagnostic performance for different subpopulations of pigs was  investigated, including pigs infected or noninfected with porcine circovirus-2, brachyspira pilosicoli, and escherichia coli. the diagnostic performance was evaluated in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. data from pigs originating from 20 herds with antibiotic treatment requiring diarrhea outbreaks  from a prior study were reused. before treatment, pigs were randomly selected for histological and immunohistochemical examination of intestinal segments and fecal quantification of l. intracellularis by qpcr. a total of 313 pigs (157 without diarrhea, 156 with diarrhea) were included in the statistical analysis, and 37 pigs (11.8%) were classified as pe positives (defined as proliferative histological lesions in combination with l. intracellularis demonstration by immunohistochemistry). lawsonia intracellularis was detected by qpcr in feces from 91 pigs (29.1%). a nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis provided an area under the roc curve (0.93) and an optimal cutoff value  of 4.8 log10 l. intracellularis bacteria/g feces. this cutoff provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.84 and diagnostic specificity of 0.93. the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were significantly different between herds (p < 0.0001). numerically, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were different between subpopulations of pigs, but no significant differences were demonstrated.

TI  == diagnostic investigation of porcine periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome: lack  of compelling evidence linking to common porcine pathogens.
AB  == porcine periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome (pfts), an increasingly recognized syndrome in the swine industry of north america, is characterized by the anorexia of nursery pigs noticeable within 1 week of weaning, and progressive loss of body condition and lethargy during the next 1-2 weeks. morbidity caused by pfts is moderate, but case fatality is high. the etiology of pfts is presently unknown and may include infectious agent(s), noninfectious factors, or both. pfts was identified in a high health status farm with good management in early 2007. a diagnostic investigation was undertaken to identify the pathological lesions of,  and infectious agents associated with, pigs demonstrating typical clinical signs. affected (pfts-sick) and unaffected (pfts-hlthy) pigs from an affected farm, and  unaffected pigs from 2 unaffected farms, were examined. the most prevalent lesions in pfts-sick pigs were superficial lymphocytic fundic gastritis, atrophic enteritis, superficial colitis, lymphocytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, mild nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and thymic atrophy. rotavirus a and betacoronavirus 1 (porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) were identified only in pfts-sick pigs, but the significance of the viruses is uncertain because pfts is not consistent with the typical presentation following  infection by these pathogens. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine circovirus-2, influenza a virus, alphacoronavirus 1 (transmissible gastroenteritis virus), torque teno virus 1, brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and brachyspira pilosicoli were not identified in pfts-sick pigs. suid herpesvirus 2  (porcine cytomegalovirus), porcine enteric calicivirus, torque teno virus 2, pathogenic escherichia coli, and coccidia were detected in both pfts-sick and pfts-hlthy pigs. it was concluded that there is a lack of compelling evidence that pfts is caused by any of these pathogens.

TI  == the use of quantitative pcr for identification and quantification of brachyspira  pilosicoli, lawsonia intracellularis and escherichia coli fimbrial types f4 and f18 in pig feces.
AB  == four quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays were evaluated for quantitative detection of  brachyspira pilosicoli, lawsonia intracellularis, and e. coli fimbrial types f4 and f18 in pig feces. standard curves were based on feces spiked with the respective reference strains. the detection limits from the spiking experiments were 10(2) bacteria/g feces for bpilo-qpcr and laws-qpcr, 10(3)cfu/g feces for f4-qpcr and f18-qpcr. the pcr efficiency for all four qpcr assays was between 0.91 and 1.01 with r(2) above 0.993. standard curves, slopes and elevation, varied between assays and between measurements from pure dna from reference strains and feces spiked with the respective strains. the linear ranges found for spiked fecal samples differed both from the linear ranges from pure culture of the reference strains and between the qpcr tests. the linear ranges were five log units for f4-qpcr, and laws-qpcr, six log units for f18-qpcr and three log units  for bpilo-qpcr in spiked feces. when measured on pure dna from the reference strains used in spiking experiments, the respective log ranges were: seven units  for bpilo-qpcr, laws-qpcr and f18-qpcr and six log units for f4-qpcr. this shows  the importance of using specific standard curves, where each pathogen is analysed in the same matrix as sample dna. the qpcrs were compared to traditional bacteriological diagnostic methods and found to be more sensitive than cultivation for e. coli and b. pilosicoli. the qpcr assay for lawsonia was also more sensitive than the earlier used method due to improvements in dna extraction. in addition, as samples were not analysed for all four pathogen agents by traditional diagnostic methods, many samples were found positive for agents that were not expected on the basis of age and case history. the use of quantitative pcr tests for diagnosis of enteric diseases provides new possibilities for veterinary diagnostics. the parallel simultaneous analysis for  several bacteria in multi-qpcr and the determination of the quantities of the infectious agents increases the information obtained from the samples and the chance for obtaining a relevant diagnosis.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == evaluation of recombinant brachyspira pilosicoli oligopeptide-binding proteins as vaccine candidates in a mouse model of intestinal spirochaetosis.
AB  == the anaerobic intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli colonizes the large intestine of humans, and various species of animals and birds, in which it may induce a mild colitis and diarrhoea. the aim of the current study was to evaluate the use of putative oligopeptide-binding proteins of b. pilosicoli as vaccine components. a partial genome sequence of b. pilosicoli porcine strain 95/1000 was subjected to bioinformatics analysis, and six genes predicted to encode oligopeptide-binding proteins were selected. following a pcr-based distribution study of the genes across different strains of the spirochaete, they were amplified from b. pilosicoli human strain wesb and cloned in escherichia coli. the recombinant histidine-tagged proteins were purified and subjected to in vitro and in vivo immunogenicity analysis. recombinant products (p-1 and p-3) from two  genes that were immunogenic and recognized by sera from pigs that had recovered from b. pilosicoli infections were tested in a mouse model of intestinal spirochaetosis. for each recombinant protein, groups of 12 c3h/hej mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with 100 microg protein emulsified in freund's incomplete adjuvant, twice with a 2 week interval. two weeks later the vaccinated and non-vaccinated control animals were challenged orally with b. pilosicoli strain wesb. both proteins induced systemic and local colonic igg antibody responses, and, following experimental infection, the cumulative number of colonization days was significantly (p<0.001) less in both groups of vaccinated mice compared to the control mice. there were significantly (p=0.012) fewer mice  colonized in the group vaccinated with p-1 than in the non-vaccinated control group. the results suggest that oligopeptide-binding proteins may have potential  for use as components of vaccines for b. pilosicoli.

TI  == penicillin resistance in the intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli associated with oxa-136 and oxa-137, two new variants of the class d beta-lactamase oxa-63.
AB  == penicillin resistance mediated by beta-lactamase activity has been reported previously in the anaerobic intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli, and a  novel class d beta-lactamase (oxa-63) hydrolysing oxacillin was described recently in a resistant human strain from france. in the current study, 18 b. pilosicoli strains from australia and papua new guinea were tested for ampicillin and oxacillin susceptibility, and investigated for the presence of the class d beta-lactamase gene blaoxa-63 using pcr. pcr products were amplified from seven human and four porcine strains that were penicillin resistant, but not from seven penicillin-sensitive strains. sequence analysis of the whole gene amplified from  seven of the resistant strains from humans and pigs revealed only minor nucleotide differences among them, but there were significant differences compared with blaoxa-63. the predicted amino acid sequence of the enzyme from all seven strains had the same key structural motifs as the previously reported oxa-63, but two variants with 94-95% identity with oxa-63 were identified. oxa-136 had an additional amino acid and 12 other consistent amino acid substitutions compared with oxa-63. oxa-137 had the same differences compared with oxa-63 as oxa-136, but had an additional amino acid substitution at position 16. no structures consistent with integrons or transposons were found in the nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of blaoxa-136 in partially sequenced b. pilosicoli strain 95/1000, and the gc content (25.2 mol%) of the gene was similar to that of the whole genome. the gene encoding oxa-136 from b. pilosicoli strain  cof-10 conferred penicillin resistance on escherichia coli. this study shows that penicillin resistance in human and porcine b. pilosicoli strains from australia is associated with the production of two variants of oxa-63, and that susceptible strains lack the genes encoding oxa-63 or the variants.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of oxa-63, a new class d beta-lactamase  from brachyspira pilosicoli bm4442.
AB  == brachyspira pilosicoli bm4442, isolated from the feces of a patient with diarrhea at the hospital saint-michel in paris, was resistant to oxacillin (mic > 256 microg/ml) but remained susceptible to cephalosporins and to the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. cloning and sequencing of the corresponding resistance determinant revealed a coding sequence of 807 bp encoding a new class  d beta-lactamase named oxa-63. the bla oxa-63 gene was chromosomally located and  not part of a transposon or of an integron. oxa-63 shared 54% identity with fus-1 (oxa-85), an oxacillinase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, and 25 to 44% identity with other class d beta-lactamases (dbls) and contained all the conserved structural motifs of dbls. escherichia coli carrying the bla oxa-63 gene exhibited resistance to benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin but remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. mature oxa-63 consisted of a 31.5-kda polypeptide and appeared to be dimeric. kinetic analysis  revealed that oxa-63 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing oxacillin, benzylpenicillin, and ampicillin with catalytic efficiencies of 980, 250, and 150 mm(-1) s(-1), respectively. the enzyme did not apparently interact with oxyimino-cephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. unlike fus-1 and other dbls, oxa-63 was strongly inhibited by clavulanic acid (50% inhibitory concentration [ic50] of 2 microm) and tazobactam (ic50 of 0.16 microm) and exhibited low susceptibility to nacl (ic50 of >2 m). oxa-63 is the first dbl described for the  anaerobic spirochete b. pilosicoli.

TI  == distribution of the clpx gene in brachyspira species and reactivity of recombinant brachyspira pilosicoli clpx with sera from mice and humans.
AB  == previously, a clpx gene encoding a predicted 67 kda membrane-associated atpase subunit of the clp protease (clpx) was identified in a porcine strain (95/1,000)  of the intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli. in the current study, the distribution of this large clpx gene was investigated in a collection of strains  representing all seven brachyspira spp. using pcr with internal primers, an 878 bp portion of the gene was detected in 29 of 35 strains (83 %) of b. pilosicoli,  6 of 24 strains (25 %) of brachyspira hyodysenteriae, 14 of 16 strains (88 %) of  brachyspira intermedia, 6 of 17 strains (35 %) of brachyspira innocens, 1 of 6 strains (17 %) of brachyspira murdochii, 1 of 2 strains (50 %) of brachyspira aalborgi and not in the single strain of brachyspira alvinipulli. the whole gene  was sequenced from 20 brachyspira spp. strains and compared with the clpx gene from b. pilosicoli 95/1,000 (genbank accession no. ay466377). the genes had 99.3-99.7 % nucleotide sequence similarity and the predicted products had 99.7-100 % amino acid sequence similarity. the clpx gene from wesb, a human strain of b. pilosicoli, was cloned and expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in escherichia coli bl21. the purified protein was used to vaccinate mice and their sera were found to recognize the expected approximately 67 kda protein  in whole-cell preparations of wesb. sera from mice vaccinated with formalin-treated whole-cell proteins of wesb reacted with the recombinant protein. these results indicate that clpx is both conserved and immunogenic and hence might be useful as a subunit vaccine component for brachyspira spp. infections. sera from humans with no known exposure to b. pilosicoli reacted with the recombinant clpx protein, indicating that it is unlikely to be useful as a reagent for serological detection of brachyspira spp. infections.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of fus-1 (oxa-85), a narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
AB  == previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate  decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.

TI  == mutations in ribosomal protein l3 and 23s ribosomal rna at the peptidyl transferase centre are associated with reduced susceptibility to tiamulin in brachyspira spp. isolates.
AB  == the pleuromutilin antibiotic tiamulin binds to the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre. three groups of brachyspira spp. isolates with reduced tiamulin susceptibility were analysed to define resistance mechanisms to the drug. mutations were identified in genes encoding ribosomal protein l3 and 23s rrna at  positions proximal to the peptidyl transferase centre. in two groups of laboratory-selected mutants, mutations were found at nucleotide positions 2032, 2055, 2447, 2499, 2504 and 2572 of 23s rrna (escherichia coli numbering) and at amino acid positions 148 and 149 of ribosomal protein l3 (brachyspira pilosicoli  numbering). in a third group of clinical b. hyodysenteriae isolates, only a single mutation at amino acid 148 of ribosomal protein l3 was detected. chemical  footprinting experiments show a reduced binding of tiamulin to ribosomal subunits from mutants with decreased susceptibility to the drug. this reduction in drug binding is likely the resistance mechanism for these strains. hence, the identified mutations located near the tiamulin binding site are predicted to be responsible for the resistance phenotype. the positions of the mutated residues relative to the bound drug advocate a model where the mutations affect tiamulin binding indirectly through perturbation of nucleotide u2504.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in brachyspira pilosicoli with special reference to point mutations in the 23s rrna gene associated with macrolide and lincosamide resistance.
AB  == a point mutation in the 23s rrna gene causes macrolide and lincosamide resistance in brachyspira hyodysenteriae. the possible occurrence of a similar mutation in brachyspira pilosicoli was studied and the mics of six antimicrobial agents for swedish field isolates of b. pilosicoli were determined. of 10 isolates with high mics of macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics, six had a mutation in nucleotide position 2058 or 2059 in the 23s rrna gene as compared to the wild type of escherichia coli, whereas none of 10 tylosin-susceptible isolates were mutated in this region. the mutations found in position 2058 were a --> t transversions, and in position 2059 either a --> g transitions or a --> c transversions. the mics at which 90% of the b. pilosicoli field isolates were inhibited by tylosin, erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tiamulin, and carbadox, were >256, >256, >4, 4, 2, and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively. in conclusion, point mutations in positions 2058 and 2059 of the 23s rrna gene can cause macrolide and lincosamide resistance in b. pilosicoli. macrolide resistance is widespread among swedish field isolates of b. pilosicoli. notably also a few isolates with elevated mics of tiamulin were found.

TI  == identification and cloning of the gene encoding bmpc: an outer-membrane lipoprotein associated with brachyspira pilosicoli membrane vesicles.
AB  == the intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli causes colitis in a wide variety of host species. little is known about the structure or protein constituents of the b. pilosicoli outer membrane (om). to identify surface-exposed proteins in this species, membrane vesicles were isolated from b. pilosicoli strain 95-1000 cells by osmotic lysis in dh(2)o followed by isopycnic  centrifugation in sucrose density gradients. the membrane vesicles were separated into a high-density fraction (hdmv; rho=1.18 g cm(-3)) and a low-density fraction (ldmv; rho=1.12 g cm(-3)). both fractions were free of flagella and soluble protein contamination. ldmv contained predominantly om markers (lipo-oligosaccharide and a 29 kda b. pilosicoli om protein) and was used as a source of antigens to produce mabs. five b. pilosicoli-specific mabs reacting with proteins with molecular masses of 23, 24, 35, 61 and 79 kda were characterized. the 23 kda protein was only partially soluble in triton x-114, whereas the 24 and 35 kda proteins were enriched in the detergent phase, implying that they were integral membrane proteins or lipoproteins. all three proteins were localized to the b. pilosicoli om by immunogold labelling using specific mabs. the gene encoding the abundant, surface-exposed 23 kda protein was identified by screening a b. pilosicoli 95-1000 genome library with the mab and was expressed in escherichia coli. sequence analysis showed that it encoded a unique lipoprotein, designated bmpc. recombinant bmpc partitioned predominantly in the om fraction of e. coli strain solr. the mab to bmpc was used to screen a collection of 13 genetically heterogeneous strains of b. pilosicoli isolated from five different host species. interestingly, only strain 95-1000 was reactive with the mab, indicating that either the surface-exposed epitope on bmpc is variable between strains or that the protein is restricted in its distribution within b. pilosicoli.

TI  == increasing the viscosity of the intestinal contents stimulates proliferation of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and brachyspira pilosicoli in weaner pigs.
AB  == the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of increased viscosity of the intestinal digesta on proliferation of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and the intestinal spirochaete brachyspira pilosicoli in weaned pigs. pigs were fed an experimental diet based on cooked white rice (r), which was supplemented with  carboxymethylcellulose (cmc; 40 g/kg diet) to increase digesta viscosity. thirty-six piglets weaned at 21 d of age were divided into six groups, three of which were fed r and three addition of cmc increased digesta viscosity in the ileum (p=0.01), caecum (p=0.0007) and colon (p=0.0035), without increasing indices of large intestinal fermentation. pigs fed developed a natural infection  with enterotoxigenic e. coli after weaning and had more (p<0.0001) diarrhoea than pigs fed r. subsequent experimental infection of two groups of pigs with b. pilosicoli resulted in more (p<0.0001) colonisation in pigs fed than r. at this time, all pigs fed had wetter (p<0.0001) faeces than those fed r, irrespective of whether they were infected with b. pilosicoli, but infected pigs also had an increased (p=0.025) number of days with diarrhoea post-infection irrespective of  diet. in pigs fed it was not clear to what extent the increased viscosity associated with cmc, or the concurrent infection with enterotoxigenic e. coli, was responsible for the increased proliferation of b. pilosicoli. in a second experiment, five pigs that were weaned onto an r diet were transferred onto 3 weeks later. these pigs did not develop a natural infection with enterotoxigenic  e. coli after the diet change, confirming the particular susceptibility of pigs to enterotoxigenic e. coli proliferation immediately post-weaning.

TI  == risk factors for intestinal pathogens in danish finishing pig herds.
AB  == the objective of this investigation was to identify risk factors for infection with the intestinal bacteria: lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira hyodysenteriae, serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira pilosicoli and swine-pathogenic escherichia coli (serogroups o138, o139, o141 and o149) in danish finishing pig herds.a total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. from each herd, 20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50 kg. in total, 1580 faecal samples were collected and examined by polymerase chain reaction (l. intracellularis) or culture (all other agents). information on feed and management procedures was collected by filling in questionnaires at the herd visits. the questionnaires included information on 29 dichotomous variables and three continuous variables. variables with p<0.25 in a preliminary screening (chi2- or t-test) were selected for the statistical modelling. our conclusions, based on the results of multifactorial logistic regression (cut-off: p=0.05), were the following: 1. consistent batch production was associated with reduced prevalences of l. intracellularis and weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (s. intermedia, b. innocens, b. pilosicoli) (or's=0.43 and 0.06, respectively). 2. home-mixed (and/or non-pelleted) feed was  associated with reduced prevalences of l. intracellularis and weakly -haemolytic  spirochetes (or's=0.6 and 0.4, respectively). 3. providing straw to finishers was associated with a reduced prevalence of weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (or=0.28-0.32). 4. not using antimicrobial growth promoters for piglets was associated with an increased prevalence of s. intermedia (or=11.11). 5. rare occurrence of post-weaning diarrhoea (as opposed to common) was associated with an increased prevalence of weakly -haemolytic spirochetes (or=8.3-13.7).

AB  == brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae induces a mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease in pigs. the production of a beta-hemolysin has been considered a major virulence attribute of this organism. previous reports have failed to correlate a specific cloned gene sequence with a purified beta-hemolytic protein sequence. thus, questions still remain concerning the structural gene sequence of the hemolysin. to answer this question unequivocally, the beta-hemolytic toxin was purified from extracts of log-phase spirochetes, and the n-terminal amino acid sequence was determined (k-d-v-v-a-n-q-l-n-i-s-d-k) and compared with the translated sequences of previously cloned genes, tlya to tlyc. the lack of homology between tlya to tlyc translated sequences and the purified beta-hemolytic toxin sequence resulted in the study that is reported here. a degenerate probe was designed based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the  purified beta-hemolysin and used to screen a b. hyodysenteriae genomic library. three overlapping clones were identified, and one was sequenced to reveal an open reading frame coding for a putative 8.93-kda polypeptide containing the n-terminal sequence of the purified beta-hemolysin. to distinguish this gene from the tlya to tlyc genes, it has been designated hlya. a hemolysis-negative escherichia coli strains containing hlya was beta-hemolytic on blood agar media.  also, the hemolytic activity of the recombinant protein had identical protease and lipase sensitivities and electrophoretic mobility to those of native b. hyodysenteriae beta-hemolysin. based on sequence analysis, the translated protein had a pi of 4.3, an alpha-helical structure, and a phosphopantetheine binding motif. hybridization analysis of genomic dna indicated that the hlya gene was present in b. hyodysenteriae and b. intermedia but was not detected in b. innocens, b. pilosicoli, or b. murdochii under high-stringency conditions. the location of hlya on the chromosomal map was distinct from the locations of tlya,  tlyb, and tlyc.

TI  == prevalence of intestinal pathogens in danish finishing pig herds.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of the intestinal bacteria: lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira hyodysenteriae, serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira pilosicoli, pathogenic escherichia coli (serogroups o138, o139, o141 and o149) and salmonella enterica in danish finishing pig herds. a total of 79 herds was randomly selected and visited during 1998. from each herd,  20 faecal samples were collected from individual pigs weighing 30-50kg. furthermore, 10 pooled pen samples were collected and examined for s. enterica. in total, 1580 faecal samples and 790 pen samples were collected and examined by  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) or culture. l. intracellularis was found in 74 herds (93.7%), b. hyodysenteriae in two herds (2.5%), s. intermedia in 10 herds (12. 7%), b. innocens in 27 herds (34.2%), b. pilosicoli in 15 herds (19. 0%), pathogenic e. coli in 19 herds (24.1%) and s. enterica in eight herds (10.1%). the within-herd prevalences of l. intracellularis and b. hyodysenteriae were 25-30%; the within-herd prevalences of the other agents were 5-10%. three herds (4%) were not infected with any of the bacteria and 25 herds (32%) were only infected with l. intracellularis.

TI  == cloning and dna sequence analysis of an immunogenic glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein homologue from brachyspira pilosicoli, the agent of colonic spirochetosis.
AB  == colonic spirochetosis (cs) is a newly emerging infectious disease of humans and animals caused by the pathogenic spirochete brachyspira (formerly serpulina) pilosicoli. the purpose of this study was to characterize an antigen that was recognized by antibodies present in sera of challenge-exposed pigs. the gene encoding the antigen was identified by screening a plasmid library of human b. pilosicoli strain sp16 (atcc 49776) genomic dna with hyperimmune and convalescent swine sera. the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cloned b. pilosicoli gene had a high degree of similarity and identity to glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein. located 106 bp downstream of the putative mglb gene was a 3'-truncated open reading frame with 73.8% similarity and 66.3% identity to mgla  of escherichia coli, suggesting a gene arrangement within an operon which is similar to those of other bacteria. a single copy of the gene was present in b. pilosicoli, and homologous sequences were widely conserved among porcine intestinal spirochetes serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira murdochii, and the avian brachyspira alvinipulli, but not in porcine brachyspira  hyodysenteriae, human brachyspira aalborgi, and porcine treponema succinifaciens. the deduced molecular weight of the mature mglb lipoprotein was consistent with expression by the cloned gene of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight  of 36,000, as determined by western blot analysis and [(3)h]palmitate labeling. because mucin is the principal constituent of the colonic mucus gel and consists  of glycoproteins that can serve as the substrate for growth and chemotaxis of b.  pilosicoli in vitro, a role for mglb in mucosal localization of the spirochete appears consistent with the pathogenesis of cs. however, the presence of homologous sequences in closely related but nonpathogenic commensal spirochetes suggests that other virulence determinants may be required for pathogenesis.

TI  == comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  == enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. the most common etiological agents include escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, lawsonia intracellularis, salmonella enterica, and brachyspira (serpulina) spp. with the exception of brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine  dysentery, and lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy,  the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic e. coli and c. perfringens type a), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic e. coli and brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with s. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain c. perfringens. extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of e. coli and most serotypes of s. enterica. enteric bacterial diseases of swine have  been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.

TI  == characterization of a periplasmic atp-binding cassette iron import system of brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the pathogenic spirochete brachyspira hyodysenteriae bit (for "brachyspira iron transport") genomic region has been determined. the bit region is likely to encode an iron atp-binding cassette transport system with some homology to those encountered in gram-negative bacteria. six open reading frames oriented in the same direction and physically linked have been identified. this system possesses a protein containing atp-binding motifs (bitd), two hydrophobic cytoplasmic membrane permeases (bite and bitf), and at least three lipoproteins (bita, bitb, and bitc) with homology to iron periplasmic binding proteins. these periplasmic binding proteins exhibit lipoprotein features. they are labeled by [(3)h]palmitate when tested in recombinant escherichia coli, and their signal peptides are typical for substrates of the type ii secretory peptidase. the furta system and congo red assay indicate that bitb and bitc are involved in iron binding. the bit system is detected only in b. hyodysenteriae and is absent from b. innocens and b. pilosicoli.

TI  == identification of a gene sequence encoding a putative pyruvate oxidoreductase in  serpulina pilosicoli.
AB  == serpulina pilosicoli is a recently described species of intestinal spirochaete which can be identified using a species-specific monoclonal antibody bjl/ac1 reactive with a 29-kda protein located in the cell envelope. a genomic library of the type strain of s. pilosicoli p43/6/78t was created in lambda zap express and  screened using bjl/ac1. single positive clones were isolated and excised into the phagemid vector pbk-cmv. phagemid dna was purified and a single clone was selected for sequencing. the size of spirochaetal dna insert was determined by digestion with restriction endonucleases ecori and psti as being approximately 2.6 kb. the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the protein with which the antibody reacted was determined by cycle sequencing. the insert contained an open reading frame of 285 nucleotides. translation of the nucleotide sequence into amino acid (aa) residues showed a sequence of 275 aa. comparison of this sequence with databases revealed homology to pyruvate oxidoreductases from various organisms found in the gastroinestinal tract. these included the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por) alpha submit of helicobacter pylori (38.8% identity in 250 aa), pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase of escherichia coli (28.7% identify in 258 aa) and giardia intestinalis (25.1% identity in 251 aa). a significant level of homology was also observed with hyperthermophilic bacteria such as the por of thermatoga maritima (38.6% in 254 aa) and the 2-ketovalerate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase of pyrococcus furiosus (34% in 262 aa).

TI  == examination of serpulina pilosicoli for attachment and invasion determinants of enterobacteria.
AB  == the spirochaete, serpulina pilosicoli, is the agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, a diarrhoeal disease of humans and other species. by mechanisms as yet unknown, large numbers of these spirochaetes intimately attach to the colonic mucosa by one cell end. in some infected individuals, the spirochaetes may invade the lamina propria and adjacent tissues, and they may cause spirochaetaemia. to examine s. pilosicoli for pathogenic determinants homologous with enterobacteria, dna was extracted from six strains of s. pilosicoli and hybridised at low stringency with dna probes derived from the inv, ail and yada genes of yersinia enterocolitica, the eae gene from enteropathogenic escherichia coli and a probe derived from the virulence plasmid of shigella flexneri. no hybridisation of the  enterobacterial probes to s. pilosicoli dna was detected, indicating that these gene sequences, which are known to be involved in the attachment and invasion processes of the other intestinal pathogens, were not present in the spirochaetes.

TI  == detection of lawsonia intracellularis, serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes, salmonella enterica, and haemolytic escherichia coli from swine herds with and without diarrhoea among growing pigs.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was optimized to detect lawsonia intracellularis in faeces from naturally infected pigs. by combining a boiling procedure to extract dna and a nested pcr procedure, a detection limit at 2 x 10(2) bacterial cells per gram of faeces was achieved. the optimized pcr was used together with conventional culture techniques to detect serpulina hyodysenteriae, weakly beta-haemolytic intestinal spirochaetes (wbhis), salmonella enterica, and  haemolytic escherichia coli, in a case control study to examine selected risk factors for the development of diarrhoea in growing pigs. herds with diarrhoea were selected as cases and randomly chosen herds without diarrhoea were chosen as controls. infection with l. intracellularis significantly enhanced the chance of  diarrhoea. s. hyodysenteriae, wbhis group iv (serpulina pilosicoli), and s. enterica were isolated only from case herds which indicate that these species may influence the development of diarrhoea. in addition, herd-type had a significant  impact, that is specific pathogen-free herds showed an odds ratio at 0.2 relative to conventional herds for the development of diarrhoea.

TI  == identification of serpulina species associated with porcine colitis by biochemical analysis and pcr.
AB  == a pcr system for the detection and identification of group iv spirochetes (serpulina pilosicoli) was designed to complement biochemical tests, e.g., the hippurate hydrolysis and beta-glucosidase tests, and to verify the accuracy of a  previously proposed biochemical classification system. the pcr assay was based on amplification of a segment of the 16s rrna gene. both primers were constructed to selectively amplify the 16s rrna gene of serpulina pilosicoli. all analyzed serpulina strains exhibiting the capacity to hydrolyze hippurate and lacking beta-glucosidase activity, including the type strain for spirochetal diarrhea, p43, were amplified with the pcr system. all other tested strains, including type and field strains of different phenotypes of serpulina species, as well as salmonella species, campylobacter species, and escherichia coli strains, were negative in the assay. among the tested strains were 18 scottish field isolates originating from the mucosae of pigs with colitis. a simple classification scheme, suitable for routine classification of porcine intestinal spirochetes, is also presented. the scheme is based on hemolysis, indole production, and the hippurate hydrolysis test.
