TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Impact of cyadox on human colonic microflora in chemostat models.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological safety of cyadox, a new member of quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides (QdNOs), on human intestinal flora. Four chemostats containing human fecal flora were exposed to 0, 16, 32, and 128 mug/mL of cyadox, respectively. Bacterial populations, resistance rates of two predominant bacteria and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were monitored daily prior to and during drug MOA Laboratory of Risk Assessment for Quality and Safety of Livestock and Poultry Products exposure. Colonization resistance (CR) of each community was determined by three successive daily challenges of Salmonella typhimurium. Efflux pump gene (oqxAB) in the Escherichia coli and Enterococcus strains were analyzed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. No change in SCFA was observed after exposure to different concentrations of cyadox. Lower concentration of cyadox (16 mug/mL) had no adverse effect on human microflora. However, higher concentrations of cyadox (32 and 128 mug/mL) could change bacterial population and increase the proportion of resistant E. coli and Enterococcus. More than 26% (12/46) of cyadox resistant E. coli strains contained oqxAB gene, while all the resistant Enterococcus were negative to oqxAB gene. Relationship between the occurrence of oqxAB gene and cyadox exposure is inconclusive. Our data indicated that 16 mug/mL might be the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of cyadox. Derived microbiological acceptable daily intake (mADI) would be 1552.03 mug/kg d. The data obtained in present study indicated that cyadox was a safe member of QdNOs family of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Analysis of the intestinal microbiota of oligosaccharide fed mice exhibiting reduced resistance to Salmonella infection.
AB  - Certain indigestible carbohydrates, known as prebiotics, are claimed to be beneficial for gut health through a selective stimulation of certain gut microbes including bifidobacteria. However, stimulation of such microbes does not necessarily imply a preventive effect against pathogen infection. We recently demonstrated a reduced resistance to Salmonella infection in mice fed diets containing fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS). In the present study, faecal and caecal samples from the same mice were analysed in order to study microbial changes potentially explaining the observed effects on the pathogenesis of Salmonella. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that the microbiota in faecal samples from mice fed FOS or XOS were different from faecal samples collected before the feeding trial as well as from faecal profiles generated from control animals. This difference was not seen for caecal profiles. Further analysis of faecal samples by real-time PCR demonstrated a significant increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum, the Bacteroides fragilis group and in Bifidobacterium spp. in mice fed FOS or XOS. The observed bifidogenic effect was more pronounced for XOS than for FOS. The Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridium coccoides group were reduced by both FOS and XOS. Surprisingly, no significant differences were detected between faecal samples collected before and after pathogen challenge in any of the groups. Furthermore, no effect of diets on caecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids was recorded. In conclusion, diets supplemented with FOS or XOS induced a number of microbial changes in the faecal microbiota of mice. The observed effects of XOS were qualitatively similar to those of FOS, but the most prominent bifidogenic effect was seen for XOS. An increased level of bifidobacteria is thus not in itself preventive against Salmonella infection, since the same XOS or FOS-fed mice were previously reported to be more severely affected by Salmonella than control animals.
TI  - Dietary glycosaminoglycans interfere in bacterial adhesion and gliadin-induced pro-inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells.
AB  - Dietary components may have an important role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiota composition. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of Bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Listeria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (10(8) CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1beta, but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha. The results suggest that GAGs may ameliorate gliadin-induced inflammatory response, though they also slightly interfere with the action of B. longum.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Enumeration of bacteriophages in water by different laboratories of the European  Union in two interlaboratory comparison studies.
AB  - As part of a European project on bacteriophages in bathing waters two interlaboratory comparison studies were carried out (May 1997 and March 1998). During these studies phage reference materials as well as naturally polluted standard samples were analysed in 16 European laboratories. Three groups of bacteriophages were tested using standardised methods: somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA-phages and phages of Bacteroides fragilis. Many of the participating laboratories applied one or more of the phage methods for the first time, after a one-week training session in a central laboratory. Nevertheless, the values of repeatability (r=1.35-1.38 calculated on log(10)-scale) and reproducibility (R=1.52-2.04 calculated on log(10)-scale) when analysing phage reference materials were close to the theoretical optimum for a Poisson distribution. When analysing the naturally polluted samples more variation in results within and between laboratories was found (r=1.63-2.34; R=3.10-5.72), in comparison with the results obtained with the pure phage reference materials.
TI  - Activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. METHODS: The MICs were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. RESULTS: Faropenem was very active against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 Staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 Bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/L for inhibition. Of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a Bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem MIC higher than that associated with the other isolates of the same species. CONCLUSIONS: Faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. There was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin and faropenem or imipenem resistance.
TI  - Multiple inverted DNA repeats of Bacteroides fragilis that control polysaccharide antigenic variation are similar to the hin region inverted repeats of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The important opportunistic pathogen Bacteroides fragilis is a strictly anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the normal resident human gastrointestinal microbiota. Our earlier studies indicated that there is considerable within-strain variation in polysaccharide expression, as detected by mAb labelling. Analysis of the genome sequence has revealed multiple invertible DNA regions, designated fragilis invertible (fin) regions, seven of which are upstream of polysaccharide biosynthesis loci and are approximately 226 bp in size. Using orientation-specific PCR primers and sequence analysis with populations enriched for one antigenic type, two of these invertible regions were assigned to heteropolymeric polysaccharides with different sizes of repeating units, as determined by PAGE pattern. The implication of these findings is that inversion of the fin regions switches biosynthesis of these polysaccharides off and on. The invertible regions are bound by inverted repeats of 30 or 32 bp with striking similarity to the Salmonella typhimurium H flagellar antigen inversion cross-over (hix) recombination sites of the invertible hin region. It has been demonstrated that a plasmid-encoded Hin invertase homologue (FinB), present in B. fragilis NCTC 9343, binds specifically to the invertible regions and the recombination sites have been designated as fragilis inversion cross-over (fix) sites.
TI  - Role of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpCF) gene in oxidative stress defense of the obligate Anaerobe bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - In this study we report the identification and role of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahp) gene in Bacteroides fragilis. The two components of ahp, ahpC, and ahpF, are organized in an operon, and the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that B. fragilis AhpCF shares approximately 60% identity to orthologues in other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Northern blot hybridization analysis of total RNA showed that the ahpCF genes were transcribed as a polycistronic 2.4-kb mRNA and that ahpC also was present as a 0.6-kb monocistronic mRNA. ahpC and ahpCF mRNAs were induced approximately 60-fold following H(2)O(2) treatment or oxygen exposure of the parent strain but were constitutive in a peroxide-resistant strain. Further investigation using an ahpCF'::beta-xylosidase gene transcriptional fusion confirmed that ahpCF had lost normal regulation in the peroxide-resistant strain compared to the parent. The ahpCF mutant was more sensitive to growth inhibition and mutagenesis by organic peroxides than the parent strain, as determined by disk inhibition assays and the frequency of mutation to fusidic acid resistance. This finding suggests that the ahp genes play an important role in peroxide resistance in B. fragilis. Under anaerobic conditions, we observed increases in the number of spontaneous fusidic acid-resistant mutants of five- and sevenfold in ahpCF and ahpF strain backgrounds, respectively, and eightfold in the ahpCF katB double mutant strain compared to the parent and katB strains. In addition, ahpCF, ahpF, and ahpCF katB mutants were slightly more sensitive to oxygen exposure than the parent strain. Moreover, the isolation of a strain with enhanced aerotolerance and high-level resistance to alkyl hydroperoxides from an ahpCF katB parent suggests that the physiological responses to peroxide toxicity and to the toxic effects of molecular oxygen are overlapping and complex in this obligate anaerobe.
TI  - Induction of oxidative DNA damage in anaerobes.
AB  - We compared oxidative DNA damage in strictly anaerobic Prevotella melaninogenica, aerotolerant anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis, and facultative anaerobic Salmonella typhimurium after exposure to O2 or H2O2. Using HPLC with electrochemical detection, we measured 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) as a damage marker. O2 induced 8OHdG in P. melaninogenica but not in B. fragilis, which shows catalase activity, or in S. typhimurium. In P. melaninogenica, with catalase, O2 induced less 8OHdG; superoxide dismutase had no effect; with glucose and glucose oxidase, O2 induced more 8OHdG. H2O2 also markedly increased 8OHdG. O2 was suggested to induce 8OHdG through H2O2. O2 or H2O2 decreased survival only in P. melaninogenica. Highly sensitive to oxidative stress, P. melaninogenica could prove useful for investigating oxidative DNA damage.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus equuli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming U/mL. Synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or Columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. Then aliquots were removed for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial DNA corresponding to a region of the 16S ribosomal gene. Duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. Bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. Under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and PCR analyses for detection of bacteria. Experimentally, PCR was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.
TI  - Comparison of cytokine induction by lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis with Salmonella typhimurium in mice.
AB  - Comparison of cytokine stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella typhimurium was done to study the early events occurring in vivo. Mice injected intraperitoneally with either LPS demonstrated endogenous production of all the cytokines studied (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma and interleukin-6) within 6 hr in the bloodstream. However induction of all the cytokines by B. fragilis LPS (50 micrograms/mouse) was much weaker compared with S. typhimurium LPS (50 micrograms/mouse). Even a dose of S. typhimurium LPS 40 times smaller (1.2 micrograms/mouse) induced cytokines more strongly compared with B. fragilis LPS. Thus, a weak biological response to B. fragilis LPS as evidenced by chick embryo lethality, limulus lysate gelation, LD50 for mice and rabbit pyrogenicity could be due to weak induction of bioactive mediators by LPS.
TI  - Structural features of polysaccharides that induce intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide complex from Bacteroides fragilis promotes the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses--a pathologic host response to infecting microorganisms. This complex consists of two distinct polysaccharides, each with repeating units that have positively charged amino groups and negatively charged carboxyl or phosphate groups. Analysis of these polysaccharides as well as other charged carbohydrates before and after chemical modification revealed that these oppositely charged groups are required for the induction of intra-abdominal abscesses in a rat model.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and distribution of the Salmonella typhimurium LT2 sialidase  gene, nanH, provides evidence for interspecies gene transfer.
AB  - The Salmonella typhimurium LT2 sialidase (neuraminidase, EC 3.2.1.18) structural  gene, nanH, has been cloned and sialidase overproduced from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli. Sialidase expression was regulated positively by cAMP. In contrast, certain Tn1000 insertions located upstream of nanH coding sequences reduced sialidase activity. A nanH chromosomal insertion mutation constructed by marker exchange demonstrated a single sialidase gene copy in S. typhimurium LT2. The complete nucleotide sequence of nanH, encoding a 41,300 dalton polypeptide, was determined and the derived primary structure was similar to sialidases from Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sordellii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Comparative sequence analysis, including codon usage and secondary structure predictions, indicated that the S. typhimurium and clostridial sialidases are homologous, strongly suggestive of an interspecies gene transfer event. At least two primary sequence motifs of the bacterial enzymes were detected in influenza A virus sialidases. The predicted secondary structure of the bacterial enzymes was strikingly similar to viral sialidase. From the population distribution of nanH detected within a collection of salmonellae, it was apparent that S. typhimurium obtained its nanH copy most recently from Salmonella arizonae. S. typhimurium LT2 is thus a genetic mosaic that differs from other strains of even the same serotype by nanH plus potentially additional characters linked to nanH. These results have relevance to the evolution and function of sialidases in pathogenic microbes, and to the origin of the sialic acids.
TI  - Transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents and cell surface hydrophobicity in Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents, e.g. lincomycin  and clindamycin, was examined in Bacteroides fragilis which is sensitive to these agents. The results showed that these agents penetrate efficiently through the outer membrane. Cell surface hydrophobicity measured by the partition assay between water and p-xylene revealed that the cell surface of B. fragilis is more hydrophobic than that of Salmonella typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, treatment with low concentrations of surfactant caused cell lysis. These results suggest that the cell surface hydrophobicity in B. fragilis plays an important role in the efficient transmembrane penetration of hydrophobic compounds. This efficiency explains the susceptibility of B. fragilis to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Primary abscess of the psoas].
AB  - We present in this paper a series of cases from our Service of primary abscesses  in psoas. We consider the appearance of immunosuppressed patients as a relevant factor of its etiopathogenicity. We believe that a C.A.T. is the best diagnostic method. All three patients that underwent open surgery have had complications. The patients treated with percutaneous puncture has shown a favourable evolution.
TI  - Correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  - Infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. In-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the MIC and tissue levels generally above the MIC at time of challenge and during the course of infection. The efficacy of azithromycin against a Salmonella enteritidis oral challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. The significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. Ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). In another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized Staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. Extravascular fluid levels of azithromycin were greater than the MIC of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the MIC at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. Serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the MIC at the time of challenge. The antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of Staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, P less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. The significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with Escherichia coli or a mixture of Staph. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Antibody responses to Escherichia coli J5 lipopolysaccharide and to Salmonella porin in patients with bacteremia.
AB  - This study was undertaken in order to evaluate whether patients with bacteremia respond with antibodies directed towards two outer membrane components of Gram-negative bacteria. The antibody responses to the core of the lipopolysaccharide molecule (LPS) of the rough E. coli J5 mutant and to a purified outer membrane protein (porin) from Salmonella were studied in bacteremic patients. Two or three serum samples were consecutively collected from 77 patients having 82 episodes of bacteremia altogether, of these 50 were caused by bacteria of the genus Enterobacteriaceae. As controls, sera from 82 age and sex matched patients and 100 healthy blood donors were analysed. The antibody titers were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). None of the patients with bacteremia responded with an increase in antibody level to the E. coli J5 rough LPS. This finding indicates that the core portion of the E. coli J5 LPS contains no antigenic epitopes immunologically cross-reactive with Gram-negative bacteria causing bacteremia. By contrast, 13 patients showed significant titer increases to the porin preparation derived from Salmonella. Twelve of these patients had bacteremia caused by Gram-negative organisms belonging to Enterobacteriaceae. One patient had bacteremia with Bacteroides fragilis but also suffered from a severe peritonitis with growth of both E. coli and Klebsiella. It is suggested that the measurement of antibody response to porin may be of value for differential serological diagnosis in patients with bacteremia, to distinguish between Enterobacteriaceae and other organisms.
TI  - Fecal mutagens and Bacteroides fragilis levels in the feces of dimethylhydrazine-treated rats: influence of diet.
AB  - In a study designed to investigate the effects of dietary synergisms on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced rat colon carcinogenesis, fecal pellets were examined for the presence of direct-acting fecal mutagens and levels of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms. Intraperitoneal injections of DMH at 10 mg/kg were given for 16 weeks (weeks 3-18) to 160 male F344 rats consuming 4 supplemental dietary factors in all possible combinations. The dietary factors examined were wheat bran (15%), cholesterol (1%), beef tallow (18%) and indole-3-carbinol (IC) (0.1%). Feces were collected 3, 10, 17, 24 and 31 weeks after commencing the dietary treatments and dichloromethane extracts were assayed using the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 without metabolic activation. The numbers of B. fragilis group organisms were enumerated in feces collected at the same time. Most feces samples were negative for mutagens but extracts from weeks 17-31 showed a significant mutagenic response from the IC factor in the diet. The fecal levels of B. fragilis were significantly increased by the inclusion of cholesterol in the diets. The B. fragilis counts and fecal mutagen production were not correlated (r = 0.09), although species of the B. fragilis group have been implicated in the production on human fecal mutagens.
TI  - Therapeutic activities of nitrothiazole derivatives in experimental infections with Salmonella typhimurium and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of niridazole (AmbilharR) and 12 other newly synthesized nitrothiazole derivatives were examined. Most of these compounds were active in vitro against Salmonella typhimurium (MICs 1-4 mg/l) and Bacteroides fragilis (MICs 0.015-0.03 mg/l). A therapeutic effect as determined by a reduction of bacterial counts per spleen of mice infected with Salm. typhimurium could only be achieved with those agents which displayed a similar side chain as niridazole, i.e. an imidazolidinone ring. Other nitrothiazole derivatives with a cleaved imidazolidinone ring as the side chain, although active in vitro, could not exert a reduction of bacterial counts in vivo. Similar results were obtained in mice infected with Bact. fragilis. Whereas niridazole and another nitrothiazole derivative with an imidazolidinone ring in the side chain were able to reduce the bacterial counts in a subcutaneous abscess, the derivative with a laminar side chain was inactive in vivo, although highly active in vitro.
TI  - Neonatal septicemia in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Twenty-nine cases of neonatal septicemia from Saudi Arabia are described. A high  incidence of prematurity (45%) and congenital malformations (45%) were found as predisposing factors. The mortality was 45%, mainly due to severe malformations and late referrals. Thirty-one percent of the cases grew Salmonella enteritidis species and one case of Bacteroides fragilis septicemia and meningitis is reported. Only two of the organisms isolated were sensitive to ampicillin. The importance of doing studies on neonatal septicemia on a local basis is stressed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of Salmonella typhi. Piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. The relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. In addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. This investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. S. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. Inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) CFU, and inocula of 10(2) CFU resulted in MICs and MBCs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) CFU. Piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. Combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against Pseudomonas and Serratia isolates. Less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against Klebsiella and indole-positive Proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. Occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
TI  - Various lipopolysaccharides reduce adhesion of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  - The interaction of LPS from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and lipid A from S. typhimurium with adhesion of human periodontal cells on plastic surfaces has been studied. The results showed that LPS and lipid A reduced adhesion already after 5 min at concentrations from 5 to 200 microgram/ml without influencing cell viability. It could be demonstrated that LPS and lipid A interact with both the cell and the substratum surface. Lipid A from S. typhimurium was more potent than any of the LPS used.
TI  - The anaerobe-mediated mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene and 2-aminofluorene for Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, B vulgatus, and B thetaiotaomicron) possess the enzymic ability to convert 2-nitrofluorene and 2-aminofluorene to substances mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium. If it be assumed that the active intermediate for both chemicals is 2-hydroxylaminofluorene, then these bacteria possess reductive as well as oxidative capabilities.
TI  - Endotoxins of anaerobic gram-negative rods.
AB  - Endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from Fusobacterium are similar to those of Salmonella with respect to chemical composition, O-antigenic specificity and endotoxic activity. Bacteroides LPS are highly atypical with respect to the chemical composition, and their endotoxic activity is low. O-Antigenic specificity is present. B. fragilis LPS is chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro and in vivo. The chemotactic activity is brought about by activation of the alternative complement pathway.
TI  - Properties of the Ames Salmonella mutants lodged in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - An association of the histidine auxotroph of Salmonella typhimurium (strain TA1538) within the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germ-free Sprague-Dawley rats is maintained during observations for up to 7 months. The bacteria exceed concentrations of 10(7)/g in the forestomach and exceed concentrations of 10(8)/g in the lower bowel and feces. When carcinogens are ingested, the number of revertants in the feces increases. The ingestion of structurally related compounds which are not mutagenic to the bacteria in vitro and for which no evidence of carcinogenicity exists does not increase the number of revertants in the feces. The numbers of salmonella are increased by the addition of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacteroides fragilis but the salmonella disappear from the gastrointestinal tract when the rats are conventionalized. With the additional flora, there is a decrease in the number of revertants appearing in the feces in response to a given dose of carcinogen. This decrease may reflect an effect of the flora on the activity of the metabolic pathway responsible for the presence of the ultimate carcinogen or it may simply be an effect on the salmonella mutants themselves.
TI  - Effect of some bacterial products on platelet electrophoretic mobility (PEM).
AB  - Bacterial LPS, used in our experiments, are able to decrease PEM at concentration of 100 microgram/ml after incubation with 1 X 10(7) platelets/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Such effect is statistically significant for Bacteroides fragilis LPS, S. enteritidis and S. typhi. E. coli LPS 026:B6 W and E. coli 055:B5 W are not effective at all, S. minnesota (incomplete) LPS 595 and 345 free of 0-polysaccharide and partially lacking core in their molecule did not influence PEM, while S. minnesota LPS (S form) (a complete LPS) strongly decreased PEM. This fact could suggest that 0-polysaccharide is involved in this inhibitory effect on PEM. Klebsiella enterotoxin and B. cereus enterotoxin are able to decrease PEM at concentration of 100 microgram/ml, after incubation with 1 X 10(7) platelets for 30 min at 37 degrees C, while no inhibition of PEM was seen when Shighella enterotoxin and V. parahaemoliticus enterotoxin was used in similar way. The AA. conclude that endotoxin and enterotoxin are able to change the electrokinetic charge (negative) of platelets, thereby, causing a decrease of PEM.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - Bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The effects of Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium mortiferum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of Escherichia coli and Salmonella minnesota, wild type and R595. Intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid A of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of coagulation. Lipopolysaccharide and lipid A of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause aggregation of human platelets in vitro. Washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid A of Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and C6-deficient rabbit plasma. Lipid A, but not lipopolysaccharide, of E. coli and washed cells of S. minnesota R595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. These results indicated that Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets or terminal components of complement.
