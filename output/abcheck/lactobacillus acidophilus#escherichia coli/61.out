antimicrobial activity of sesbania grandiflora flower polyphenol extracts on some pathogenic bacteria and growth stimulatory effect on the probiotic organism lactobacillus acidophilus.
polyphenolic extracts (pe) of edible flower of sesbania grandiflora were tested to evaluate its antimicrobial effect against some common pathogenic bacteria and growth promoting property against probiotic organism lactobacillus acidophilus.
the antimicrobial activity of s. grandiflora flower pe against selected pathogens was evaluated using both in vitro and in situ methods. in vitro studies suggested that pe has inhibitory effect against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri 2a, salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae.
the gram-positive organism s. aureus was the most sensitive organism to pe and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was found to be 0.013 mg/ml where as the mic of pe against v. cholerae was the highest (0.25 mg/ml). on the other hand pe showed growth promoting effect on the common probiotic bacterium l. acidophilus.
the major finding was that s. grandiflora pe induced a significant biomass increase of l. acidophilus grown in liquid culture media.
pe showed reduction of s. aureus growth in food (fish) during storage at 10 degrees c. high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that rutin, a major flavonoid of the pe diminished in the culture medium mrs broth with the growth of l. acidophilus.
