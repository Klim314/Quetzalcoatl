TI  == reduced burden of salmonella enterica in bovine subiliac lymph nodes associated with administration of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  == despite effective food safety interventions within abattoirs, salmonella enterica remains a common contaminant of raw ground beef. research has recently implicated peripheral lymph nodes (plns) as a potential route by which salmonella contaminates ground beef. this study examined the efficacy of using lactobacillus animalis (formerly designated lactobacillus acidophilus; np51) and propionibacterium freudenreichii (np24), at 109 cfu/head/day, as a direct-fed microbial (dfm) in feedlot cattle diets to control salmonella within plns. two studies were conducted in which cattle were randomly allocated into either control or dfm treatment groups. diets of treated cattle were supplemented with 109 cfu/head/day of the dfm, while control groups received no dfm supplementation. during slaughter at abattoirs, one subiliac lymph node (sln) per carcass was collected from 627 carcasses from one study and 99 carcasses from the second study. lymph nodes were cultured to estimate the presence and concentration of salmonella. in the first study, effects of dfm supplementation varied across slaughter days. on the first and second slaughter days, prevalence  was reduced by 50% (p = 0.0072) and 31% (p = 0.0093), respectively. no significant difference was observed on slaughter day three (p = 0.1766). in the second study, salmonella was 82% less likely (p = 0.008) to be recovered from slns of treatment cattle. while a greater relative risk reduction was observed in the latter study, absolute risk reductions were similar across studies. a significant reduction in the concentration of salmonella in slns (p < 0.0001) on  a cfu/g and cfu/node basis was also observed in cattle administered np51 and np24 in the first study; in the second study, too few quantifiable slns were observed  to facilitate meaningful comparisons. the results indicate that np51 and np24 supplementation may aid in reducing the prevalence and concentration of salmonella in slns and, therefore, serve as an effective control measure to reduce salmonella in ground beef products.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == gastrointestinal microbes interact with canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and enhance immunomodulatory functions.
AB  == mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) are somatic, multipotent stromal cells with potent  immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. although mscs have pattern recognition receptors and are modulated by toll-like receptor ligands, msc-microbial interactions are poorly defined. the objectives of this study were  to determine the effect of bacterial association on msc function. we hypothesized that gastrointestinal bacteria associate with mscs and alter their immunomodulatory properties. the effect of msc-microbial interactions on msc morphology, viability, proliferation, migration, and immunomodulatory functions was investigated. mscs associated with a remarkable array of enteric pathogens and commensal bacteria. msc interactions with two model organisms, the pathogen salmonella typhimurium and the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, were further  investigated. while st readily invaded mscs, lb adhered to the msc plasma membrane. neither microbe induced msc death, degeneration, or diminished proliferation. microbial association did not upregulate mhc-ii, cd80/86, or cd1 expression. msc-microbial interaction significantly increased transcription of key immunomodulatory genes, including cox2, il6, and il8, coupled with significantly increased prostaglandin e2 (pge2), interleukin (il)6, and il8 secretion. msc-st coincubation resulted in increased msc expression of cd54, and  significant augmentation of msc inhibition of mitogen-induced t-cell proliferation. t-cell proliferation was partially restored when pge2 secretion was blocked from st-primed mscs. msc-microbe interactions have a profound effect  on msc function and may be pivotal in a variety of clinical settings where mscs are being explored as potential therapeutics in the context of microbial communities, such as crohn's disease, chronic nonhealing wounds, and sepsis.

TI  == yerba mate enhances probiotic bacteria growth in vitro but as a feed additive does not reduce salmonella enteritidis colonization in vivo.
AB  == yerba mate (ilex paraguariensis) is a tea known to have beneficial effects on human health and antimicrobial activity against some foodborne pathogens. thus, the application of yerba mate as a feed additive for broiler chickens to reduce salmonella colonization was evaluated. the first in vitro evaluation was conducted by suspending salmonella enteritidis and lactic acid bacteria (lab) in  yerba mate extract. the in vivo evaluations were conducted using preventative and horizontal transmission experiments. in all experiments, day-of-hatch chicks were treated with one of the following 1) no treatment (control); 2) ground yerba mate in feed; 3) probiotic treatment (lactobacillus acidophilus and pediococcus; 9:1 administered once on day of hatch by gavage); or 4) both yerba mate and probiotic treatments. at d 3, all chicks were challenged with salmonella enteritidis (preventative experiment) or 5 of 20 chicks (horizontal transmission experiment). at d 10, all birds were euthanized, weighed, and cecal contents enumerated for salmonella. for the in vitro evaluation, antimicrobial activity was observed against salmonella and the same treatment enhanced growth of lab. for in vivo evaluations, none of the yerba mate treatments significantly reduced salmonella enteritidis colonization, whereas the probiotic treatment significantly reduced salmonella colonization in the horizontal transmission experiment. yerba mate decreased chicken bw and decreased the performance of the probiotic treatment when used in combination. in conclusion, yerba mate had antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens and enhanced the growth of lab in vitro, but in vivo  yerba mate did not decrease salmonella enteritidis colonization.

TI  == antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus la10 against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis se86 in mice.
AB  == salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis is one of the main pathogens responsible  for foodborne illness in brazil. probiotic bacteria can play a role in defense and recovery from enteropathogenic infections. in this study, the ability of lactobacillus acidophilus la10 to colonise and exert antagonistic effects in the  gastrointestinal tract was tested before and during experimental infection in conventional mice contaminated with s. enteritidis (se86). a dose of 0.1 ml containing 10(8) viable cells of se86 and l. acidophilus la10 was orally administered by gavage to mice. the experiment was divided into groups. as a negative control, group 1 was administered only sterile saline solution. as a positive control, group 2 was administered only se86. group 3 was first administered se86, and after 10 days, treated with l. acidophilus la10. group 4 was first administered l. acidophilus la10, and after 10 days, challenged with se86. the results demonstrated that a significant number of se86 cells were able  to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of mice, specifically in the colon and ileum. l. acidophilus la10 demonstrated an antagonistic effect against se86, with better results observed for group 3 over group 4. thus, l. acidophilus la10 shows potential antagonistic effects against s. enteritidis se86, especially if administered after infection.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == a pdms/paper/glass hybrid microfluidic biochip integrated with aptamer-functionalized graphene oxide nano-biosensors for one-step multiplexed pathogen detection.
AB  == infectious pathogens often cause serious public health concerns throughout the world. there is an increasing demand for simple, rapid and sensitive approaches for multiplexed pathogen detection. in this paper we have developed a polydimethylsiloxane (pdms)/paper/glass hybrid microfluidic system integrated with aptamer-functionalized graphene oxide (go) nano-biosensors for simple, one-step, multiplexed pathogen detection. the paper substrate used in this hybrid microfluidic system facilitated the integration of aptamer biosensors on the microfluidic biochip, and avoided complicated surface treatment and aptamer probe immobilization in a pdms or glass-only microfluidic system. lactobacillus acidophilus was used as a bacterium model to develop the microfluidic platform with a detection limit of 11.0 cfu ml(-1). we have also successfully extended this method to the simultaneous detection of two infectious pathogens - staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica. this method is simple and fast. the one-step 'turn on' pathogen assay in a ready-to-use microfluidic device only  takes ~10 min to complete on the biochip. furthermore, this microfluidic device has great potential in rapid detection of a wide variety of different other bacterial and viral pathogens.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of salmonella enteritidis after hatch.
AB  == the protection level against salmonella enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, and control. on d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml of inoculum  in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. two days after hatching, 0.5 ml of salmonella enteritidis culture was  inoculated by the intraesophageal route. on d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain salmonella enteritidis counts. there was no decrease in salmonella enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in  ovo, in relation to salmonella enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus kacc 12419, lact. casei kacc 12413, lact. paracasei kacc 12427 and lact. rhamnosus kacc 11953) and  pathogens (salmonella typhimurium kccm 40253 and listeria monocytogenes kacc 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. the highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), lact. casei (17.2%) and lact. acidophilus (15.1%). salm. typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. the numbers of l. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus. the results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == factors affecting adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to caco-2 cells and inhibitory effect on infection of salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == in this study, seven strains isolated from mustard leaf kimchi were screened for  their tolerance to simulated gastric and bile juices, the adhesive properties to  caco-2 cells, and the inhibition ability of salmonella typhimurium atcc 29631 adhesion. lactobacillus acidophilus gk20, lactobacillus paracasei gk74, and lactobacillus plantarum gk81, which were resistant to bile as well as gastric juices, possessed high bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) activity towards both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate. the strongest in vitro adherence of 53.96 +/- 4.49% was exhibited by l. plantarum gk81 followed by l. acidophilus gk20 with adhesion levels of 40.72 +/- 9.46%. the adhesion of these strains was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after exposure to pepsin and heating for 30 min  at 80 degrees c. addition of ca2+ led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase of the adhesion of l. acidophilus gk20, but the adhesion ability of l. plantarum gk81 was not different from the control by the addition of calcium. in the competition and exclusion experiment, the adhesion inhibition of s. typhimurium by l. plantarum gk81 strain was much higher than the other strains. moreover, the exclusion inhibition of s. typhimurium by l. acidophilus gk20 was considerably high, although the inhibition activity of this strain was lower than l. plantarum gk81.

TI  == comparative study of the protective capacity against salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to investigate the immunoprotective ability of three lactobacilli strains against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in a mouse model. to identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this  pathogen. methods and results: the immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: lactobacillus (lact.) casei crl 431 (probiotic bacterium),  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 423 (lact. bulgaricus) and lact.acidophilus crl 730 was compared using a mouse model of salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of iga in the gut. additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic  protein (mcp-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. although lact. acidophilus increased the number of iga-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and lact. bulgaricus increased mcp-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone  were not enough to confer protection against salmonella typhimurium infection in  mouse. conclusions: probiotic strain lact. casei crl 431 was the one that induced protection against salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and  by decreasing the local inflammatory response. significance and impact of the study: salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei crl 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune  system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of salmonella infections. we demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.

TI  == construction and immunological evaluation of dual cell surface display of hiv-1 gag and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flic in lactobacillus acidophilus for vaccine delivery.
AB  == oral vaccines that elicit a mucosal immune response may be effective against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) because its transmission occurs mainly at the mucosa. the aim of this study was to construct recombinant lactobacillus for oral delivery of oral vaccines against hiv-1 and to evaluate their immunogenicity. a recombinant lactobacillus acidophilus strain expressing the hiv-1 gag on the bacterial cell surface was established by fusion with the signal peptide and anchor motif of a mucus binding protein (mub) from l. acidophilus with or without coexpression of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flagellin (flic) fused to a different mub signal peptide and anchor.  using hek293 cells engineered to express toll-like receptor 5 (tlr5), the biological activity of flic on the bacterial cell surfaces was determined. the surface-exposed flagellin retained its tlr5-stimulating activity, suggesting that the recombinant strain with gag and flic dual display might provide a different immunopotency than the strain expressing only gag. the immunological properties of the recombinant strains were assessed by coculture with human myeloid dendritic cells (dcs). the heterologous antigens on the cell surface affected maturation and cytokine responses of dcs. acquired immune responses were also investigated by intragastric immunization of mice. the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay showed induction of gamma interferon-producing cells at  local mucosa after immunization of mice with the gag-producing strain. meanwhile, the immunization with l. acidophilus displaying both gag and flic resulted in an  increase of gag-specific iga-secreting cells. these results suggested that the gag-displaying l. acidophilus elicited specific immune responses and the coexistence of flic conferred an adjuvant effect on local iga production.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

TI  == strain dependent protection conferred by lactobacillus spp. administered orally with a salmonella typhimurium vaccine in a murine challenge model.
AB  == consumption of lactobacillus spp. has been shown to enhance immune responses in mice. this study examined the immuno-adjuvant capacity of two strains: lactobacillus acidophilus l10 and lactobacillus fermentum pc2, in the induction of protective humoral immunity in a salmonella typhimurium vaccine challenge model. briefly, balb/c mice were divided into four groups. three groups of mice received s. typhimurium vaccine (10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per dose) on days 0 and 14. in addition to the vaccine, five doses (10(8) cfu per dose) of either l. acidophilus l10 or l. fermentum pc2 were also administered to a group.  all mice were challenged with viable s. typhimurium on day 28. on day 10 post challenge, the study was terminated and microbial and immunological parameters were assessed. mice dosed with l. fermentum pc2 in addition to the vaccine had a  significantly enhanced s. typhimurium humoral response. the mice in this group had high levels of lactobacilli in the feces and in association with the peyer's  patches, no detectable levels of either lactobacilli or s. typhimurium in the spleen, and no detectable weight loss. mice given l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine were unable to exhibit elevated s. typhimurium specific humoral responses. however, there was no detectable s. typhimurium in the spleens of this group. interestingly, translocation of lactobacilli into the spleen was observed  as well as a slight weight loss was noted in mice that received the l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine. this study shows that, the l. fermentum pc2 had a greater capacity than the l. acidophilus l10 to act as an oral adjuvant in a s. typhimurium oral vaccine program and afforded greater protection against a live s. typhimurium challenge.

AB  == d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on  all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of  fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == impairment of swimming motility by antidiarrheic lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb retards internalization of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium within human enterocyte-like cells.
AB  == we report that both culture and the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb (lacteol boucard) have the ability (i) to delay the appearance of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344-induced mobilization of f-actin and, subsequently, (ii) to retard cell entry by s. typhimurium sl1344. time-lapse imaging and western immunoblotting showed that s. typhimurium sl1344 swimming motility, as represented by cell tracks of various types, was rapidly but temporarily blocked without affecting the expression of flic flagellar propeller protein. we show that the product(s) secreted by l. acidophilus lb that supports the inhibitory activity is heat stable and of low molecular weight. the product(s) caused rapid depolarization of the s. typhimurium sl1344 cytoplasmic membrane without affecting bacterial viability. we identified inhibition of swimming motility as a newly discovered mechanism by which the secreted product(s) of l. acidophilus strain lb retards the internalization of the diarrhea-associated pathogen s. enterica serovar typhimurium within cultured human enterocyte-like cells.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus s-layer protein-mediated inhibition of salmonella-induced apoptosis in caco-2 cells.
AB  == surface layer (s-layer) proteins are crystalline arrays of proteinaceous subunits present as the outermost component of the cell wall in several lactobacillus species. the underlying mechanism for how s-layer proteins inhibit pathogen infections remains unclear. to gain insights into the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus s-layer proteins, we examined how lactobacillus s-layer proteins impact salmonella typhimurium-induced apoptosis in vitro in caco-2 human colon epithelial cells. when caco-2 cells infected with salmonella typhimurium sl1344, we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-1. when salmonella typhimurium sl1344 and s-layer proteins were coincubated simultaneously, caco-2 cell apoptosis was markedly decreased and the cell damage was modified, as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy. detailed analyses showed that the s-layer proteins inhibited the caspase-3 activity and activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (erk1/2) signaling pathway. taken together, these findings suggest that lactobacillus s-layer proteins protected against salmonella-induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-3 activation. in addition, salmonella-induced apoptotic cell damage was modified by s-layer proteins through the erk1/2 signaling pathway. this mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing salmonella infection.

TI  == [effects of s-layer proteins from lactobacillus against salmonella typhimurium adhesion and invasion on caco-2 cells].
AB  == objective: s-layer proteins of lactobacillus acidophilus were extracted and purified, then the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and its s-layer proteins against the adhesion and invasion of salmonella typhimurium to caco-2 cells were  investigated. methods: s-layer proteins were purified by anion-exchange column {diethylaminoethyl (deae) de52}, and the inhibition of lactobacillus acidophilus  and its s-layer proteins were studied against the adhesion and invasion of salmonella typhimurium on caco-2 cells. results: s-layer proteins exhibited strongly inhibitory effects of adhesive and invading properties of salmonella typhimurium. in the adhesive experiments (competitive, exclusive and displacement), salmonella typhimurium adhesion was reduced by s-layer proteins and the ability of adherence to caco-2 cells were 1.17% +/- 5.97%, 8.71% +/- 1.36% and 10.56% +/- 0.92%, respectively (p < 0.01). the influence to inhibit the competitive adhesion of salmonella typhimurium was optimal. furthermore, the s-layer proteins showed a stronger effect than lactobacillus acidophilus to inhibit salmonella typhimurium adhesion on caco-2 monolayers (p < 0.01). moreover, invasion of salmonella typhimurium to caco-2 monolayers was inhibited by s-layer proteins. conclusion: s-layer proteins inhibited adherence and invasion of salmonella typhimurium. the result can merit a highlight for preventive or probiotic therapy in human or animals with disease caused by salmonella typhimurium.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == synergistic effects of the lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  == we have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (s-layer) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356. here we show that, in combination with nisin, this s-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic gram-negative salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. in addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the gram-positive species tested. we postulate that the s-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the s-layer murein hydrolase activity.

TI  == protective efficacy of probiotic alone or in conjunction with a prebiotic in salmonella-induced liver damage.
AB  == in view of the increasing interest in the bioecological and nutritional control of diseases, use of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (synbiotics) appears as a therapeutic option for various diseases. in this study, an attempt was made to explore the protective potential of lactobacillus acidophilus as a probiotic, inulin as a prebiotic and both l. acidophilus and inulin as synbiotic against salmonella-induced liver damage in a murine model. the probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation resulted in decreased bacterial translocation in the liver of mice challenged with salmonella typhimurium and decreased levels of serum aminotransferases, suggesting their protective role against salmonella infection. mice supplemented with these preparations before salmonella challenge also revealed decreased levels of lipid  peroxidation, increased levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, along with reduced levels of nitric oxide. thus, bacteriological and biochemical alterations correlated well with the histological evidence. protection afforded by supplementation with the probiotic alone was found to be more effective. none  of the observations was suggestive of the synergistic effect in the synbiotic-supplemented animals. thus, it is indicated that the probiotic and the  prebiotic used in the present study may act by different mechanisms involved in affording protection against salmonella-induced liver damage.

AB  == a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory  isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells. three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic  bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. the inhibition pattern was similar for live and  heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01). the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.

TI  == dahi containing probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei has a protective effect against salmonella enteritidis infection in mice.
AB  == salmonella enteritidis infection has received attention during recent years owing to its high prevalence worldwide. in the present study, the protective effect of  probiotic dahi (curd) supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei against salmonella enteritidis infection in mice is investigated. seven days pre-feeding with probiotic dahi significantly increased anti-s. enteritidis siga  (secretary iga) antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation in s. enteritidis infected mice. il-2, il-6 and ifn-gamma production were significantly increased in supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi, while il-4 levels were not changed significantly. moreover, activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase, and counts of s. enteritidis in intestine, liver and spleen were decreased, whereas total lactobacilli in faeces  were increased in mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi. pre-feeding of probiotic dahi for 7 days was more effective than 2 days pre-feeding. thus, the results indicate that, pre-feeding with probiotic dahi ameliorated s. enteritidis infection by stimulating specific and non-specific immune response. above all, it lowered colonization of gastrointestinal tract as well as translocation of s. enteritidis.

TI  == interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual  microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional  foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.

TI  == surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial dna.
AB  == colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial dna in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. bacterial dna is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9). the aim of this study was to investigate tlr9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial dna. ht-29 cells were exposed to dna from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. tlr9 mrna expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. localization of tlr9 was determined by flow cytometry in ht-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in ht-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of tlr9 in ht-29 cells under basal conditions. exposure of cells to dna from pathogenic strains of salmonella and escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in tlr9 mrna expression. salmonella enterica serovar dublin dna increased surface tlr9 protein and il-8 secretion. there was no change in mrna levels or localization of tlr9 in response to bifidobacterium breve. chloroquine did not block il-8 secretion in response to s. enterica serovar dublin dna. tlr9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface  in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial dna and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of tlr9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic dna is mediated at least in part by increased tlr9 expression.

AB  == lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus  atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell  surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7  to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic  properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive  exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.

TI  == immune effect of heat-killed multistrain of lactobacillus acidophilus against salmonella typhimurium invasion to mice.
AB  == aims: this study attempted to determine whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) could  have a better probiotic function when used as a multistrain mixture, i.e. mix-lab, than when used as a monostrain. to this end, three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, specifically strain lap5, laf1 and lah7, were heat-killed and mixed. this heat-killed mix-lab was used to evaluate the effectiveness of multistrain in inhibiting salmonella invasion into cultured cells and into organs (spleen and liver) of live mice. methods and results: balb/c mice were orally administered with heat-killed mix-lab or sterile normal saline (control) for seven consecutive days and then challenged with orally administered salmonella typhimurium on day 8. results showed that, at day 6 after the challenge, the mice which had received mix-lab exhibited lower rates (p < 0.05) of salmonella invasion into liver and spleen than did the control mice. also, before the salmonella challenge, the serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between these two  groups of mice. after the challenge, however, the serum tnf-alpha level was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in the control group, but not significantly changed in the mix-lab fed mice. to investigate possible factors involved in heat-killed mix-labs antagonistic effect on salmonella invasion of mouse organs,  heat-killed single strain and mix-lab were evaluated for ability to inhibit salmonella invasion into cultured human intestinal int-407 and caco-2 cells. results showed that none of the heat-killed strains were able to protect these cultured cells from salmonella invasion, even though strains of lap5 and mix-lab  were adherent to them. however, study of the activation of murine macrophage raw  264.7 cells showed that heat-killed mix-lab stimulated tnf-alpha production, nitric oxide release, and increased phagocytic activity in macrophages. conclusions: our findings suggest that heat-killed mix-lab can inhibit salmonella invasion of mouse organs through the immunomodulating role of activated macrophage. significance and impact of the study: the ability of heat-killed mix-lab to prevent bacterial infection in mice was found to be more significant than that of viable monostrain. this effect may be due to the activation of the immune system rather than to the adherence of lab to the intestine epithelium.

TI  == mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == effects of lactobacilli and lactose on salmonella typhimurium colonisation and microbial fermentation in the crop of the young turkey.
AB  == 1. three experiments were performed to examine the effects of lactobacilli and lactose on microbial fermentation and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium colonisation in the crop of the young turkey. 2. the following carboxylic acids were detected in the crop ingesta: formic, acetic, butyric, lactic, valeric, caproic, oxalic, phenyl acetic, succinic and fumaric; propionic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids were not detectable. 3. at the beginning of the night, there were considerable quantities of ingesta in the crop of young turkeys. during the  scotophase, there were progressive reductions in the contents and ph. moreover, there were linear increases in the concentration of lactic, valeric and caproic acids (by approximately 7-fold over 8 h). much smaller changes in crop ph were observed in the study where dietary treatments of lactobacilli were not included. 4. chronic addition of lactose or lactobacilli to the diet exerted modest effects on the carboxylic acid concentration in the crop contents but did not consistently influence colonisation of the crop by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. 5. young turkeys confine eating to the hours of illumination (photophase) with a peak in consumption prior to the subjective dusk.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == a lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human gastrointestinal microbiota origin elicits killing of enterovirulent salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium by triggering lethal bacterial membrane damage.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal microbiota produces antagonistic activities against gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens. we undertook a study to investigate the mechanism(s) by which a lactobacillus acidophilus strain of human microbiota origin antagonizes the gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen salmonella enterica  serovar typhimurium. we showed that the cell-free culture supernatant of l. acidophilus strain lb (lb-cfcs) induced the following effects in s. enterica sl1344: (i) a decrease in intracellular atp that paralleled bacterial death, (ii) the release of lipopolysaccharide, (iii) permeabilization of the bacterial membrane, and (iv) an increase in the sensitivity of salmonella to the lytic action of sodium dodecyl sulfate. finally, we showed using two mutant strains of  salmonella, phop ms7953s and pmra jks1170, that the two-component regulatory systems phop-phoq and pmra-pmrb that regulate the mechanisms of resistance to antibacterial agents in salmonella did not influence the anti-salmonella effect of lb-cfcs.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  == twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (alcaligenes faecalis, aspergillus niger, bacillus stearothermophilus, geotrichum candidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, penicillium expansum, pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. they were also tested for specific activity against s. aureus 9144 and b. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. honey inhibited bacterial  growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. the ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. antibacterially active samples in this study included montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. furthermore, the bacteria were not  uniformly affected by honey. varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of s. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. b. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay  and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included a. faecalis and l. acidophilus. non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against b. stearothermophilus. further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium colonization of the crop in the domestic  turkey: influence of probiotic and prebiotic treatment (lactobacillus acidophilus and lactose).
AB  == acute colonization of the crop of the domestic turkey by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (st) was examined. the influences of preharvest probiotic and prebiotic treatment with lactobaccilli and lactose on crop colonization with st were also investigated. prior to salmonella challenge, poults received 2.5% lactose and lactobacillus acidophilus (1.9 x 10(9) organisms/liter) in the only source of drinking water from 1 day old to termination. at 3-wk-old, turkey poults were challenged with st (1.7 x 10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before their natural nocturnal fast to determine the potential effects of supplementation on crop colonization when the crop was engorged and subsequently  undergoing emptying. crop ingesta and tissue were collected at time points 30 min and 4, 8, and 24 hr postchallenge and st levels were determined. high levels of st were detected in the crop. for instance, for the poults not receiving lactose  or lactobacilli, 30 min after st challenge, there were 4.4 x 10(7) cfu in the crop ingesta and 5.3 x 10(5) cfu in the crop wall. ingesta st levels dropped dramatically to 1.0 x 10(6) cfu after 4 hr as the crop emptied. crop wall st levels were steady during the nocturnal crop evacuation. immunohistochemical staining demonstrated st in close association with the crop epithelium. treatment with lactose and l. acidophilus supplementation did not reduce st colonization.

AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants  of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the  pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.

AB  == salmonella enteritidis colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes foodborne illness in humans. reduction of salmonella enteritidis colonization in  the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic combined with salmonella enteritidis-, salmonella typhimurium-, and salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies on the cecal colonization and organ invasion of salmonella enteritidis in broiler as well as on body weights. the treatment group was defined as chicks spray-vaccinated with  avian pac plus at the hatchery and given avian pac plus for the first 3 days after placement. an intermediate treatment was given at 10 and 14 days, 2 days prior to vaccination and 2 days postvaccination. all birds were vaccinated with newcastle disease vaccine, la sota virus (one drop/eye) at 12 days of age. a final treatment was given 3 days preslaughter. the control group was defined as chicks not given avian pac plus at any time. six hours after oral administration  of the probiotic suspension (treatment group) or water (control group) at placement, the chicks were challenged with salmonella enteritidis. all chickens were orally inoculated with 0.25 ml of salmonella enteritidis that contained 4 x  10(7) cfu/1.0 ml. cecal colonization and organ invasion were evaluated for salmonella enteritidis on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41. the probiotic-treated group had a significantly lower concentration of salmonella enteritidis cecal colonization at days 3, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 41 when compared to the nontreated, control group (p < 0.05). similarly, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the isolation of salmonella enteritidis from the internal organs (liver and spleen) when probiotic-treated and nonprobiotic-treated groups were compared. there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the mean body weight between the two experimental groups at each collection period. these results indicated that a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, and salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, and salmonella heidelberg-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of salmonella enteritidis in market-aged broilers.

AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and escherichia coli are probiotic strains used individually to protect against enteropathogenic agents. in order to determine if a synergistic effect of the individual protective mechanisms ordinarily attributed to each of these biotherapeutic agents is possible, we orally administered lact. acidophilus h2b20, s. boulardii and e. coli emo (lse) to germfree mice. ten days after colonization of the digestive tract, groups of animals associated (experimental) or not (control) with lse were challenged orally with streptomycin resistant (sfr) or streptomycin sensitive (sfs) shigella flexneri strains or salmonella enteritidis subsp. typhimurium. bacterial counts in faeces from experimental mice showed that the sfr strain was  eliminated 11 d after challenge while sfs and s. enteritidis subsp. typhimurium colonized the digestive tract and continued to be present at high population levels (108 cfu g-1 of faeces), which is similar to that observed in control animals. all possible di- and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed before experimental oral infection with sfr. the data showed that antagonism was obtained only when e. coli emo was present. different sensitivity of sh. flexneri sfr and sfs to e. coli emo antagonism could be explained by the different generation times between sfr and sfs, as shown by colonization kinetic experiments in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == dietary calcium phosphate stimulates intestinal lactobacilli and decreases the severity of a salmonella infection in rats.
AB  == we have shown recently that dietary calcium phosphate (capi) has a trophic effect on the intestinal microflora and strongly protects against salmonella infection.  it was speculated that precipitation by capi of intestinal surfactants, such as bile acids and fatty acids, reduced the cytotoxicity of intestinal contents and favored growth of the microflora. because lactobacilli may have antagonistic activity against pathogens, the main purpose of the present study was to examine  whether this capi-induced protection coincides with a reinforcement of the endogenous lactobacilli. in vitro, salmonella enteritidis appeared to be insensitive to bile acids and fatty acids, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus was  killed by physiologically relevant concentrations of these surfactants. additionally, after adaptation to a purified diet differing only in capi concentration (20 and 180 mmol cahpo4. 2h2o/kg), rats (n = 8) were orally infected with s. enteritidis. besides reducing the cytotoxicity and the concentration of bile acids and fatty acids of ileal contents and fecal water, capi notably changed the composition of ileal bile acids in a less cell-damaging  direction. significantly greater numbers of ileal and fecal lactobacilli were detected in noninfected, capi-supplemented rats. as judged by the lower urinary nox excretion, which is a biomarker of intestinal bacterial translocation, dietary capi reduced the invasion of salmonella. additionally, the colonization resistance was improved considering the reduction of excreted fecal salmonella. in accordance, fewer viable salmonella were detected in ileal contents and on the ileal mucosa in the capi group. in conclusion, reducing the intestinal surfactant concentration by dietary capi strengthens the endogenous lactobacilli and increases the resistance to salmonella.

AB  == salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. reduction of s. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and s. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of s. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. avian pac plus, which contains lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, ad s. typhimurium-specific antibodies. at placement, these chicks were administered avian pac plus in the water. six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) cfu of s. typhimurium. chicks were administered avian pac plus for two additional days postchallenge. chicks were evaluated for s. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks  and every 7 days for 6 weeks. the mean cecal and colonic concentration of s. typhimurium from the avian pac plus-treated group was significantly lower at day  31 (p = 0.0001), day 38 (p = 0.0005), and day 43 (p = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. these results indicated that a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, and s typhimurium-specific antibodies have a  beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of s. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.

TI  == antimutagenic properties of probiotic bacteria and of organic acids.
AB  == antimutagenic activities of live and killed cells of 6 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and 9 strains of bifidobacteria and of organic acids usually produced by these probiotic bacteria were determined using 8 potent chemical mutagens and  promutagens. the mutagens and promutagens used were n-methyl, n'-nitro, n-nitrosoguanidine; 2-nitroflourene; 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine; 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide; aflatoxin-b; 2-amino-3-methyl-3h-imidazoquinoline; 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo (4,5-b) pyridine, and 2-amino-3-methyl-9h-pyrido (3,3-6) indole. the mutagenicity of these mutagens and antimutagenic activity of probiotic bacteria against the mutagens were determined according to the ames ta-100 assay using a mutant of salmonella typhimurium. efficiency of bacterial cells in binding or inhibiting these mutagens was also investigated. live cells of probiotic bacteria showed higher antimutagenic activity and their efficiency in inhibiting the mutagens was better than killed bacterial cells. live bacterial cells bound or inhibited the mutagens permanently, whereas killed bacteria released mutagens upon extraction with dimethyl sulfoxide. among the organic acids, butyric acid showed highest inhibition of mutagens followed by acetic acid. lactic and pyruvic acids did not  show appreciable levels of inhibition.

TI  == the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected  by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.

TI  == influence of carcinogen binding by lactic acid-producing bacteria on tissue distribution and in vivo mutagenicity of dietary carcinogens.
AB  == the aims of this investigation were to determine whether viable cultures of lactic acid-producing organisms (lab) can bind dietary carcinogens and to assess  the consequences of binding for the absorption from the gut, distribution in the  body and in vivo genotoxicity of ingested carcinogens. the carcinogens used in this study were ones known to be present in the human diet, namely benzo[a]pyrene (b(a)p, aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and the cooked food carcinogens 2-amino-3-methyl-3h-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (iq), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (meiq), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (meiqx), 5-phenyl-2-amino-1-methylimidazo [4,5-f]pyridine (phip) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (trp-p-2). they represent a range of structural types so that the specificity of any binding effects could be addressed. of the carcinogens tested, b(a)p and trp-p-2 were bound most effectively by the two lab strains bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus. afb1 was poorly bound, while meiqx, meiq, phip and iq were bound to  an intermediate degree. the extent of the binding of the heterocyclic amine carcinogens was dependent on the ph conditions during incubation and this effect  was more apparent with b. longum than with l. acidophilus. using the host-mediated assay (hma), an in vivo bacterial mutation assay, it was demonstrated that the administration of bacterial cell suspensions of b. longum and l. acidophilus did not lead to a reduction in induced mutagenicity by meiq, meiqx or trp-p-2, detectable in the liver of treated mice compared with controls. the lack of a protective effect could not be attributed to a short period of contact between bacterial cells and mutagens, since similar results were obtained after preincubating bacteria and mutagens together at ph 5 for 50-60 min, to maximize the binding, before gavaging the mice. lack of activity of b(a)p in the  hma prevented the determination of the effect of lab on genotoxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. however, it is clear from the radiolabel distribution study that the amount of the carcinogen entering the blood was not significantly reduced by b. longum administration. in addition, the amount of radiolabelled b(a)p that reached the target organs (liver, lungs and heart) was also not affected by the lab administration. a similar lack of inhibitory effect  of b. longum on blood concentration and accumulation in the liver of trp-p-2 was  apparent. the results of the present study suggest that although lab may bind carcinogens in vitro, this does not lead to major changes in absorption and distribution of carcinogens in the body, or in their genotoxic activity in the liver.

TI  == antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
AB  == the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed  as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.

AB  == several bacterial strains were examined for their ability to degrade the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt). the strains examined included various clostridial strains isolated from a 4-year-old munition enrichment, related clostridial strains obtained from a culture collection, two enteric bacteria, and three lactobacilli. all clostridium species tested were able to reduce tnt rapidly in a complex medium. in cell suspension experiments, these strains were also able to reduce 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (dant) to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (tat) and to produce a compound that is not yet identified; thus, they could not be distinguished from one another with regard to the pathway of transformation. the enteric strains and the lactobacilli were able to perform  the initial reduction of tnt, but none was capable of reducing dant in cell suspensions.

AB  == the effect of dietary lactose and lactobacillus acidophilus on the colonization of salmonella enteritidis (phage type 4) in newly hatched leghorn chicks concurrently infected with eimeria tenella was studied. there were six groups of  birds in each of two replicate trials: uninfected controls, birds infected with s. enteritidis, birds infected with s. enteritidis and e. tenella, birds infected with s. enteritidis and e. tenella that were fed with dietary lactose (5%), birds infected with s. enteritidis and e. tenella that were provided with l. acidophilus, and birds infected with s. enteritidis and e. tenella that were fed  both l. acidophilus and dietary lactose (5%). chickens were necropsied at 2, 5, and 8 days after s. enteritidis inoculation for bacteriological examination. the  cecal population of s. enteritidis was significantly increased by infection with  e. tenella. lactose alone and the combination of lactose and l. acidophilus significantly reduced the population of s. enteritidis in the ceca of birds infected with e. tenella (p < 0.05), but the combination was more effective than  lactose alone (p < 0.05). adding anaerobic culture of l. acidophilus alone did not significantly decrease the population of s. enteritidis in the ceca. no significant reduction of colonization of s. enteritidis in the liver and spleen of birds with coccidiosis was observed.

TI  == modulation of a specific humoral immune response and changes in intestinal flora  mediated through fermented milk intake.
AB  == this study was undertaken to elucidate whether eating a fermented milk containing lactobacillus acidophilus la1 and bifidobacteria could induce changes in intestinal flora and modulate the immune response in man. volunteers consumed a fermented milk containing l. acidophilus la1 and bifidobacteria over a period of  three weeks during which an attenuated salmonella typhi ty21a was administered to mimic an enteropathogenic infection. a control group ate no fermented foods but received the s. typhi ty21a. faecal flora analyses showed an increase in l. acidophilus and bifidobacterial counts during fermented milk intake. the specific serum iga titre rise to s. typhi ty21a in the test group was > 4-fold and significantly higher (p = 0.04) than in the control group. an increase in total serum iga was also observed. these results indicate that lactic acid bacteria which can persist in the gastrointestinal tract can act as adjuvants to the humoral immune response.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of enteroinvasive pathogens to human intestinal caco-2 cells by lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb decreases bacterial invasion.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were found to adhere to the brush border of differentiated human intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells in culture, whereas yersinia pseudotuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes  adhered to the periphery of undifferentiated caco-2 cells. all these enterovirulent strains invaded the caco-2 cells. using a heat-killed human lactobacillus acidophilus (strain lb) which strongly adheres both to undifferentiated and differentiated caco-2 cells, we have studied inhibition of cell association with and invasion within caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria. living and heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb inhibited both cell association and invasion of caco-2 cells by enterovirulent bacteria in  a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanism of inhibition of both adhesion and invasion appears to be due to steric hindrance of human enterocytic pathogen  receptors by whole-cell lactobacilli rather than to a specific blockade of receptors.

TI  == antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the s. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  == a high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. one way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of dna damage and other types of anticarcinogens. specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. we have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. four  types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. the effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. eight of 10 isolated lactobacillus strains reduced the yield  of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. the degree of  suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. in contrast,  yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. the other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. the results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.

AB  == broilers (6 wk of age) were crop-intubated with a nalidixic acid-resistant strain of salmonella typhimurium and given four withdrawal feeds: 1) control feed (corn  and soybean meal base, 18% cp and 3,200 kcal me/kg); 2) control plus 5% whey (61% lactose); 3) control plus probiotic (6.8 x 10(6) cfu of bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium thermophilium, and lactobacillus acidophilus); and  4) control plus 5% whey plus probiotic. in experiment 1, male broilers received 9.8 x 10(7) cfu of s. typhimurium per bird midway through a 20-h fast. the withdrawal feeds were continuously offered through a subsequent period of 6 to 7  days. live performance of broilers during this time was similar among treatments. ceca from birds consuming whey were significantly (p less than .05) increased in  weight and distended with gas. recovery of s. typhimurium from the ceca was low with all treatments, and the effects of whey or probiotic at reducing the organism could not be determined. in experiment 2, female broilers received the same four experimental feeds for 48 h. salmonella typhimurium was intubated 24 h  after feed access (1.2 x 10(7) cfu per bird). again, no differences (p greater than .05) in performance occurred, but the inclusion of whey led to increased cecal weight and size (p less than .05). large numbers of s. typhimurium were recovered from the ceca 24 h after intubation, but the levels were similar among  treatments. whey and probiotic in the withdrawal feed did not appear to affect the salmonella level in ceca when the organism was consumed prior to marketing.

TI  == prevention of gastrointestinal infection using immunobiological methods with milk fermented with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of lactobacillus casei sp. and lb. acidophilus sp. against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice was compared with that obtained feeding milks fermented with these microorganisms individually. the survival rate obtained after oral infection with sal. typhimurium was 100% in mice pretreated by feeding during 8 d with the mixture of lb. casei and lb. acidophilus fermented milks. similar treatments with the individual milks were ineffective. moreover, mice became more susceptible to  infection with sal. typhimurium after such treatment. the colonization of liver and spleen with the pathogen was markedly inhibited by the pretreatment with the  mixture of fermented milk, while such inhibition was not observed using the lb. casei and lb. acidophilus milks. the highest levels of anti-salmonellae antibodies in serum and in intestinal fluid were found in the group of mice fed with the mixture and with lb. casei fermented milk respectively. however, this latter milk was not effective in protecting against sal. typhimurium. when the mice were first infected with sal. typhimurium and then fed with the mixture of fermented milks, pathogen colonization was not prevented. the results suggest that the augmentation of resistance to salmonellae caused by the treatment with lb. casei- + lb. acidophilus-fermented milk was due to the anti-salmonellae protective immunity mainly mediated by the mucosal tissue. milk fermented with this mixture could be used as an immunobiological method to prevent gastrointestinal infection.
