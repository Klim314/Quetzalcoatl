TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of an oral DNA vaccine encoding Sip of Streptococcus agalactiae from Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus delivered by live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL7207 was used as a carrier for a reconstructed DNA vaccine against Streptococcus agalactiae. A 1.02 kb DNA fragment, encoding for a portion of the surface immunogenic protein (Sip) of S. agalactiae was inserted into pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX1-sip was transfected in EPC cells to detect the transient expression by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, together with Western blot analysis. The pVAX1-sip was transformed by electroporation into SL7207. The stability of pVAX1-sip into Salmonella was over 90% after 50 generations with antibiotic selection in vitro while remained stable over 80% during 35 generations under antibiotic-free conditions. The LD50 of SL/pVAX1-sip was 1.7 x 10(11) CFU/fish by intragastric administration which indicated a quite low virulence. Tilapias were inoculated orally at 10(8) CFU/fish, the recombinant bacteria were found present in intestinal tract, spleens and livers and eventually eliminated from the tissues 4 weeks after immunization. Fish immunized at 10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/fish with different immunization times caused various levels of serum antibody and an effective protection against lethal challenge with the wild-type strain S. agalactiae. Integration studies showed that the pVAX1-sip did not integrate with tilapia chromosomes. The DNA vaccine SL/pVAX1-sip was proved to be safe and effective in protecting tilapias against S. agalactiae infection.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to World Health Organization first-line antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. Here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the World Health Organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in Malawi. METHODS: We reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008, at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. RESULTS: We identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. Sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common pathogens were Group B Streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). One hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months of age. In this group, the most common isolates were S. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), Group B Streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). More isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.006). In particular, Gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.020). Penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for Gram-negative than Gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In view of these results, the World Health Organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Septicemic salmonellosis in a two-humped camel calf (Camelus bactrianus).
AB  - A 1-week old, two-humped female camel (Camelus bactrianus) calf with continual whining, epiphora, anorexia, muscle twitching, and lateral recumbency was referred to a veterinary hospital. Although she died shortly after preliminary clinical examination, but necropsy was performed and tissue samples were taken for further microbiological and pathological examinations. On bacteriological investigation, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus agalactiae were isolated. Histopathologically, lesions consisted of hyperemia and hemorrhage in all serosal and mucosal surfaces, gastroenteritis, and purulent ascites, associated with suppurative omphalitis. Acute nutmeg liver demonstrated centrilobular congestion and moderate fatty changes without any inflammatory cell infiltration. The abomasal and intestinal mucosa were hemorrhagic and erosive. The brain was hyperemic with severe fibrinopurulent meningoencephalitis. Except for dromedary camels and llamas, there has been no previous report of an acute, fatal septicemia in a two-humped camel calf due to S. typhimurium accompanied by S. agalactiae.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - [Purulent pericarditis with pericardial tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no typhi].
AB  - Purulent pericarditis (PP) is an uncommon condition with high mortality. In the preantibiotic period, Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. We describe the case of a 75-year old man with septic shock, PP and cardiac tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no-typhi. To our knowledge this association of pathogenic organisms has not been previously reported in the literature. The pathogenesis is here reviewed, and in our patient presumably, purulent pericarditis occurred via hematogeneus spread undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient's course was complicated and he died on 34th hospital day. After this case report it is considered that differential etiologic diagnosis of PP should include these agents, especially in immunodepressed patients with predisposing factors.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - Risks for bacteremia and urinary tract infections in young febrile children with  bronchiolitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the risks for bacteremia and urinary tract injections (UTI) in young febrile children with and without bronchiolitis. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: The emergency departments of 3 pediatric referral hospitals. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 432 previously healthy febrile patients aged 24 months or younger. Patients were divided into groups, based on the presence (n = 163, bronchiolitis group) or absence (n = 269, control group) of wheezing and/or retractions on examination. Blood cultures were obtained from all patients, and urine cultures were obtained from female patients, and male patients aged 6 months or younger. Chest radiographs were obtained on patients with lower respiratory tract signs, and those with lobar pneumonias were excluded (7 wheezing and 8 nonwheezing patients), leaving 156 patients with bronchiolitis and 261 control patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth of any bacterial pathogens from the blood or 10(4) colony-forming units per milliliter or more from the urine. RESULTS: None of the 156 patients with bronchiolitis had bacteremia (95% confidence interval, 0%-1.9%) vs 2.7% of the 261 controls (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-5.4%; P = .049); 1.9% of the patients with bronchiolitis had UTI vs 13.6% of the controls (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.55; P = .001). None of the subset of patients with bronchiolitis aged 2 months or younger (n = 36) had bacteremia or UTI; however, there were not enough of these younger patients to make statistically conclusive comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Previously healthy febrile children aged 24 months or younger with bronchiolitis are unlikely to have bacteremia or UTI. Therefore, routine cultures of the blood and urine in these patients are unnecessary. More data are needed regarding the subset of febrile infants aged 2 months or younger with bronchiolitis.
TI  - Mothers of infants with neonatal group B streptococcal septicemia are poor responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens.
AB  - Serum antibodies against various carbohydrate antigens were studied in 16 mothers of infants with serious infections caused by group B streptococci (GBS) (the study group), and compared with a control group of 29 urogenital carriers of GBS who gave birth to neonatally healthy infants. Using a radioimmunoassay for the determination of antibodies to GBS types Ia, Ib, II and III, it was found that the study group had significantly lower levels of IgG antibodies to each of the 4 GBS types than the control group. The IgG levels against Salmonella BO and DO, Yersinia enterocolitica 03, Francisella tularense and Streptococcus pneumonia types 3, 6, 9, 19 and 23 purified carbohydrate antigens were determined using an ELISA technique. Significantly more individuals in the study group than in the control group had low levels of IgG antibodies against 8 of 9 carbohydrate antigens. No difference was found in IgM levels against 3 of 4 antigens studied, while the study group showed significantly more IgM antibodies against Salmonella DO than the controls. These results indicate that mothers of GBS-infected infants might be poor IgG antibody responders to bacterial carbohydrate antigens in general.
