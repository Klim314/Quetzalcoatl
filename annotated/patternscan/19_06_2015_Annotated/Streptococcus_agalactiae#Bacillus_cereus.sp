TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == mercuric reductase activity of multiple heavy metal-resistant lysinibacillus sphaericus g1.
AB  == a culture was isolated from an industrial mercuric salt-contaminated soil, which  could tolerate cd, co, zn, cr, and hg up to 190, 525, 350, 935, and 370 mum, respectively. the isolate was identified as lysinibacillus sphaericus by 16s rrna gene sequencing. it bioaccumulated cd, co, and zn, and reductively detoxified cr  and hg. chromate reductase and mercuric reductase (mera) activities in the cell extract were 2.4 and 0.13 units mg(-1) protein, respectively. the study also describes designing of broad-specificity primers based on firmicute mera genes. these primers were successfully used to amplify a 440 bp mera fragment from the current isolate. based on the partial sequence, complete mera orf of 1641 bp was  amplified. it showed 99% similarity to a putative mera gene from distantly related streptococcus agalactiae, but only 72% identity with the well-characterized mera from a more closely related bacillus cereus rc607. the gene sequence possessed all the features required for the functioning of mera enzyme, and its function was confirmed by recombinant expression in e. coli. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of full length mera gene from l. sphaericus.

TI  == the effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on staphylococcus aureus dmst 4745.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (lg) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on  s. aureus biofilm formation. attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological  changes of s. aureus dmst 4745 were also made. the results demonstrate that s. agalactiae and b. cereus are more susceptible to lg, citral and geraniol than s.  aureus and e. coli. moreover, they also inhibit s. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. the lg appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.

TI  == autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a qm/mm simulation.
AB  == many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between asn and lys side chains within the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128 and subsequently in gbs52 from streptococcus agalactiae, in the bcpa major pilin of bacillus cereus and in the rrgb pilin of streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. within each pilin subunit,  intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. these bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. for the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including asn, lys, and a catalytically important acidic glu (or asp) residue are responsible. however, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to  isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as spy0128 and rrgb. this suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. from this mechanistic perspective, we used the qm/mm minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. it  was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia.  more importantly, within the dual active sites of spy0128, glu(117), and glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. this work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extract, fractions and four compounds extracted from piper solmsianum c. dc. var. solmsianum (piperaceae).
AB  == piper solmsianum c. dc. var. solmsianum (piperaceae) is a shrub commonly found in areas with wet tropical soils. other piper species have been used in folk medicine as antitumoral and antiseptic agents. we studied the crude methanolic extract, some organic fractions and compounds isolated from this plant for possible antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the bioautographic assays disclosed three inhibition zones. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined showing excellent activity, particularly against the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and streptococcus agalactiae). it appears that the antimicrobial activity of piper solmsianum is related mainly to the presence of conocarpan and eupomatenoid-5 (neolignans). however another, as yet unidentified, active compound could also be extracted from the plant.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the dar es salaam region, tanzania.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (msps) in dar es salaam region. total bacterial count (tbc) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the california mastitis test (cmt) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. moreover, a water sample at each msp was taken for bacteriological culturing. finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the msps to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. a total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in dar es salaam region. the mean tbc was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were escherichia coli (6.3%), bacillus cereus (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). in most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the cmt and  7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. tbc was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of tbc were identified by fitting two linear regression models. in a random effect model, water microbial quality,  frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log tbc. in a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log tbc. it was concluded that the milk sold in dar es salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == isolation of s-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from allium siculum.
AB  == isolation and identification of (s(s)r(c))-s-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of allium siculum is reported. this compound was found in all parts of  the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (s(s)r(c))-s-methyl- and (r(s)r(c))-(e)-s-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and  3, respectively). in addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a ch2cl2 extract of the bulbs. structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily nmr and ms) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9  are reported.

TI  == cloning of the glutamine synthetase gene from group b streptococci.
AB  == the glna gene from the human pathogen streptococcus agalactiae was cloned from a  genomic library prepared with the lambda phage vector lambdadashii. a 4.6-kb dna  fragment of one of the recombinant phages was subcloned in puc18. this escherichia coli clone expressed a 52-kda protein encoded by a 1,341-bp open reading frame. the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame and the deduced  amino acid sequence shared a significant degree of homology with the sequences of other glutamine synthetases (gs). the highest homology was between our deduced protein and gs of gram-positive bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus. plasmids with the cloned streptococcal glna were able to complement e. coli glna mutants grown on minimal media. rabbit antisera to streptococcal gs recombinant protein recognized not only the recombinant protein but also a similar-sized band in mutanolysin extracts of all  group b streptococcal strains tested, regardless of polysaccharide type or surface protein profile. the amino acid sequence of the deduced protein had similarities to other streptococcal cell-surface-bound proteins. the possible functional role of the immunological features of streptococcal gs is discussed.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
