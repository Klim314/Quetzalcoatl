TI  == oral administration of bifidobacterium longum prevents gut-derived pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis in mice.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on gut-derived sepsis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised mice. methods and results: after oral inoculation of p. aeruginosa, mice were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce leucopenia and translocation of the intestinal p. aeruginosa into blood, thereby producing gut-derived sepsis. in this model, administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu of bifidobacterium longum strain bb536 for 10 days significantly (p < 0.01) increased the survival rate compared with groups of mice administered either with bifidobacterium breve strain atcc 15700 or excipients contained in the probiotic bacterial powder. administration of b. longum significantly decreased viable counts of p. aeruginosa in the liver and blood compared with other groups. culture of intestinal contents revealed a significantly lower viable count of p. aeruginosa in the jejunum of b. longum-treated mice compared with other groups of mice. furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that b. longum possessed apparently higher adherent activity to caco-2 cell monolayers and significantly suppressed the adherence of p. aeruginosa to the monolayers of cells compared with other groups. conclusion: oral administration of b. longum protects mice against gut-derived sepsis caused  by p. aeruginosa, and the effect may be due to interference of p. aeruginosa adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. significance and impact of this study:  this study demonstrated that oral administration of b. longum bb536 is effective  to protect against opportunistic infection with drug-resistant bacteria such as p. aeruginosa. the results suggest that probiotics may play an important role even in the immunocompromised patients.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
