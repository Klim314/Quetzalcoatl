in vitro killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp.  by human neutrophil cathepsin g and elastase.
the purpose of this study was to compare the killing of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans with that of capnocytophaga spp. by purified cathepsin g and elastase in vitro. both were sensitive to killing by purified cathepsin g, but only the capnocytophaga spp. were killed by elastase. killing by cathepsin g exhibited logarithmic kinetics, was enhanced slightly by alkaline ph, and was enhanced greatly under hypotonic conditions. treatment of cathepsin g with diisopropyl fluorophosphate significantly reduced its bactericidal activity against capnocytophaga spp. but not against escherichia coli or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the bactericidal effects of cathepsin g against capnocytophaga sputigena and a. actinomycetemcomitans were inhibited by alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin but not by bovine serum albumin. we conclude that (i) cathepsin g kills capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans, (ii) elastase kills capnocytophaga spp., (iii) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin g is enzyme dependent against capnocytophaga spp. and enzyme independent against a. actinomycetemcomitans, and (iv) natural plasma antiproteases may control both enzyme-dependent and enzyme-independent bactericidal activities of cathepsin g.
