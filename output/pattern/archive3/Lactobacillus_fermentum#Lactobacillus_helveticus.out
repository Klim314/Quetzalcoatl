isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in inner mongolia.
from 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in inner mongolia autonomous region of china, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. the dominant lactobacilli species were identified as l. casei (17 strains), l. helveticus (10 strains) and l. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), l. paracasei (3 strains), l. kefiranofaciens (2 strains), l. curvatus (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and w. kandleri (1 strain). the ph values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. in isolates, l. casei zhang, l. helveticus zl12-1, and l. plantarum bx6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in mrs with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. moreover 16s rdna was conducted to confirm the identification.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e. homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.
conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in laf and laf.
[bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
