TI  == bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  == the bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (ivdus) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-ivdus). the ivdu abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "streptococcus milleri" (46%). the commonly encountered anaerobes were fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented prevotella species (22%), peptostreptococcus micros (17%), actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and veillonella species (13%). the non-ivdu isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. s. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "s. milleri" (19%), and streptococcus pyogenes (16%). the main groups of anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (35%), bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). overall, 67% of the ivdu isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-ivdu isolates. of the specimens from ivdus and non-ivdus, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. sixty-four percent of the patients  had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.
