biodiversity, dynamics and ecology of bacterial community during grape marc storage for the production of grappa.
the italian spirit obtained from grape marc, grappa, is produced by an extended storage of the marc which allows alcoholic fermentation. bacterial populations can develop and are associated with off-flavour production. grape marc acidification before storage is a common practice in distilleries to control bacterial proliferation. few studies have been published on the microbial biodiversity in grape marc and no information exists about microbiology of acidified marcs and physiological properties needed for colonizing such an environment. the aim of this study was to investigate the composition and dynamics of grape marc bacterial populations during the long-period storage by microbiological analyses of acidified and untreated marcs. eight bacterial species were identified by ardra - 16s rrna sequencing at the beginning of the fermentation. among them the bacterial species of tatumella terrea, acetobacter ghanensis and tatumella ptyseos were identified for the first time in a wine environment. in later stages oenococcus oeni and members of the lactobacillus plantarum group became dominant in acidified and non-acidified grape marc, respectively. further molecular typing of l. plantarum isolates yielded 39 strains. to explain the prevalence of l. plantarum in untreated samples, all strains were tested for potential antimicrobial activity and for biofilm formation ability. although no antimicrobial activity was found, many strains exhibited the ability to form a biofilm, which may confer an ecological advantage to these strains and their dominance during marc storage.
coculture-inducible bacteriocin activity of lactobacillus plantarum strain j23 isolated from grape must.
detection and characterization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum strain j23, recovered from a grape must sample in spain, have been carried out. bacteriocin activity was degraded by proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, alfa-chymotrypsin, papaine, protease, proteinase k and acid proteases), and it was stable at high temperatures (121 degrees c, 20min), in a wide range of ph (1-12), and after treatment with organic solvents. l. plantarum j23 showed antimicrobial activity against oenococcus oeni, and a range of lactobacillus and pediococcus species. bacteriocin production was detected in liquid media only when j23 was cocultivated with some inducing bacteria, and induction took place when intact cells or 55 degrees c heated cells of the inducer were cocultivated with j23, but not with their autoclaved cells. bacteriocin activity of j23 was not induced by high initial j23 inocula, and it was detected in cocultures during the exponential phase. the presence of ethanol or acidic ph in the media reduced bacteriocin production in the cocultures of j23 with the inducing bacteria. the presence of plantaricin-related plnef and plnj genes was detected by pcr and sequencing. nevertheless, negative results were obtained for plna, plnk, plnc8, pls and plw genes.
isolation, purification and partial characterization of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum.
lactobacillus plantarum 423, isolated from sorghum beer, produces a bacteriocin (plantaricin 423) which is inhibitory to several food spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes, enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp. and staphylococcus spp. plantaricin 423 is resistant to treatment at 80 degrees c, but loses 50% of its activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c and 75% of its activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c, 15 min). plantaricin 423 remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 and is inactivated when treated with pepsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and proteinase k. plantaricin 423 was partially purified and its size estimated at 3.5 kda, as determined by tricine-sds-page. the mechanism of activity of plantaricin 423 is weakly bactericidal, as determined against oenococcus oeni (previously leuconostoc oenos). high dna homology was obtained between the plasmid dna of strain 423 and the pediocin pa-1 operon of pediococcus acidilactici pac 1.0, suggesting that plantaricin 423 is plasmid-encoded and related to the pediocin gene cluster.
