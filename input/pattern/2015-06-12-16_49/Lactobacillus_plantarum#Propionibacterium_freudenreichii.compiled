TI  - Production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  - In order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. Four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains Lactobacillus brevis LBRZ7, L. buchneri LBRZ6, L. plantarum X2, L. paracasei RN5, L. sanfranciscensis R and L. fermentum LBRH10 and the probiotic strain Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii NBIMCC 327. The starter sourdoughs that include Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii NBIMCC 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis, B. mesentericus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp. and Rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.The application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (LA) were incubated with LA in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid (VA) formation. The main CLA products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-CLA; RA) and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, were labelled at C-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. Traces of trans-10,cis-12-CLA formed were labelled to a much lower extent. In pure culture, Bifidobacterium breve NCFB 2258 formed labelled RA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, Roseburia hominis A2-183T, Roseburia inulinivorans A2-192T and Ruminococcus obeum-like strain A2-162 converted LA to VA, labelled in a manner indicating that VA was formed via C-13-labelled RA. Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii DSM 4902T, a possible probiotic, formed mainly RA with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-CLA and trans-9,trans-11-CLA, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. Ricinoleic acid (12-OH-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form CLA in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to CLA formation described for Lactobacillus plantarum. These results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. Thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of RA formation via a 10-OH-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different CLA isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. A hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-OH-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-CLA formation in pure and mixed cultures.
TI  - A general method for selection of riboflavin-overproducing food grade micro-organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study describes a strategy to select and isolate spontaneous riboflavin-overproducing strains of Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Leuconostoc (Lc.) mesenteroides and Propionibacterium (P.) freudenreichii. RESULTS: The toxic riboflavin analogue roseoflavin was used to isolate natural riboflavin-overproducing variants of the food grade micro-organisms Lb. plantarum, Lc. mesenteroides and P. freudenreichii strains. The method was successfully employed for strains of all three species. The mutation(s) responsible for the observed overproduction of riboflavin were identified for isolates of two species. CONCLUSION: Selection for spontaneous roseoflavin-resistant mutants was found to be a reliable method to obtain natural riboflavin-overproducing strains of a number of species commonly used in the food industry. This study presents a convenient method for deriving riboflavin-overproducing strains of bacterial starter cultures, which are currently used in the food industry, by a non-recombinant methodology. Use of such starter strains can be exploited to increase the vitamin content in certain food products.
TI  - Heterologous expression of a gene encoding cholesterol oxidase in probiotic strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii under the control of native promoters.
AB  - To develop systems for the expression of heterologous genes in probiotic strains  of Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium, we used Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and a modified gene encoding cholesterol oxidase (choA) from Streptomyces sp. to generate working models. The acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (acc) promoter derived from the acc operon of L. plantarum L137 and a previously constructed shuttle vector, pRN14, were used to construct vectors for the expression of heterologous genes in lactic acid bacteria. The concentration of cholesterol oxidase in recombinant L. plantarum carrying choA fused to the NH2-terminal region of the first open reading frame of the acc operon was 3.6 mU/mg of protein. Using the promoters from Propionibacterium, namely, P4, P8, and P138, which enabled high-level expression of choA in Escherichia coli, and a previously constructed shuttle vector pPK705, we constructed expression vectors for Propionibacterium. In recombinant P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii IFO12426, the activities of cholesterol oxidase generated under the control of promoters P4, P8, and P138 were 1.6, 4.3, and 7.2 U/mg of protein, respectively. The expression of heterologous genes may facilitate the production of useful proteins in these economically important bacteria.
TI  - Use of lactic and propionic acid bacteria in the production of fermented parsley  juice.
AB  - Taking into consideration the proliferation rate of Propionibacterium sp. cells,  pH changes and sensory properties of the fermented product obtained, selection of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) was made in order to determine their usefulness for the production of fermented parsley juice. The analysis included 12 strains, belonging to the following species: P. thoenii (4 strains), P. jensenii (6 strains), P. freudenreichii (1 strain) and P. acidipropionici (1 strain). The experiments show that many strains of propionic acid rods develop well in parsley juice, allowing to achieve the desired taste qualities of the product. The Propionibacterium strains selected by elimination were used as components of vaccine containing: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus buchneri and other additives on the fermentation and  aerobic stability of barley silage.
AB  - Whole-plant barley (39.4% dry matter) was treated with various chemical and biological additives to assess their effects on silage fermentation and aerobic stability. Treatments were untreated forage, forage treated with several amounts of Lactobacillus buchneri and enzymes (L. buchneri at 1 x 10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage), forage treated with an inoculant containing (Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, and enzymes), or forage treated with a buffered propionic acid-based additive (0.2% of fresh weight). Sixty-nine d after ensiling, silages treated with L. buchneri and enzymes had lower pH, but had higher concentrations of acetic and propionic acids and higher concentrations of ethanol when compared with untreated silage. Silage treated with the multistrain inoculant containing L. plantarum had lower pH and higher concentrations of lactic acid, but lower concentrations of ammonia-N, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber than did untreated silage. The addition of the buffered propionic acid additive resulted in silage with higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acid compared with untreated silage. Numbers of yeasts in all silages were low at silo opening (less than 3.0 log cfu/g) and were numerically the lowest in silages treated with L. buchneri but only treatment with the intermediate and high level of L. buchneri improved the aerobic stability of silage. Because of the altered fermentation pattern, inoculation with L. buchneri, when applied at equal to or more than 5 x 10(5) cfu/g, and enzymes improved the aerobic stability of barley silage.
