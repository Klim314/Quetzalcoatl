TI  == divergent signaling pathways regulate il-12 production induced by different species of lactobacilli in human dendritic cells.
AB  == recent studies have indicated that different strains of lactobacilli differ in their ability to regulate il-12 production by dendritic cells (dcs), as some strains are stronger inducer of il-12 while other are not and can even inhibit il-12 production stimulated by il-12-inducer lactobacilli. in this report we demonstrate that lactobacillus reuteri 5289, as previously described for other strains of l. reuteri, can inhibit dc production of il-12 induced by lactobacilllus acidophilus ncfm. remarkably, l. reuteri 5289 was able to inhibit  il-12 production induced not only by lactobacilli, as so far reported, but also by bacteria of different genera, including pathogens. we investigated in human dcs the signal transduction pathways involved in the inhibition of il-12 production induced by l. reuteri 5289, showing that this potential anti-inflammatory activity, which is also accompanied by an elevated il-10 production, is associated to a prolonged phosphorilation of erk1/2 map kinase pathway. improved understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms exerted by lactobacilli is crucial for a more precise employment of these commensal bacteria as probiotics in human immune-mediated pathologies, such as allergies or inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == characterization of the effects of three lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to  do so. the present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. a chicken macrophage cell line, mq-ncsu, was co-cultured with the three live lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. l. acidophilus and l. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (no) production and phagocytosis, while l. reuteri did not. in fact, l reuteri was shown to inhibit no production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with lps. the results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of l. acidophilus and l. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of l. reuteri.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == saccharomyces boulardii expresses neuraminidase activity selective for alpha2,3-linked sialic acid that decreases helicobacter pylori adhesion to host cells.
AB  == helicobacter pylori is a major causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is an established risk factor for gastric malignancy. antibiotic combination therapy can eradicate h. pylori. as these same regimens can evoke adverse effects and resistance, new alternative therapies or adjunctive treatments are needed. a probiotic approach may provide a novel strategy for h. pylori treatment. in the current study, two probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri, and a probiotic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii, were evaluated for their ability to influence h. pylori viability, adherence to gastric and duodenal cells, as well as the effect of s. boulardii on cell surface expression of sialic acid. our results indicate that s. boulardii contains neuraminidase activity selective for alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid. this neuraminidase activity removes surface alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid, the ligand  for the sialic acid-binding h. pylori adhesin, which in turn, inhibits h. pylori  adherence to duodenal epithelial cells.

TI  == use of probiotics for management of acute gastroenteritis: a position paper by the espghan working group for probiotics and prebiotics.
AB  == the use of probiotics has been suggested in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (age) in addition to early rehydration and avoidance of dietary restrictions. this document provides recommendations for the use of probiotics for the treatment of age in previously healthy infants and children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials (rcts) published subsequently to these reviews. the recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 rcts that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. the grade system developed  by the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations working group, was used to grade the strength of evidence and grades of recommendations used in these guidelines. it offers 4 categories of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) and 2 categories of the strength of recommendation (strong or weak). the use of the following probiotics  (in alphabetical order) may be considered in the management of children with age  in addition to rehydration therapy: lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation) and saccharomyces boulardii (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). less compelling evidence is available for lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation) and heat-inactivated lactobacillus acidophilus lb (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation). the latter, although traditionally discussed with other probiotics, does not fit with the definition of probiotics.  other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but evidence of their  efficacy is weak or preliminary.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant produced by lactobacilli isolates, biofilm formation and aggregation ability.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of biosurfactant extracted from ten lactobacilli species isolated from egyptian dairy products. the produced biosurfactants showed distinct antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities against several pathogenic microorganisms. furthermore,  lactobacilli isolates were studied for biofilm formation and lactic acid production in different growth media. all lactobacilli isolates produced biofilm  on polystyrene surface in all media tested to different degrees. l. acidophilus showed the highest biofilm formation in rogosa medium. however, the highest lactic acid production was recorded by l. brevis (39.63 g/l), followed by l. reuteri (33.32 g/l) in mrs medium. evaluation based on in vitro studies including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with three pathogenic bacterial strains was further analyzed. all lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 51.12% to 78.17% assessed at 5 h of incubation). the lactobacilli isolates co-aggregate with the tested bacterial strains to different degrees; among them l. delbrueckii showed the highest scores of co-aggregation with candida albicans atc70014, reaching 59.37%. the aggregation ability exhibited by  the isolated lactobacilli, together with the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties observed for their biosurfactants, opens future prospects for their use against microorganisms responsible for diseases and infections and as effective probiotic strains.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
AB  == a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph  2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species  lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility  patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent  in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves  (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production  though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a  reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. methods and results: to fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time pcr assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate  identification and quantification of five commercially important lactobacillus species. the developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of  the species lact. acidophilus, lact. brevis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. conclusions: with the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) cfu ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) cfu ml(-1) of probiotic strains. significance and impact of the study: the real-time pcr assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic  rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus reuteri. the rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. the symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering ldl-c, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and ldl-c than the phytosterol-containing treatment. the phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. in conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to  lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.

TI  == mucosal immunology and probiotics.
AB  == the cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. this recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (dc) activation, polarizing the subsequent t cell activity toward th1 (e.g. lactobacillus (lb) acidophilus),  th2 (lb.reuteri and bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, th17 responses induced by specific strains such as lb.rhamnosus gg and lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as dcs. we also highlight our own experiences in modulating dc functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri crl 1098 and lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1014 differently reduce in vitro immunotoxic effect induced by ochratoxin a.
AB  == ochratoxin a (ota) is a widespread mycotoxin contaminating several food products  which causes detrimental health effects. the ability of lactobacillus reuteri crl 1098 and lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1014 to prevent ota effects on tnf-alpha and il-10 production and apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was investigated. membrane rafts participation in these  responses was also evaluated. l. reuteri reduced by 29% the ota inhibition of tnf-alpha production whereas l. acidophilus increased 8 times the tnf-alpha production by ota treated-pbmc. also, both bacteria reversed apoptosis induced by ota by 32%. however, neither of the bacteria reversed the ota inhibition on il-10 production. on the other hand, the lactobacilli were less effective to reverse ota effects on disrupted-rafts pbmc. this study shows that two lactobacilli strains can reduce some negative ota effects, being membrane rafts integrity necessary to obtain better results. also, the results highlight the potential capacity of some lactobacilli strains usually included in natural dietary components in milk-derived products and cereals feed, to reduce ota toxicity once ingested by humans or animals.

TI  == differential cytokine expression in t-cell subsets of chicken caecal tonsils co-cultured with three species of lactobacillus.
AB  == members of the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the development of t-cells. little is known about responses of intestinal t-cell subsets of chickens to commensal bacteria. therefore, we set out to characterise cytokine responses in t-cells after exposure to lactobacilli. caecal tonsil mononuclear cells were isolated and co-cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius for 12 hours. subsequently the cd4+ and cd8+ cells were fractionated by flow cytometry and the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as toll-like receptor 21 (tlr21) was determined. the results demonstrated that chicken cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells express tlr21 and that the various isolates of lactobacilli differentially induces the expression of interleukin 10, interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor beta. our results demonstrate that different lactobacillus species have the capacity to regulate intestinal t-cell responses and that these responses may be  important to intestinal homeostasis.

TI  == protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees c.
AB  == the survival of single strains of bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees c) aerobic storage conditions. when the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45  mm), 102-103 cfu/ml of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of b. breve and b. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. following  refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mm), butyric (0-2 mm), propionic (5-16 mm) and  lactic acids (1-48 mm) were produced during the growth of probiotics in bhi broth at 37 degrees c, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed.  when calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. at least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. significantly higher levels of b. breve, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. b. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. these results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

AB  == the aim of this study was to improve the bioavailability of the dietary phenolic  acids in flours from whole grain barley and oat groat following fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (lab) exhibiting high feruloyl esterase activity (fae). the  highest increase of free phenolic acids was observed after fermentation with three probiotic strains, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus reuteri sd2112, and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, with maximum increases from 2.55 to 69.91 mug g(-1) dm and from 4.13 to 109.42 mug g(-1) dm in whole grain barley and oat groat, respectively. interestingly, higher amounts of bound phenolic acids were detected after both water treatment and lab fermentation in whole grain barley, indicating higher bioaccessibility, whereas some decrease was detected in oat groat. to conclude, cereal fermentation with specific probiotic strains can lead to significant increase of free phenolic acids, thereby improving their bioavailability.

TI  == transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. thirty-seven lactobacillus spp. strains isolated  from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in de man, rogosa and sharpe broth in a microplate assay. almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the lactobacillus acidophilus group) and  to tetracycline (mic>/=128 mug/ml). only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. the transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using l. acidophilus strain 4m14e (emr), lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5m14e (cmr), lactobacillus salivarius strain 5c14c (emr), and the 4g14l and 3c14c strains of lactobacillus reuteri (cmr) showed a frequency of  approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different  combinations. the exception was the l. salivarius 5c14c (emr) and l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. in vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating l. acidophilus 4m14e (emr) with l. reuteri 3c14c (cmr), l. reuteri 4g14l (cmr) or l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. this possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri modulate cytokine responses in gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotavirus.
AB  == probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to alleviate inflammation, enhance the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccines, or reduce the severity of rotavirus diarrhoea. although the mechanisms are not clear, the differential th1/th2/th3-driving capacities and modulating effects on cytokine production of different lab strains may be the key. our goal was to delineate the influence of  combining two probiotic strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri on the development of cytokine responses in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotavirus (hrv). we demonstrated that hrv alone, or hrv plus  lab, but not lab alone, initiated serum cytokine responses, as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of ifn-alpha, ifn-gamma, il-12, and il-10 at  postinoculation day (pid) 2 in the hrv only and lab+hrv+ pigs compared to lab only and lab-hrv- pigs. peak cytokine responses coincided with the peak of hrv replication. lab further enhanced the th1 and th2 cytokine responses to hrv infection as indicated by significantly higher concentrations of il-12, ifn-gamma, il-4 and il-10 in the lab+hrv+ pigs compared to the lab-hrv+ pigs. the lab+hrv+ pigs maintained relatively constant concentrations of tgf-beta compared  to the hrv only group which had a significant increase at pid 2 and decrease at pid 7, suggesting a regulatory role of lab in maintaining gut homeostasis. at pid 28, cytokine secreting cell (csc) responses, measured by elispot, showed increased th1 (il-12, ifn-gamma) csc numbers in the lab+hrv+ and lab-hrv+ groups  compared to lab only and lab-hrv- pigs, with significantly increased il-12 cscs in spleen and pbmcs and ifn-gamma cscs in spleen of the lab+hrv+ group. thus, hrv infection alone, but not lab alone was effective in inducing cytokine responses but lab significantly enhanced both th1 and th2 cytokines in hrv-infected pigs. lab may also help to maintain immunological homeostasis during hrv infection by regulating tgf-beta production.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == grape antioxidant dietary fiber stimulates lactobacillus growth in rat cecum.
AB  == the digesta is a highly active biological system where epithelial cells, microbiota, nondigestible dietary components, and a large number of metabolic products interact. the gut microbiota can be modulated by both endogenous and exogenous substrates. undigested dietary residues are substrates for colonic microbiota and may influence gut microbial ecology. the objective of this work was to study the capacity of grape antioxidant dietary fiber (gadf), which is rich in polyphenols, to modify the bacterial profile in the cecum of rats. male adult wistar rats were fed for 4 wk with diets containing either cellulose or gadf as dietary fiber. the effect of gadf on bacterial growth was evaluated in vitro and on the cecal microbiota of rats using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the results showed that gadf intake stimulates proliferation of lactobacillus and slightly affects the composition of bifidobacterium species. gadf was also found to have a stimulative effect on lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus in vitro. these findings suggest that the consumption of a diet rich in plant foods with high dietary fiber and polyphenol content may enhance the gastrointestinal health of the host  through microbiota modulation. practical application: grape antioxidant fiber combines nutritional and physiological properties of dietary fiber and natural antioxidants from grapes. grape antioxidant fiber could be used as an ingredient  for functional foods and as a dietary supplement to increase the intake of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

AB  == commensal microbes in the intestine are in constant interaction with host cells and play a role in shaping the immune system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius are members of the chicken intestinal microbiota and have been shown to induce different cytokine profiles in mononuclear cells in vitro. the objective of the present study was to examine  the effects of these bacteria individually or in combination on the induction of  antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. the birds received lactobacilli weekly via oral gavage starting on day of hatch and subsequently, at 14 and 21 days, were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc), keyhole limpet  hemocyanin (klh), newcastle disease virus vaccine, and infectious bursal disease  virus vaccine. antibody responses in serum were measured weekly for 4 weeks beginning on the day of primary immunization. the cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at 21 days postimmunization by measurement of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) production in splenocytes stimulated with inactivated vaccine antigens. l. salivarius-treated birds had significantly more serum antibody to srbc and klh than birds that were not treated with probiotics. l. salivarius-treated birds also had decreased cell-mediated immune responses to recall antigen stimulation. l. reuteri treatment did not significantly affect the systemic immune response, while l. acidophilus treatment increased the antibody response to klh. these results indicate that systemic antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses can be modulated by oral treatment with lactobacilli but that these bacteria may vary in their ability to modulate the immune response.

TI  == quantitative transcript analysis of the inducible expression system psip: comparison of the overexpression of lactobacillus spp. beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: two sets of overlapping genes, laclmreu and laclmaci, encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, have previously been cloned and expressed using the psip vector system and lactobacillus plantarum wcsf1 as host. despite the high similarity between these laclm genes and the use of identical cloning and expression strategies, strains harboring laclmreu produced about twenty-fold more beta-galactosidase than strains containing laclmaci. results: in this study, the  plasmid copy numbers (pcn) of expression vectors peh9r (laclmreu) and peh9a (laclmaci) as well as the transcription levels of both laclm genes were compared  using quantitative pcr methods. analyses of parallel fermentations of l. plantarum harboring either peh9r or peh9a showed that the expression plasmids were present in similar copy numbers. however, transcript levels of laclm from l. reuteri (peh9r) were up to 18 times higher than those of laclm from l. acidophilus (peh9a). as a control, it was shown that the expression levels of regulatory genes involved in pheromone-induced promoter activation were similar in both strains. conclusion: the use of identical expression strategies for highly similar genes led to very different mrna levels. the data indicate that this difference is primarily caused by translational effects that are likely to affect both mrna synthesis rates and mrna stability. these translational effects  thus seem to be a dominant determinant for the success of gene expression efforts in lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == development of gammadelta t cell subset responses in gnotobiotic pigs infected with human rotaviruses and colonized with probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == gammadelta t cell responses are induced by various viral and bacterial infections. different gammadelta t cells contribute to activation and regulation  of the inflammatory response and to epithelial repair. how gammadelta t cells respond to rotavirus infection and how the colonization of probiotics influences  the gammadelta t cell response were unknown. in this study, we evaluated by multicolor flow cytometry the frequencies and distribution of total gammadelta t  cells and three major subsets (cd2-cd8-, cd2+cd8- and cd2+cd8+) in ileum, spleen  and blood of gnotobiotic (gn) pigs at early (3-5 days) and late phases (28 days)  after rotavirus infection. the gn pigs were inoculated with the virulent human rotavirus wa strain and colonized with a mixture of two strains of probiotics lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri. in naive pigs, the highest frequency of total gammadelta t cells was found in blood, followed by spleen and  ileum at the early age (8-10 days old) whereas in older pigs (32 days of age) the highest frequency of total gammadelta t cells was found in ileum and spleen followed by blood. rotavirus infection significantly increased frequencies of intestinal total gammadelta t cells and the putatively regulatory cd2+cd8+ gammadelta t cell subset and decreased frequencies of the putatively proinflammatory cd8- subsets in ileum, spleen and blood at post-infection days (pid) 3 or 5. the three gammadelta t cell subsets distributed and responded differently after rotavirus infection and/or lactobacilli colonization. the cd2+cd8+ subset contributed the most to the expansion of total gammadelta t cells after rotavirus infection in ileum because more than 77% of the total gammadelta  t cells there were cd2+cd8+ cells. there was an additive effect between lactobacilli and rotavirus in inducing total gammadelta t cell expansion in ileum at pid 5. the overall effect of lactobacilli colonization versus rotavirus infection on frequencies of the cd2+cd8+ gammadelta t cell subset in ileum was similar; however, rotavirus-infected pigs maintained significantly higher frequencies of cd8- subsets in ileum than lactobacilli-colonized pigs. the dynamic gammadelta t cell responses suggest that gammadelta t cell subsets may play important roles in different stages of immune responses after rotavirus infection and probiotic colonization. the knowledge on the kinetics and distribution patterns of gammadelta t cell subsets in naive pigs and after rotavirus infection or lactobacilli colonization provides the foundation for further mechanistic studies of their functions.

TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == intestinal lactobacilli and the dc-sign gene for their recognition by dendritic cells play a role in the aetiology of allergic manifestations.
AB  == diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in westernized communities. the development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. the present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific lactobacillus species and genetic variations in dc-sign, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) and sensitization in infancy. within the koala birth cohort study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five lactobacillus species: l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri. eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the dc-sign gene were genotyped in these children. allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of ad and sensitization (specific ige) at age 2 years. l. rhamnosus (31.5 %), l. paracasei  (31.3 %) and l. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas l. casei (2.5 %) and l. reuteri (<1 %)  were rare. colonization with l. paracasei decreased the risk of ad significantly  (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of l. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). two dc-sign polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. the present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in dc-sign in association with  the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.

AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == comparison of expression vectors in lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  == the synthesis of heterologous proteins in lactobacilli is strongly influenced by  the promoter selected for the expression. in addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression in lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris mg1363, in lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t) and in five l. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. the promoters of the lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer  protein gene (slp), l. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhl) and enterococcal rrna adenine n-6-methyltransferase gene (ermb) were fused to the coding sequence of egfp and inserted into the backbone of the ptrkh3 shuttle vector (ptrkh3-slpgfp, ptrkh3-ldhgfp, ptrkh3-ermgfp). besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the  egfp fluorescence in transformed clones using the qubit() fluorometer. ermb proved to be the most effective promoter in l. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent egfp (ml od(stationary culture))(-1). under the same conditions, the ldhl promoter produced 2.66 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent egfp (ml od(stationary culture))(-1). even though the slp promoter was efficient in l. lactis spp. cremoris mg1363, it was nearly inactive both in l. reuteri dsm 20016(t) and in l. reuteri isolates.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit  the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.
AB  == aims: to identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae. methods and results: a total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell  protein profiles. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16s rdna sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, bifidobacterium thermophilum). according to their minimum inhibitory  concentrations, four strains (ent. faecium, lact. reuteri, lact. amylovorus, bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(b) determinant. a cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. the brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of lact. salivarius, bif. thermophilum, ent. faecium and b. subtilis. conclusions: three porcine strains of ent. faecium, bif. thermophilum and b. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: for the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. these findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed  additives for prevention of swine dysentery.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == toll-like receptor and innate cytokine responses induced by lactobacilli colonization and human rotavirus infection in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlr) play an important role in the recognition of microbes by host sentinel cells that leads to the subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses. in this study, we evaluated the patterns of tlr2-, tlr3- and tlr9-expressing antigen presenting cells (apcs) in spleen and blood of gnotobiotic (gn) pigs after colonization with a mixture of two strains of lactic  acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri or infection with the virulent human rotavirus (hrv) wa strain. we also assessed the influence of lab on tlr and serum innate cytokine responses induced by hrv. distributions of subpopulations of apcs [cd14+/-swc3+cd11r1- monocytes/macrophages and cd14+/-swc3+cd11r1+ conventional dendritic cells (cdcs)] were described in our previous report (zhang, w., wen, k., azevedo, m.s., gonzalez, a.m., saif, l.j., li, g., yousef, a.e., yuan, l., 2008. lactic acid bacterial colonization and human rotavirus infection influence distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells in neonatal gnotobiotic  pigs. vet. immunol. immunopathol. 121, pp. 222-231). we demonstrated that lab induced strong tlr2-expressing apc responses in blood and spleen, hrv induced a tlr3 response in spleen, and tlr9 responses were induced by either hrv (in spleen) or lab (in blood). lab and hrv have an additive effect on tlr2- and tlr9-expressing apc responses, consistent with the adjuvant effect of lab. overall, the frequencies of tlr-expressing cd14+ apcs were higher than cd14- apcs. lab enhanced the ifn-gamma and il-4 responses in serum, but it had a suppressive effect on the tlr3- and tlr9-expressing cd14- apc responses in spleen and the serum ifn-alpha response induced by hrv. these results elucidated the systemic tlr2-, tlr3-, and tlr9-expressing monocyte/macrophage and cdc responses  after hrv infection, lab colonization, and the two combined. our findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of lab's adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccines and the diverse innate and adaptive immune responses induced by commensal lab colonization versus rotavirus infection and the interactions between them.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == high-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sakei using a sakacin p-based expression system.
AB  == this work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri l103, lactobacillus acidophilus r22, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, and lactobacillus sakei lb790. these enzymes  consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kda, which are encoded by two  overlapping genes, lacl and lacm, respectively. we have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors psip403 and psip409, which are based on the  sakacin p operon of l. sakei ( sorvig et al. microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. sakei lb790.  results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 u/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the laclm genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of l. plantarum wcfs1 harboring the plasmid peh3r containing the laclm gene from l. reuteri l103. these cultivations yielded approximately 23 000  u of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. to further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. the properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri l103. the presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == influence of probiotic lactobacilli colonization on neonatal b cell responses in  a gnotobiotic pig model of human rotavirus infection and disease.
AB  == the goal of this study was to define the impact of colonization of gnotobiotic (gn) pigs with lactic acid bacteria (lab) on development of intestinal and systemic b cell responses to human rotavirus (hrv). the lab-specific and total b  cell responses were also assessed. gn pigs were inoculated with lab (lactobacillus acidophilus and l. reuteri) and virulent wa strain hrv (lab+hrv+), hrv only (lab-hrv+), lab only (lab+hrv-) or mock (lab-hrv-). the hrv infection induced similar hrv-specific intestinal and systemic antibody and b cell responses in pigs with or without lab, whereas lab significantly enhanced total intestinal iga secreting cell responses and total serum igm and intestinal igm and igg titers. the lab colonization did not reduce hrv shedding or diarrhea, this may be partly due to the short time interval between the first lab feeding and hrv inoculation. further studies are needed with longer time for lab to establish before hrv inoculation. however, our studies demonstrate that gn pigs infected with hrv develop a similar magnitude of virus-specific b cell responses  as those of hrv-infected and lab colonized pigs. lab colonization alone is not as efficient in promoting intestinal b cell responses, as is hrv infection.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial colonization and human rotavirus infection influence distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == despite accumulating knowledge of porcine macrophages and dendritic cells (dcs) from in vitro studies, information regarding monocytes/macrophages and dcs in lymphoid tissues of enteric pathogen-infected neonatal animals in vivo is limited. in this study we evaluated the influence of commensal bacterial [two strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus and l. reuteri]  colonization and rotavirus infection on distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional dcs (cdcs) in ileum, spleen and blood. gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with lab and virulent wa strain human rotavirus  (hrv) (lab+hrv+), hrv only (lab-hrv+), lab only (lab+hrv-) or mock (lab-hrv-). the cdcs were characterized as swc3(+)cd11r1(+), whereas monocytes/macrophages were identified as swc3(+)cd11r1(-) by flow cytometry in the gnotobiotic pigs at  10 days of age. infection with hrv alone activated/recruited significantly more monocytes/macrophages to the intestine than lab colonization and 56% versus 28% of these cells expressed cd14. colonization with lab alone also significantly increased the frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cdcs and the cd14 expression on monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen compared to the controls. lab colonization plus hrv infection significantly reduced macrophage and cdc frequencies in spleen compared to lab colonization or hrv infection alone, suggesting that lab colonization down-regulated hrv- infection-induced monocyte/macrophage activation/recruitment at the systemic lymphoid tissue. these results illustrated the distribution of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cdcs and the frequencies of cd14 expression on these cells in intestinal and systemic  lymphoid tissues in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by lab versus infection by an enteric pathogen hrv and will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonates.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactobacillus species having potential for use  as probiotic cultures for dogs.
AB  == the need to control pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract of dogs is  a growing concern. there is interest in using probiotics such as species of lactobacillus to help control canine intestinal infections. for successful use as a probiotic, the bacterial species should be of canine intestinal origin since these species exhibit host specificity. serial dilutions of freshly voided dog feces were plated on lactobacillus selection (lbs) agar to isolate the cultures.  isolates were identified based on gram stain, catalase test, and fermentation patterns using api 50 ch kits. all potential isolates were compared for bile resistance based on relative ability to grow in broth containing 0.3% oxgall, the ability to inhibit salmonella typhimurium in associative broth cultures, and the  production of reuterin. of the lactobacilli isolated, lactobacillus reuteri was the dominant species. however, some cultures of l. acidophilus also were isolated. we found variations among the isolates of l. reuteri and l. acidophilus with respect to bile tolerance. in general, isolates of l. reuteri appeared to be more bile resistant than were isolates of l. acidophilus. there were also variations in the ability to inhibit growth of s. typhimurium. some isolates of l. reuteri produced reuterin while others did not.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == cloacal lactobacillus isolates from broilers often display resistance toward tetracycline antibiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus, l. reuteri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius strains isolated from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 20 different farms in belgium were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline. acquired resistance percentages to these antibiotics were extremely high for l. crispatus, l. reuteri, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius (75%-100%). l. amylovorus on the  contrary, displayed lower resistance percentages (25%) toward minocycline and tetracycline. in several strains, resistance against the tetracycline antibiotics was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(k), tet(l), tet(m),  tet(w), and tet(z). to our knowledge, this is the first report of tet(z) in lactobacilli and tet(k), tet(l), and tet(w) in lactobacilli identified to species level. our findings strengthen the evidence of intestinal lactobacillus species acting as a pool of antimicrobial resistance genes urging the need for prudent use of tetracycline antibiotics in poultry production.

AB  == twenty-six out of 46 representative lactic acid bacteria (lab) that we isolated from 36 dogs in a previous study were agglutinated by concanavalin a (cona) at a  concentration of 0.1563 mg/ml, while isolates did not agglutinate without the addition of cona. amongst the isolates, l. reuteri, l. mucosae, and e. canintestini agglutinated strongly, while l. gallinarum, l. kitasatonis, l. acidophilus, l. saerimneri, b. animalis ssp. animalis, p. acidilactici, and e. hirae did not agglutinate. cona-agglutination of lab was specifically inhibited by d-glucose, d-galactose, and d-mannose at a concentration of 1.563 mg/ml. among the sugars, cona-agglutination was strongly inhibited by d-mannose, while the inhibition level by d-glucose and d-galactose were lower than that of d-mannose.  cona- agglutination of all the lab isolates was inhibited by d-mannose, except for l. reuteri (one species) and l. mucosae (two species). cona-agglutination of  bifidobacterium spp. was inhibited by only d-mannose. based on our results, cona-agglutination of lab seems to be strain-specific, but not species-specific.

TI  == [influence of a xylanase feed additive on lactobacillus species in the jejunum of piglets].
AB  == rrna extracts from the jejunum of rearing piglets fed a wheat/rye based diet with or without a xylanase feed additive were hybridized against eight lactobacillus spp. specific digoxigenin labelled oligonucleotide probes. known concentrations of sample- or culture rna extracts were used to calibrate and quantify hybridization signals from different sample extracts and hybridizations. the xylanase feed additive tended to increase total eubacterial rrna in the terminal  jejunum, probably a result of increased lactobacillus spp. rrna in the central and terminal jejunum. however, individual animal variations were high. l. reuteri was the major lactobacillus species followed by l. acidophilus and l. mucosae. l. amylophilus and l. crispatus were not detected in all rna extracts. the results of this study show that the xylanase feed additive modifies lactobacillus spp. populations on the species level in piglets in addition to their well known effects on digesta viscosity and nutrient digestibility. the implications of these effects for the intestinal microbiota require further analysis.

AB  == one strain of lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of lactobacillus reuteri and  lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at ph 2.5 and were examined for their ability  to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. there was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. l. salivarius g11 and l. amylovorus s6 adhered to the ht-29 epithelial cell line. cell-free supernatant of l. amylovorus s6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including c. perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, edwardsiella tarda, and aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

TI  == biocatalysis of linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == cla refers to a group of geometrical and positional isomers of linoleic acid (la) with conjugated double bonds. cla has been reported to have diverse health benefits and biological properties. traditional organic synthesis is highly capital-intensive and results in an isomeric mixture of cla isomers. biotechnology presents new alternatives to traditional lipid manufacturing methods. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of protein isolation procedures on linoleate isomerase (lai) recovery from microbial cells and biocatalysis of la to cla. protein isolation experiments were carried out using lactobacillus acidophilus l1 and two strains of lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272 and atcc 55739). under the same assay conditions, atcc 55739 had the highest lai activity among the microbial cultures examined in this study. efficiency of cell lysis methods, which included various combinations of lysozyme and mutanolysin treatments in combination with sonication and osmotic rupture of  cells with liquid nitrogen, was very low. although treatment of cell material with a detergent (octylthioglucoyranoside) freed a significant amount of lai activity into the solution, it was not sufficient to recover all the lai activity from the residual cells. crude lai preparations produced mainly the cis-9,trans-11 cla isomer. time and substrate/protein ratio had a significant effect on biocatalysis of la to cla. it appears that the mechanism and kinetics of enzymatic conversion of la to cla are quite complex and requires further research using pure lai preparations.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == post-natal development of the porcine microbiota composition and activities.
AB  == the current study describes the development of the porcine microbiota and its metabolic activities during the neonatal and weaning period. using 16s rrna-based approaches, we first analysed the ileal and colonic microbiota of neonatal piglets at days 2, 5 and 12 after birth. to further investigate the effect of weaning at 3 weeks of age, 19-day-old piglets (n = 64) were randomly allocated into two groups. half of the piglets remained with their sows throughout the study, while the remaining piglets were weaned. as revealed by sequence analysis  of 16s rrna gene amplicons, the samples of 2-day-old piglets harboured a consortium of bacteria related to escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus. moreover, species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assays unveiled that l. sobrius and l. reuteri predominated in the ileal samples of the neonatal  and unweaned piglets with population levels up to 7 x 10(8) cells per gram of lumen content. following weaning, however, these two lactobacilli were detected at significantly lower levels (< 10(3)) in the ileal samples. furthermore, a shift in composition and metabolic activities of the predominant microbiota, and  emergence of clostridia and e. coli, were encountered in the intestinal samples of the piglets after the early post-weaning period.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == extracellular homopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides from intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to characterize lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of ducks or pigs  with respect to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides (hops) and oligosaccharides. methods and results: lactobacillus strains of duck or pig origin were screened for hops synthesis and >25% of the isolates produced fructans or glucans from sucrose. glucan-forming strains were found within the species lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus animalis and fructan-forming strains were found within lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus acidophilus. the glucan-forming strains of l. reuteri but not l. animalis produced glucose-oligosaccharides in additon to the respective polymers, and two fructan-forming strains of l. acidophilus produced kestose. genes coding  for glycosyltransferases were detected by pcr and partially characterized by sequence analysis. conclusions: a large proportion of lactobacilli from intestinal habitats produce hops from sucrose and polysaccharide formation is generally associated with the formation of glucose- and fructose oligosaccharides. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the metabolic potential of intestinal lactobacilli contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of autochthony in intestinal habitats. moreover, this is the first report of glucose-oligosaccharide production during growth of lactobacilli, and one novel fructosyltransferase and one novel glucansucrase were partially characterized on the genetic level.

TI  == influence of dietary zinc oxide and copper sulfate on the gastrointestinal ecosystem in newly weaned piglets.
AB  == dietary doses of 2,500 ppm zno-zn reduced bacterial activity (atp accumulation) in digesta from the gastrointestinal tracts of newly weaned piglets compared to that in animals receiving 100 ppm zno-zn. the amounts of lactic acid bacteria (mrs counts) and lactobacilli (rogosa counts) were reduced, whereas coliforms (macconkey counts) and enterococci (slanetz counts, red colonies) were more numerous in animals receiving the high zno dose. based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, the colonies on mrs were dominated by three phylotypes, tentatively identified as lactobacillus amylovorus (otu171), lactobacillus reuteri (otu173),  and streptococcus alactolyticus (otu180). the colonies on rogosa plates were dominated by the two lactobacillus phylotypes only. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis supported the observations of three phylotypes of lactic acid bacteria dominating in piglets receiving the low zno dose and of coliforms and enterococci dominating in piglets receiving the high zno dose. dietary doses of 175 ppm cuso(4)-cu also reduced mrs and rogosa counts of stomach contents, but for these animals, the numbers of coliforms were reduced in the cecum and the colon. the influence of zno on the gastrointestinal microbiota resembles the working mechanism suggested for some growth-promoting antibiotics,  namely, the suppression of gram-positive commensals rather than potentially pathogenic gram-negative organisms. reduced fermentation of digestible nutrients  in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract may render more energy available for the host animal and contribute to the growth-promoting effect of high dietary zno doses. dietary cuso(4) inhibited the coliforms and thus potential pathogens as well, but overall the observed effect of cuso(4) was limited compared to that of zno.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == using 16s rrna gene-based approaches, we analyzed the responses of ileal and colonic bacterial communities of weaning piglets to dietary addition of four fermentable carbohydrates (inulin, lactulose, wheat starch, and sugar beet pulp). an enriched diet and a control diet lacking these fermentable carbohydrates were  fed to piglets for 4 days (n = 48), and 10 days (n = 48), and the lumen-associated microbiota were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of amplified 16s rrna genes. bacterial diversities in the ileal and colonic samples were measured by assessing the number of dgge bands and the shannon index of diversity. a higher number of dgge  bands in the colon (24.2 +/- 5.5) than in the ileum (9.7 +/- 4.2) was observed in all samples. in addition, significantly higher diversity, as measured by dgge fingerprint analysis, was detected in the colonic microbial community of weaning  piglets fed the fermentable-carbohydrate-enriched diet for 10 days than in the control. selected samples from the ileal and colonic lumens were also investigated using fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. this revealed a prevalence of lactobacillus reuteri in the ileum and lactobacillus amylovorus-like populations in the ileum and the colon in the piglets fed with fermentable carbohydrates. newly developed  oligonucleotide probes targeting these phylotypes allowed their rapid detection and quantification in the ileum and colon by fish. the results indicate that addition of fermentable carbohydrates supports the growth of specific lactobacilli in the ilea and colons of weaning piglets.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria, in maize porridge with added malted barley.
AB  == a fermented probiotic maize porridge with high energy density and low viscosity was prepared, using maize flour and barley malt. the porridge was fermented with  four probiotic strains (grown separately): lactobacillus reuteri, lb. acidophilus (la5 and 1748) and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains were inoculated at two levels; to obtain approx. 7 or 6 log cfu g(-1) in the porridge at 0 h. the porridge was fermented for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and analysed for viable cell count, ph, organic acids, volatile aromatic compounds and sugar content. the inoculated cell concentration was shown to be particularly important during the first hours of the fermentation period, showing a delayed production of most metabolites in porridge inoculated with approx. 6 log cfu g(-1). most strains reached maximum cell count after 12-h fermentation (7.2-8.2 log cfu g(-1)), with a ph below 4.0.  depending on the strain, lactic acid was produced in amounts ranging from 1360 to 4000 mg kg(-1). lb. reuteri metabolised succinate, while pyruvate and small amounts of diacetyl were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748. high amounts of diacetyl (6 mg kg(-1)) and acetoin (27  mg kg(-1)) were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. rhamnosus gg. porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748, contained acetaldehyde, while both lb. reuteri and lb. rhamnosus gg reduced the acetaldehyde to ethanol. lb. reuteri utilised both maltose and glucose as carbohydrate sources, while lb. acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748 and lb. rhamnosus gg utilised only glucose.

TI  == modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants  of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the  pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the fermentation properties of galactooligosaccharides synthesised by alpha-galactosidase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == stirred, ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures were used to evaluate the in vitro utilisation by canine gut microflora of novel alpha-galactooligosaccharides synthesised with an enzyme extract from a canine lactobacillus reuteri strain. fructooligosaccharides (fos), melibiose and raffinose were used as reference carbohydrates for the prebiotic properties of the synthesised oligosaccharide (galactosyl melibiose mixture-gmm). addition of lactobacillus acidophilus was used as control for the evaluation of the synbiotic properties of the oligosaccharide with l. reuteri. populations of predominant gut bacterial groups  were monitored over 48 h of batch culture by fluorescent in situ hybridisation, and short-chain fatty acid (scfa) production was measured. gmm showed a higher increase in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli population number and size as well as a higher decrease in clostridia population number and size compared to the commercial prebiotics (fos, melibiose, raffinose). this prebiotic effect was further increased by the addition of l. reuteri followed by a change in the scfa  production pattern compared to gmm alone or gmm with l. acidophilus. the observed change in scfa production was in accordance with the fermentation properties of l. reuteri, suggesting that the novel synbiotic had a significant effect on the canine gut microflora fermentation.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria in milk.
AB  == growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (uht) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. the probiotic strains were lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg,  lactobacillus reuteri sd 2112 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12. fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees c and the samples were analysed for ph, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. the strains reduced ph from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. all strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. the  two lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h  of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. however, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. after 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. all five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. our findings show the importance of controlling the  fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.

TI  == impact of two probiotic lactobacillus strains feeding on fecal lactobacilli and weight gains in chicken.
AB  == two probiotic strains, lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius jcm 1230 isolated from chicken intestine, exhibited probiotic characteristics that can be applied for chicken production. after 7 days of probiotic feeding (fd7), the count of intestinal lactobacilli in the probiotic group (group p, n=10) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in the control  group (group c, n=9). after 40 days of probiotic feeding (fd40), the lactobacilli and enterococci counts were stable but the enterobacteriaceae number was significantly reduced (p<0.05). a total of 163 isolated lactobacilli were identified as the l. acidophilus/gallinarum group (49.7%), l. agilis (30.7%), l.  salivarius (9.2%), l. reuteri (9.2%), and lactobacillus spp. (1.2%). the probiotic lactobacilli positively affected the lactobacillus biota in chickens at fd7, with a significant increase in the number (p<0.05) of l. agilis and group p. the viable counts of each lactobacillus species at fd40, however, showed no differences between two groups. an increasing incidence of l. agilis was also noted with probiotic feeding. the probiotic effect of two strains resulted in significantly increased weight gains (10.7%) of group p in comparison with group  c at fd40 (p<0.01).

TI  == evaluation of the effect of malt, wheat and barley extracts on the viability of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria under acidic conditions.
AB  == in this work, the effect of cereal extracts, used as delivery vehicles for potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab), on the acid tolerance of the cells was evaluated under conditions that simulate the gastric tract. more specifically, the effect of malt, barley and wheat extracts on the viability of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri during exposure for 4 h in a phosphate buffer acidified at ph 2.5 was investigated. in the absence of cereal extracts all strains demonstrated a significant reduction in their cell population, particularly l. plantarum. the viability of l. plantarum was improved by approximately 4 log(10) cycles in the presence of malt and 3 log(10) cycles in the presence of wheat and barley. the survival of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri was increased by more than 1.5 and 0.7  log(10) cycle, respectively, upon addition of cereal extracts. in order to evaluate the contribution of the cereal constituents on cell survival, the individual effect of glucose, maltose and free amino nitrogen (fan), which were added at concentrations that correlated to the reducing sugar and fan content of  the cereal extracts, was examined. the viability of l. plantarum was progressively improved as the maltose or glucose concentration increased; an increase by approximately 2 log(10) cycles was observed in the presence of 8.33 g/l sugar. the survival of l. acidophilus increased by more than 1 log(10) cycle, even at very low concentrations of maltose and glucose (e.g., 0.67 g/l), while l. reuteri stability was enhanced in the presence of maltose but no appreciable effect was demonstrated in the presence of glucose. sugar analysis indicated that glycolysis was inhibited in all cases. addition of tryptone and yeast extract, used as sources of fan, enhanced l. acidophilus acid tolerance, but did not affect l. reuteri and l. plantarum. the results presented in this study indicate  that malt, wheat and barley extracts exhibit a significant protective effect on the viability of l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri under acidic conditions, which could be mainly attributed to the amount of sugar present in the cereal extracts.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16s rdna clone libraries.
AB  == the chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. a strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16s rdna clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. a comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. the 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rdna sequences, 58% of which were classified as low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as proteobacteria. based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. approximately 94% of cloned sequences were  classified into low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to bacteroides  spp., and 2% were classified into proteobacteria. clostridium subcluster xiva (38%), clostridium cluster iv (13%), lactobacillus spp. (24%), and bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in  which the clostridium subcluster xiva was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. the 16s rdna sequences of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. reuteri were the most frequently found in the lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.

TI  == growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

AB  == within the framework of the characterization of the microflora of an industrial sourdough fermentation, strains of lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus pontis and two other strains were isolated which could not be associated with a valid species. these latter strains were gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that could be clearly differentiated from known species by 16s rdna sequence analysis. for further characterization, the morphological, physiological (sugar fermentation, formation of dl-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, growth temperature, co2 production) and chemotaxonomic (g+c content, cell wall composition, sds-page of whole-cell proteins) properties  were determined. fitting of the complete 16s rdna sequence into alignments of such sequences, together with the subsequent phylogenetic calculations, allowed the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. these data showed that the two strains were phylogenetically related but formed an independent cluster distinct from their closest neighbours, l. pontis, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus reuteri. the results of dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated that the two isolates represent a new lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus frumenti is proposed; the type strain of this species is dsm 13145t (= lmg 19473t).

AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

AB  == in an effort to demonstrate the potential usefulness of bacillus subtilis (natto) as a probiotic, we examined the effect of this organism on the growth of three strains of lactobacilli co-cultured aerobically in vitro. addition of b. subtilis (natto) to the culture medium resulted in an increase in the number of viable cells of all lactobacilli tested. since b. subtilis (natto) can produce catalase, which has been reported to exhibit a similar growth-promoting effect on lactobacilli, we also examined the effect of bovine catalase on the growth of lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112 and l. acidophilus jcm 1132. both catalase and b.  subtilis (natto) enhanced the growth of l. reuteri jcm 1112, whereas b. subtilis  (natto) but not catalase enhanced the growth of l. acidophilus jcm 1132. in a medium containing 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide, its toxic effect on l. reuteri jcm 1112 was abolished by catalase or b. subtilis (natto). in addition, a serine protease from b. licheniformis, subtilisin, improved the growth and viability of  l. reuteri jcm 1112 and l. acidophilus jcm 1132 in the absence of hydrogen peroxide. these results indicate that b. subtilis (natto) enhances the growth and (or) viability of lactobacilli, possibly through production of catalase and subtilisin.

AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

AB  == the effect of l. acidophilus supplementation to reduce fecal shedding of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts was compared to l. reuteri using c57bl/6 female mice immunosuppressed by murine leukemia virus (strain lp-bm5) inoculation. after 12 weeks post lp-bm5 inoculation, 15 immunosuppressed mice each were randomly assinged to one of the following treatment groups: historical control (group a),  lp-bm5 control (group b), c. parvum (group c), l. reuteri plus c. parvum (group d) or l. acidophilus plus c. parvum (group e). mice were pre-fed the l. reuteri or l. acidophilus bacteria strains daily for 13 days, challenged with c. parvum oocysts and thereafter fed the specified lactobacillus regimens daily during the  experimental period. animals supplemented with l. reuteri shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on day-7 post c. parvum challenge compared to controls. mice supplemented with l. acidophilus also shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on days 7 and 14 post-challenge compared to controls. overall, lactobacillus supplementation reduced c. parvum shedding in the feces but failed to suppress the production of  t-helper type 2 cytokines [interleukin-4 (il-4), il-8)] which are associated with immunosuppression. additionally, lactobacillus supplementation did not restore t-helper type 1 cytokines (interleukin-2 (il-2) and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), which are required for recovery from parasitic infections. altered t-helper types 1 and 2 cytokine production as a consequence of immunodysfunction permitted the development of persistent cryptosporidiosis while mice with intact immune system  were refractory to infection with c. parvum. reduction in shedding of oocysts observed in the lactobacillus supplemented mice during deminished il-2 and ifn-gamma production may be mediated by factors released into the intestinal lumen by the lactobacillus and possibly other host cellular mechanisms. these observations suggest that l. reuteri or l. acidophilus can reduce c. parvum parasite burdens in the intestinal epithelium during cryptosporidiosis and may serve potential benefits as probiotics for host resistance to intestinal parasitic infections. l. acidophilus was more efficacious in reducing fecal shedding than l. reuteri and therefore may also have implication in the therapy of cryptosporidiosis during immunosuppressive states including human aids.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microbial diversity present in the colonic wall, colonic lumen, and cecal lumen of a pig.
AB  == random clones of 16s ribosomal dna gene sequences were isolated after pcr amplification with eubacterial primers from total genomic dna recovered from samples of the colonic lumen, colonic wall, and cecal lumen from a pig. sequences were also obtained for cultures isolated anaerobically from the same colonic-wall sample. phylogenetic analysis showed that many sequences were related to those of lactobacillus or streptococcus spp. or fell into clusters ix, xiva, and xi of gram-positive bacteria. in addition, 59% of randomly cloned sequences showed less than 95% similarity to database entries or sequences from cultivated organisms. cultivation bias is also suggested by the fact that the majority of isolates (54%) recovered from the colon wall by culturing were related to lactobacillus and streptococcus, whereas this group accounted for only one-third of the sequence variation for the same sample from random cloning. the remaining cultured isolates were mainly selenomonas related. a higher proportion of lactobacillus reuteri-related sequences than of lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus amylovorus-related sequences were present in the colonic-wall sample. since the majority of bacterial ribosomal sequences recovered from the colon wall are less than 95% related to known organisms, the roles of many of the predominant wall-associated bacteria remain to be defined.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  == four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. each bacterial species and candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. the presence of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, or bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with c. albicans alone. the incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. the numbers of c. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by l. casei gg and b. animalis. none of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but b. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to c. albicans. the prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of c. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

AB  == sixteen strains of lactobacillus reuteri and 20 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were tested for resistance to 22 antibiotics by using commercially available sensitivity disks. evidence suggesting linkage of these resistances to  plasmids was obtained by "curing" experiments with acridine dyes and high growth  temperatures. examination of plasmid patterns of agarose gel electrophoresis provided further evidence of loss in plasmid dna under curing conditions in some  of the strains examined.
