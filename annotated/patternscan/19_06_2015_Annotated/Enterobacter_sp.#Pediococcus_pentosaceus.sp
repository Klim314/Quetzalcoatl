TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics of microbial communities during back-slop soaking of soybeans as determined by pcr-dgge and molecular cloning.
AB  == tempe is a traditional fermented food in indonesia. the manufacture process is quite complex, which comprises two stages, preparatory soaking of soybeans and fungal solid state fermentation. daily addition of previous soak water (back-slopping) during the soybean soaking step is considered to be crucial in the manufacture of high quality tempe. the microbial diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities evolving during back-slop soaking of soybeans for tempe making was investigated by culture-independent pcr-dgge and molecular cloning. both dna and total rna were isolated and included in this study, to obtain a view on the succession of total and viable bacteria in the complex microbiota. dgge profiles indicated that enterobacter sp., enterococcus sp., pseudomonas putida, leuconostoc fallax, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella cibaria, were the predominant bacteria. their occurrence shifted dramatically during the back-slop  soaking procedure. this study combined with previous culture-dependent studies could gain a better understanding of the complex microbiota of traditional fermented food and give useful information for its quality control.

TI  == study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in gizan region, saudi arabia.
AB  == traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, bayadh and hamra. the bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and  fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees c. two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. the micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). the content of lactic acid was increased  with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). the ph dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third  fermentations, respectively. the microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lact. lactis subsp. lactis, lact. cellobiosus, klebsiella oxytoca, kl. pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent. sakazakii, serratia marcescens and ser. odourifera), moulds (penicillium sp., rhizopus sp.,  aspergillus niger, alternaria sp., fusarium sp. and mucor sp.) and yeasts (candida parapsilosis, c. orvegnsis and rhodotorula glutinis).

TI  == isolation and characterization of microorganisms associated with the traditional  sorghum fermentation for production of sudanese kisra.
AB  == sorghum flour obtained from sudan was mixed with water in a 1:2 (wt/vol) ratio and fermented at 30 degrees c for 24 h. the bacterial populations increased with  fermentation time and reached a plateau at approximately 18 h. at the end of 24 h, sorghum batter ph had dropped from 5.95 to 3.95 and the batter had a lactic acid content of 0.80%. the microbial population during the 24 h of fermentation consisted of bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus confusus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sp., erwinia ananas, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae), yeasts (candida intermedia and debaryomyces hansenii), and molds (aspergillus sp., penicillium sp., fusarium sp., and rhizopus sp.). p.  pentosaceus was the dominant microorganism at the end of the 24-h fermentation. when three consecutive fermentations using an inoculum from the previous fermentation were carried out, the bacterial population increase plateaued at 9 h. the microbial populations in these fermentations were dominated by p. pentosaceus.
