TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == [management of copd exacerbations: from primary care to hospitalization].
AB  == the societe de pneumologie de langue francaise defines acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae copd) as an increase in daily respiratory symptoms, basically duration >/= 48h or need for treatment adjustment. etiology of ea copd are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae,  or moraxella catarrhalis). pollutant exposure can also lead to ae copd, such as no2, so2, ozone or particulates (pm10 and pm2.5). in 30% the etiology remains unknown. differential diagnoses of ae copd include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. ae copd treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. recommended dose is  0.5 mg/kg on short course (5-7 days). during hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed. the main interest in  non-invasive ventilation is persistent hypercapnia despite optimal medical management. during ambulatory management or hospitalization, clinical assessment  at 48-72 h is mandatory.

TI  == ophthalmic infections in children presenting to angkor hospital for children, siem reap, cambodia.
AB  == background: ophthalmic infections cause significant morbidity in cambodian children but aetiologic data are scarce. we investigated the causes of acute eye  infections in 54 children presenting to the ophthalmology clinic at angkor hospital for children, siem reap between march and october 2012. findings: the median age at presentation was 3.6 years (range 6 days - 16.0 years). forty two patients (77.8%) were classified as having an external eye infection, ten (18.5%) as ophthalmia neonatorum, and two (3.7%) as intra-ocular infection. organisms were identified in all ophthalmia neonatorum patients and 85.7% of patients with  an external eye infection. pathogens were not detected in either of the intra-ocular infection patients. most commonly isolated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13), coliforms (7), haemophilus influenzae/parainfluenzae (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (2). chlamydia trachomatis dna was detected in 60% of swabs taken from ophthalmia neonatorum cases. conclusions: this small study demonstrates the wide range of pathogens associated with common  eye infections in cambodian children. the inclusion of molecular assays improved  the spectrum of detectable pathogens, most notably in neonates.

TI  == [epiglottitis with an abscess caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae.]
AB  == a healthy 23-year-old man was admitted under the diagnosis of acute epiglottitis. flexible fiber laryngoscopic examination showed a swollen epiglottis with an abscess. microbiologic swab showed haemophilus parainfluenzae, non-haemolytic streptococcus and non-haemolytic streptococcus salivarius. only in 1984 a case of acute epiglottitis due to h. parainfluenzae has been described in the literature. still, in this case we think that h. parainfluenzae was the most likely pathogen  causing the abscess.

TI  == clinical characteristics of q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  == background: the clinical characteristics of q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. in southern taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) has never been investigated. methodology/principal findings: during the study period, may 2012 to april 2013, 166 cases of adult cap and 15 cases of acute q fever were prospectively investigated. cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, and q fever (coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with cap. from april 2004 to april 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute q fever were also included retrospectively  for analysis. the geographic distribution of q fever and cap cases was similar. q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than cap. based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver  enzymes were independent characteristics associated with q fever. in patients with q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. twelve (7.2%) cases of cap were seropositive for c. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute q fever. among cap cases, 22.9% had a curb-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), s. pneumoniae (6.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and  klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. moreover, m. pneumoniae, c. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. conclusions: in southern taiwan, q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as  the major presentation and is not a common etiology of cap.

TI  == acute septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae: a rare causative origin.
AB  == septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular (ac) joint is a rare entity with symptoms that include erythema, swelling, and tenderness over the ac joint, fever, and limitation of shoulder motion with pain. in previous reports, staphylococcus and streptococcus species have been mentioned as common causative  organisms. haemophilus parainfluenzae is a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity,  respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract. however, it sometimes causes opportunistic infections leading to septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. ac joint infection associated with h.parainfluenzae is very rare,  and only one case has been reported in the literature. moreover, septic arthritis in immunocompetent patients is also very rare. here, we report the case of a healthy patient with h. parainfluenzae-related septic arthritis of the ac joint.

TI  == polymicrobial endocarditis in intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse.
AB  == infective endocarditis is a life threatening condition with a high mortality rate. intravenous drug abusers (ivda) are more likely to acquire endocarditis. most of the cases of infective endocarditis are caused by a single pathogen; cases of polymicrobial endocarditis are rare and they are associated with a reported mortality rate of more than 30%. only 21 cases of n. sicca endocarditis  have been described in the literature since 1918, and only 15 reported cases of endocarditis which involved actinomyces species have been reported since 1939. we are reporting a case of a 49-year-old male with intravenous heroin and fentanyl abuse, who presented with infective endocarditis caused by neisseria sicca/subflava(n. sicca), actinomyces, streptococcus mitis, and haemophilus parainfluenzae, complicated by septic emboli to the lungs and skin, ards , splenic infarct and immunocomplex mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis.

TI  == purulent pericarditis caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == bacterial pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics. purulent pericarditis is most often caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or haemophilus influenzae. the number of h. parainfluenzae infections has been increasing; in rare cases, it has caused endocarditis. we report a case  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae in a 62-year-old woman who reported a recent upper respiratory tract infection. the patient presented with signs and symptoms of pericardial tamponade. urgent pericardiocentesis restored her hemodynamic stability. however, within 24 hours, fluid reaccumulation led to  recurrent pericardial tamponade and necessitated the creation of a pericardial window. cultures of the first pericardial fluid grew h. parainfluenzae. levofloxacin therapy was started, and the patient recovered. haemophilus parainfluenzae should be considered in a patient who has signs and symptoms of purulent pericarditis. prompt diagnosis, treatment, and antibiotic therapy are necessary for the patient's survival. to our knowledge, this is the first report  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == objective: ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. methods: this is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in hospital universiti sains malaysia from january 2001 to december 2010 were examined. specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on clinical  and laboratory standards institute recommendations. only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. results: a total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas  gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). conclusions:  based on the above results, knowledge of the initial gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. therefore, a  simple gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

AB  == background/purpose: although pre-existing heart disease is the main predisposing  factor for pediatric infective endocarditis (ie), cases of ie in children without underlying heart disease have been increasingly reported. this study reviews the  clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric ie patients with and without underlying heart disease, and presents the unique features of patients with no apparent pre-existing heart disease. methods: children who were admitted to our hospital from january 1991 to april 2011 and met the modified duke criteria for definite or possible ie were retrospectively analyzed. clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected by chart review. results: forty-seven patients with a total of 48 episodes of ie were enrolled. of these patients, 31 children (64.6%) had congenital heart disease (chd), six (12.5%) had non-chd chronic disease, and eleven (22.9%) were previously healthy adolescents. five patients with non-chd chronic conditions acquired infection from central catheter: two methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), two candida albicans and one  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons). the microbial pathogens in 11 previously healthy individuals were streptococcus viridans (n = 3), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa, n = 2), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2), staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), enterococcus (n = 1), and diphtheroid (n  = 1). in total, five of 17 non-chd patients were infected with s. aureus (two mrsa and three mssa) and the vegetations in these five patients were detected in  the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve or right atrium). the average interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ie in the chd and previously  healthy groups was 18 and 31 days, respectively. patients in the previously healthy group were older and more often required surgical interventions for removal of vegetation. conclusion: over one-third (35.4%) of cases of ie in children occurred in patients without pre-existing cardiac disease. early identification of these patients is critical and requires a high index of suspicion. the pathogenesis of ie in previously healthy individuals is still uncertain, but previous skin infection or dental problems may contribute to potential risk.

TI  == summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the united states, 2010: report from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance program.
AB  == the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. in the united states, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). all organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055  (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. the mic(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. all staphylococcus isolates (s. aureus and cons) were inhibited at ceftaroline mic values of </= 2 mug/ml. ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (mic(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; mic(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae). potent activity was also shown against gram-negative pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). furthermore, wild-type strains of enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producing strains and non-ampc-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment  of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to  provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == identification of bacterial dna in noninfectious pleural fluid with a highly sensitive pcr method.
AB  == background: bacterial dna due to bacterial translocation has been identified in noninfectious ascitic fluid samples. objective: this study investigated the possible presence of bacterial dna in the pleural fluid of patients with pleural  effusions of noninfectious origin, using a highly sensitive pcr-based method. methods: pleural fluid samples from 175 patients (average age +/- sd: 69 +/- 14 years) with noninfectious pleural effusion (62 transudates, 113 exudates) were analyzed. bacterial dna was detected using nested pcr with amplification of a fragment of the gene r16s, with 2 amplification protocols, i.e. low sensitivity (10 and 40 cycles) and high sensitivity (40 and 40 cycles). results: with the less sensitive amplification process, only 1 sample was positive (haemophilus parainfluenzae in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax). with the highly sensitive  nested pcr method, bacterial dna was identified in the pleural fluid, of both transudative and exudative origin, of 75 of the 175 patients (43%). in cases of isolation of a single bacterium, the more frequent were escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusions: regardless of its  origin, bacterial dna can be identified in almost half of noninfectious pleural effusions by using a highly sensitive pcr-based method. the possible clinical significance or prognostic value of these findings deserves to be evaluated.

TI  == [the role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  == exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of  life. approximately half of copd exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. current guidelines  recommend antibotic therapy in course of copd exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in copd  exacerbation are haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. the presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. more virulent organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. atypical pathogens such chlamydophila and mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of copd exacerbation has been described in the article.

TI  == acromioclavicular septic arthritis: a case report of a novel pathogen.
AB  == in immunocompetent patients, septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular (ac) joint is a rare entity. it can be difficult to discern from glenohumeral septic arthritis and ac joint impingement syndrome. the usual symptoms are fever, erythema, swelling, palpable pain over the ac joint, and pain with shoulder motion. the most commonly reported causative organism is a staphylococcus or streptococcus species. haemophilus parainfluenzae is a rare cause of septic arthritis in any joint. although limited to case reports in the literature, most  h parainfluenzae skeletal infections occur after surgical intervention. to our knowledge, this is the first case report of ac septic arthritis with h parainfluenzae.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of cem-101 activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including multidrug-resistant pneumococcal serogroup 19a isolates.
AB  == cem-101 is a novel fluorinated macrolide-ketolide with potent activity against bacterial pathogens that are susceptible or resistant to other macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))-ketolide agents. cem-101 is being  developed for oral and parenteral use in moderate to moderately severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. the objective of this study was to assess the activity of cem-101 and comparators against contemporary respiratory tract infection (rti) isolates. a worldwide sample of organisms was used, including streptococcus pneumoniae [n=168; 59.3% erythromycin-resistant and 18 multidrug-resistant (mdr) serogroup 19a strains], moraxella catarrhalis (n=21; 11 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus influenzae (n=100; 48 beta-lactamase positive), haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus haemolyticus (n=12), and legionella pneumophila (n=30). testing and interpretation were performed using reference clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. cem-101 was very potent against s. pneumoniae [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic90)=0.25 mg/l; highest mic at 0.5 mg/l] and was 2- and > or =32-fold more active than telithromycin and clindamycin, respectively. cem-101 also demonstrated potent activity against s. pneumoniae mdr-19a strains (mic90=0.5 mg/l). cem-101 was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested against  l. pneumophila, with all mic values at < or = 0.015 mg/l (telithromycin mic90=0.03 mg/l). cem-101 was as potent as azithromycin against haemophilus spp.  rti pathogens (mic90=2 mg/l), with no variations for beta-lactamase production. cem-101 mic values against m. catarrhalis were all at < or =0.5mg/l. interestingly, cem-101 potency was ca. 6 log(2) dilutions greater than telithromycin mic results among 44 beta-haemolytic streptococci having telithromycin mics > or = 2 mg/l. cem-101 exhibited the greatest potency and widest spectrum of activity against rti pathogens among the tested mls(b)-ketolide agents (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) and was comparable overall with levofloxacin.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == patterns and dynamics of airway colonisation in mechanically-ventilated patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and dynamics of the microbiota in the airways of ventilated patients. seventy-four mechanically-ventilated patients were recruited consecutively, and oropharyngeal, tracheal and bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid specimens were collected 48 h after intubation, and every 72 h thereafter until the patient was extubated or a total  of five sample sets had been collected. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) pathogens were identified, quantified and genotyped. microbial findings were highly correlated both between airway locations and over time when samples were taken no more than 72 h apart. if no vap pathogen was present in the oral flora,  it was unlikely to be found in a lower airway sample; i.e., the positive predictive value of the oropharyngeal sample was 0.73 (95% ci 0.67-0.80), and the negative predictive value was 0.95 (95% ci 0.92-0.99). colonisation with enterobacteriacae, non-fermentative bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was monoclonal in the airways and over time, whereas colonisation with microbes normally found in the oropharynx, i.e., haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, was polyclonal. when antibiotics were used, the chance of recovering vap pathogens from all sampling sites was reduced three-fold. no correlation was observed between a bacterial count of > or =10(4) cfu/ml in bal fluid and chest x-rays compatible with vap.

TI  == [a case of pulmonary abscess in which haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus intermedius were isolated by percutaneous needle aspiration].
AB  == some microbes, including the bacteroides species, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus milleri groups, can cause pulmonary abscess. haemophilus parainfluenzae is usually categorized as one of the normal flora which colonizes  in the ears and the nasopharynx, and it has been long considered that h. parainfluenzae has little pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract and lung parenchymal. in this report, we present a case of pulmonary abscess caused by both h. parainfluenzae and streptococcus intermedius. the patient was a 75-year-old man who had had total esophageo-gastrectomy because of esophageal cancer. he presented with purulent sputum, and chest x-ray film showed a dense consolidation in the right upper lung field. ct-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. since both h. parainfluenzae  and s. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. the patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest x-ray film improved thereafter. so far, very few cases have been reported in which h. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. although s. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that h. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung.

TI  == antibacterial activity of propolis and its active principles alone and in combination with macrolides, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  == propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory  tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. in this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes). we also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.

TI  == [bacterial tracheitis as the cause of acute respiratory insufficiency in 2 teenagers].
AB  == a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy developed acute respiratory insufficiency caused by an upper airway obstruction, which necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. cultures from throat swabs from the girl and boy yielded haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. diagnoses of bacterial tracheitis were confirmed by tracheoscopy and both children were treated with antibiotics. after 11 and 4 days of mechanical ventilation, respectively, they were successfully extubated. no further complications were encountered. bacterial tracheitis is a rare but significant cause of upper airway obstruction in children.

TI  == the sentinel project: an update on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in  community-acquired respiratory streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus spp. in italy.
AB  == a total of 460 streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus spp. collected from respiratory infections during 2000 was tested for their susceptibility to 15 selected antibiotics. overall, penicillin resistance among pneumococci was 10.5%, while lack of susceptibility to macrolides, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol reached 35.2%, 26.2%, 22.6% and 6.0%, respectively. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and levofloxacin were the most potent compounds (100% and 99.9% susceptible strains, respectively). among isolates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae, beta-lactamase production (12.5% and 10%, respectively), and co-trimoxazole (19.9% and 40.0%) and clarithromycin (11.2% and 40.0%) resistance were the prevalent threats. this study confirms the  trend observed in italy since 1992: macrolide resistance among respiratory microorganisms is increasing, while several drugs including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, third generation injectable cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones remain active on the great majority of these pathogens.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe copd with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing  microorganisms in the nasopharyngeal microflora.
AB  == objective: nasopharyngeal microflora contains some beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms. in this study, we investigated in vitro on the indirect pathogenicities of haemophilus parainfluenzae (h. parainfluenzae) and moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis) against the antipneumococcul activities of some beta-lactams. methods: we compared the antimicrobial and bactericidal activities  of beta-lactams against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp) with or without presence of the enzymes of two species of beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms, h. parainfluenzae and m. catarrhalis. results: when adding the enzymes extracted from these two beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms in equivalent amounts of 10(7) cfu/spot,  the minimum inhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin (ampc) and cefaclor (ccl) increased to >64 microg/ml. even third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefditren (cdtr) and ceftriaxone (ctrx) showed marked increases with the enzyme of m. catarrhalis. in time-kill kinetics, same phenomenon was observed in mixed culture indicating the indirect pathogenicities of distinct bacteria, not extracted enzymes, on the cidal activities of beta-lactams against pssp. clavulanic acid (cva)/ampc, faropenem (frpm), and imipenem (ipm) were not affected by these beta-lactamase-producing strains with respect to their activities against pssp. however, these two beta-lactamase-producing strains and  their enzymes did not show any significant influence on the antipneumococcul activities of beta-lactams, until the number of bacterial cells reached >10(8) cfu/ml. conclusion: our results suggest that these two species of beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms in the nasopharyngeal microflora may act  as indirect pathogens on the antipneumococcul activities of beta-lactams with reflecting their substrate profiles, but this is dependent on sufficient amounts  of enzyme for their influence as indirect pathogens.

AB  == garenoxacin (t-3811me, bms-284756) is a novel, broad-spectrum des-f(6) quinolone  currently under study for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. this analysis assessed garenoxacin population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships for safety (adverse effects [ae]) and antimicrobial activity (clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication of streptococcus pneumoniae and the grouping of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus  parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). data were obtained from three phase ii clinical trials of garenoxacin administered orally as 400 mg once daily for 5  to 10 days for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis, and sinusitis. samples were taken from each patient before drug administration, 2 h following administration of the first dose, and on the day 3 to 5 visit. individual bayesian estimates of the fu (fraction unbound), the cmax, and the fu for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fu auc(0-24)) were calculated as measurements of drug exposure by using an ex vivo assessment of average protein binding. regression analysis was performed to  examine the following relationships: treatment-emergent ae incidence and auc(0-24), cmax, or patient factors; clinical response or bacterial eradication and drug exposure (fu cmax/mic, fu auc(0-24)/mic, and other exposure covariates); or disease and patient factors. garenoxacin pharmacokinetics were described by a  one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. clearance was  dependent on creatinine clearance, ideal body weight, age, obesity, and concomitant use of pseudoephedrine. the volume of distribution was dependent on weight and gender. patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction had, on average, approximately a 16 or 26% decrease in clearance, respectively, compared  to patients of the same gender and obesity classification with normal renal function. ae occurrence was not related to garenoxacin exposure. overall, clinical cure and bacterial eradication rates were 91 and 90%, respectively, for  s. pneumoniae and 93 and 92%, respectively, for the grouping of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and m. catarrhalis. the fu auc(0-24)/mic ratios were high (>90% were >200), and none of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic exposure measurements indexed to the mic or other factors were significant predictors of clinical or bacteriologic response. garenoxacin clearance was primarily related to creatinine clearance and ideal body weight. although garenoxacin exposure was approximately  25% higher for patients with moderate renal dysfunction, this increase does not appear to be clinically significant as exposures in this patient population were  not significant predictors of ae occurrence. garenoxacin exposures were at the upper end of the exposure-response curves for measurements of antimicrobial activity, suggesting that 400 mg of garenoxacin once daily is a safe and adequate dose for the treatment of the specified community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of copd exacerbations.
AB  == background: patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. stable copd patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. methods: twenty nine patients with copd (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (sd) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in  1 second (fev(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, fev(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, fev(1)/fvc 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. results: fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), branhamella catarrhalis (20%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). patients colonised by h influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. the median (iqr) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by h influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). the occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with h influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). sputum interleukin (il)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). conclusion: lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of copd exacerbations.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == this paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. in an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good  patient outcome. the guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued  by the american heart association. while most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential  outcome if endocarditis develops. for oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. for gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. for high-risk patients, intramuscular  or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. for moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly enterococcusfaecalis and e. faecium) and the hacek group of organisms (haemophilus parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, actinobacillus [haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae). in general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. a 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. when endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or s. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. for staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. in prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. for all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.

TI  == bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2000: a state-of-the-art review.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the fourth leading cause of death in the united states. the precise role of bacterial infection in the course and pathogenesis of copd has been a source of controversy for decades. chronic bacterial colonization of the lower airways contributes to airway inflammation; more research is needed to test the hypothesis that this bacterial colonization accelerates the progressive decline in lung function seen in copd (the vicious circle hypothesis). the course of copd is characterized by intermittent exacerbations of the disease. studies of samples obtained by bronchoscopy with the protected specimen brush, analysis of the human immune response with appropriate immunoassays, and antibiotic trials reveal that approximately half of exacerbations are caused by bacteria. nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causes of exacerbations, while chlamydia pneumoniae causes a small proportion. the role of  haemophilus parainfluenzae and gram-negative bacilli remains to be established. recent progress in studies of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of infection in the human respiratory tract and in vaccine development guided by such studies promises to lead to novel ways to treat and prevent bacterial infections in copd.

TI  == absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  == following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority  of patients. the objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical  dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. prior  to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. in these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were  identified: streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), haemophilus influenzae (two), and serratia marcescens (one). eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. in three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. in two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of streptococcus viridans and one case of haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. in four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. the authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.

TI  == do bacteria cause exacerbations of copd?
AB  == exacerbations of copd, which include combinations of dyspnea, cough, wheezing, increased sputum production (and a change in its color to green or yellow), are common. the role of bacterial infection in causing these episodes and the value of antibiotic therapy for them are debated. an assessment of the microbiological  studies indicates that conventional bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, are absent in about 50% of attacks. the frequency of isolating these organisms, which often colonize the bronchi of patients in stable condition, does not seem to increase during exacerbations, and their density typically remains unchanged. serologic studies generally fail to show rises in antibody titers to h influenzae; the only report  available demonstrates none to haemophilus parainfluenzae; and the sole investigation of s pneumoniae is inconclusive. trials with vaccines against s pneumoniae and h influenzae show no clear benefit in reducing exacerbations. the  histologic findings of bronchial biopsies and cytologic studies of sputum show predominantly increased eosinophils, rather than neutrophils, contrary to what is expected with bacterial infections. the randomized, placebo-controlled trials generally show no benefit for antibiotics, but most have studied few patients. a  meta-analysis of these demonstrated no clinically significant advantage to antimicrobial therapy. the largest trials suggest that antibiotics confer no advantage for mild episodes; with more severe attacks, in which patients should receive systemic corticosteroids, the addition of antimicrobial therapy is probably not helpful.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

AB  == two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (sapho syndrome) are presented. the diagnoses of diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis at the age of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the sternoclavicular joints with hyperostosis were present, a sapho syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed  coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus, actinomyces and veilonella species at the mandible. repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and  reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed  over a period of up to 20 years. since hla typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of grepafloxacin were compared with clarithromycin in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre clinical trial of 805 patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abecb). patients were randomized to receive grepafloxacin 400 mg od for either 5 (n = 273) or 10 days (n = 268) or clarithromycin 250 mg bd for 10 days (n = 261). patients were assessed pre-treatment, 3-5 days during treatment, 1-3 days post-treatment and at follow-up (21-28 days post-treatment). the clinical success rates for the evaluable patients were 91% in the 5 day grepafloxacin group, 95% in the 10 day grepafloxacin group and 86% in the clarithromycin group. at follow-up, respective rates were 72%, 81% and 73%. a total of 513 pathogens were isolated from the pre-treatment sputum specimens of 400 (49%) patients. the primary pathogens were  haemophilus influenzae (36% of isolates), haemophilus parainfluenzae (27%), moraxella catarrhalis (12%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11%) and staphylococcus aureus (3%). pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated at post-treatment in 85%, 91% and 58% of evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 days,  grepafloxacin 10 days and clarithromycin 10 days, respectively. the eradication rates in both grepafloxacin groups were significantly greater than the clarithromycin group (p<0.001). all treatments were well tolerated and incidence  of drug-related adverse events in each group was comparable. this study demonstrates that both a 5 and a 10 day regimen of grepafloxacin 400 mg od are as clinically and bacteriologically effective as in the treatment of abecb clarithromycin 250 mg bd. for 10 days.

TI  == management of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in chronic bronchitis, a common respiratory illness marked by chronic productive  cough and caused largely by cigarette smoking, bacterial exacerbations are thought to be a common cause of progressive airway damage. common bacterial pathogens, found in 50% to 60% of episodes, include haemophilus influenzae (the most common), as well as haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. bacterial resistance to antibiotics, especially beta-lactam drugs such as amoxicillin, is increasingly common in these pathogens. in this illness, clinical risk stratification based on age, history and comorbidity is an important strategy. patients in the lowest risk group likely have viral infections and require no specific treatment. patients in the higher risk groups require aggressive treatment to avoid treatment failure, which can lead to prolonged hospitalization and complications. preventive therapies (smoking cessation and influenza vaccination) are worthwhile measures for these patients.

AB  == three hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled in a double-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the clinical and bacteriologic efficacies and safety of a 5-day course (n = 195) versus a 10-day course (n = 194) of grepafloxacin 400 mg once daily in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abecb). patients in the 5-day treatment group received placebo on days 6 through 10. bacteriologic assessments were based on cultures of sputum specimens obtained before and, when possible, during and after treatment.  organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 332 of 388 (86%) patients, the primary pathogens being haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus (29%, 19%, 4%, 5%, and 5% of isolates, respectively). among isolates tested for beta-lactamase production, results were positive in 25% of h  influenzae isolates and 90% of m catarrhalis isolates. forty-two percent of s pneumoniae isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility (intermediate or high-level resistance) to penicillin. a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 83% (128 of 155) and 81% (122 of 150) of clinically  evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5 or 10 days, respectively. pathogens were eradicated or presumed eradicated in 77% (106 of 138) and 80% (98  of 123) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with grepafloxacin for 5  or 10 days, respectively. the 2 treatment groups were equivalent with respect to  both clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, and no statistically significant differences in the incidence of drug-related adverse events were seen between the 2 groups. substantial symptom relief was evident with both treatment regimens by  the first during-treatment measurement, which occurred between days 3 through 5.  these results indicate that treatment with 400 mg grepafloxacin once daily for 5  days is as well tolerated and effective as treatment for 10 days in patients with abecb. the lower cost compared with a 10-day regimen and the increased likelihood that patients will complete the entire shorter, once-daily regimen make the 5-day grepafloxacin regimen a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of abecb.

AB  == although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) appears beneficial in patients with a  history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. in a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (cip) 750 mg and clarithromycin (cla) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with aecb  (1083 cip, 1097 cla). patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe aecb episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for aecb within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. the majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). mean patient age was 62 years. a history of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of cip-treated patients and 53% of cla-treated patients. of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species, 28%; moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; enterobacteriaceae, 18%; staphylococcus aureus, 17%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of haemophilus influenzae, 10% of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of m catarrhalis isolates. thirty-four percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/l). among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for cip versus 90% and 96% for cla. the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance. superinfections were  reported significantly more frequently in cla-treated (3%) versus cip-treated patients (1%). eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla, respectively, were haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; m catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; s pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of cip-treated patients and 10% of cla-treated patients. cip 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe aecb. the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == twenty one cases of infective endocarditis in last 10 years were re-evaluated by  duke's criteria. fourteen strains of streptococcus viridans, 4 of enterococcus faecalis, 1 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were isolated from blood culture. as to the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 8 strains of streptococci, imipenem revealed the lowest mic value, following penicillin g, ceftriaxon not equal to ampicillin, vancomycin and gentamicin. one strain of them was penicillin-resistant (0.8 micrograms/ml). serum inhibitory test (sit) and serum bactericidal test (sbt) were undergone for 6 cases. the assay was efficient to determine penicillin-tolerance of causative bacterium. vegetations were observed  in 18 cases of 21 by the echo-cardiography, especially transesophageal echocardiography had better diagnostic sensitivity compared to transthoracic echocardiography. however, it took 12 weeks from the first febrile episode to achieve definite diagnosis. one of reasons to take such a long time to reach diagnosis was that major causative organism was s. sanguis, whose inflammatory reaction to the host was said to be strikingly weak.

TI  == [epidemiology of acute bronchopulmonary infections in children].
AB  == in infants and young children acute lower respiratory infection is the most common cause of morbidity and death especially in developing countries. factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens include  young age, season, sex, indoor pollution, large family size, malnutrition, low immunocompetence, socioeconomic disadvantage. the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in childhood seems similar worldwide. in all countries, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzae virus 1 and 3 influenzae a and b viruses and adenovirus are reported to be the main causes of acute respiratory infections. six microorganisms are responsible of 90% of documented acute bacterial pulmonary infections, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae,  chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus. mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently (30%). the  role of respiratory viruses in predisposing to colonization and invasion of bacterial organisms has often been suggested. in recent years acquired resistance against antibiotic for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae has emerged.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many grampositive species. in this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods described in the national committe for clinical laboratory standards. the greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, legionella spp., lactobacillus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). marginal activity (mic90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and streptococcus bovis. against haemophilus parainfluenzae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved  for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/ml) were evaluated. acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and legionella spp. these results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.

AB  == two independent, investigator-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trials compared the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of two oral antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate, in the treatment of patients with secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis (hereafter denoted acute bronchitis). three hundred sixty patients with signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis were enrolled at 22 centers and were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with either cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (bid) (n= 177) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg three times daily (tid) (n = 183). patients were assessed for both clinical and bacteriologic responses once during treatment (at 3 to 5 days) and twice after treatment (at 1 to 3 days and at 13 to 15 days). bacteriologic assessments were based on sputum specimen cultures obtained before treatment and, when possible, after treatment. organisms were isolated from the pretreatment sputum specimens of 162 (45%) of 360 patients, with the primary pathogens being haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus (28%, 25%, 11%, 9%, and 8% of isolates, respectively). thirty-four percent of the h influenzae isolates and 94% of the m catarrhalis isolates that were tested for beta-lactamase production were positive. a satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 86% (117 of 136) and 83% (130 of 157) of the clinically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (p = 0.45). with respect to the eradication of bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure,  presumed care, or cure with colonization) was obtained in 91% (53 of 58) and 86%  (60 of 70) of bacteriologically assessable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively (p = 0.32). treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate was associated with a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse events than was treatment with cefuroxime axetil (39% vs 23%; p = 0.001), primarily reflecting a higher incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events (37% vs 15%; p < 0.001), particularly diarrhea and nausea. four patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and eight patients in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group withdrew from the study because of drug-related adverse events. these results indicate that cefuroxime axetil 250 mg bid is as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg tid in the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis but produces fewer gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == multicenter trial of cefpodoxime proxetil vs. amoxicillin-clavulanate in acute lower respiratory tract infections in childhood. international study group.
AB  == acute lower respiratory tract infections in children are a worldwide public health problem, with an estimated 4 million potentially preventable deaths every  year. until recently, penicillin and related drugs were the treatment of choice for empiric therapy of paediatric lower respiratory tract infections. however, concerns over the emergence of penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis have led physicians to turn increasingly towards alternatives, such as the third generation cephalosporins. the oral extended spectrum cephalosporin cefpodoxime proxetil is highly active against the bacterial pathogens commonly associated with childhood lower respiratory tract infections. in order to evaluate its clinical efficacy in children with acute febrile lower respiratory tract infections, an international, multicenter, comparative, randomized open study was conducted in children ages 3 months to 11.5 years. of 348 cases enrolled, 234 were randomized to cefpodoxime proxetil (8 mg/kg/day twice daily) and 114 to amoxicilin/clavanulate (amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day 3 times a day). the duration of treatment was 10 days. pretreatment diagnosis was pneumonia in 292 patients, bronchiolitis in 19 patients and acute bronchitis in 37 patients. pathogens isolated from 59 cases included h. influenzae (47.5%), s. pneumoniae (23.7%), m. catarrhalis (11.9%) and haemophilus parainfluenzae (6.8%). clinical efficacy was evaluable in 278 children at the end of treatment when 95.2% of patients in the cefpodoxime proxetil group and 96.7% of patients in the amoxicillin/clavanulate group showed a satisfactory clinical response (cured or improved). the improvement was sustained at the follow-up visit, 10 to 20 days after completion of treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == head and neck space infections in infants and children.
AB  == a retrospective study was performed in 117 children with head and neck space infections treated at the children's hospital of pittsburgh from january 1986 through june 1992. peritonsillar space infections were the most common (49%), followed by retropharyngeal (22%), submandibular (14%), buccal (11%), parapharyngeal (2%), and canine (2%) space infections. the most common pathogens  isolated (n = 78) were the aerobes beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18%) and staphylococcus aureus (18%), the anaerobes bacteroides melaninogenicus (17%) and  veillonella (14%), and the gram-negative organism haemophilus parainfluenzae (14%). beta-lactamase production by aerobic pathogens was detected in 22% of cultures. computed tomography scans (n = 16) were reviewed in blinded fashion and compared with operative findings. the sensitivity of computed tomography scan in  detecting the presence of an abscess vs. cellulitis was high (91%), whereas the specificity was rather low (60%). treatment of head and neck space infections in  children should consist of accurate physical diagnosis aided by imaging studies,  empiric antibiotic therapy that covers gram-negative and beta-lactamase--producing organisms as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes, and timely surgical intervention, when indicated.

TI  == [balanitis and infectious agents. a prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

TI  == binding of human high-molecular-weight salivary mucins (mg1) to hemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == in human saliva, two different mucin populations can be distinguished, viz., high-molecular-weight mucins (mg1, mol. wt > 1 x 10(6)) and low-molecular-weight  mucins (mg2, mol. wt approximately 125 kd). the carbohydrate moiety of mg1 displays a wide spectrum of oligosaccharide structures, varying in composition, length, branching, and acidity. the biological significance of the heterogeneity  in carbohydrate structures of mucins is unclear. the present investigation focused on the question whether mg1, because of its diverse carbohydrate side-chain population, can bind to a large variety of oral micro-organisms. a replica plate technique, in combination with immunochemical detection with monoclonal antibodies against mg1, was used to screen in vivo human oral microflora for the presence of micro-organisms which could bind the high-molecular-weight salivary mucin mg1. binding to purified mg1 was established for hemophilus (para)influenzae species, whereas other species, including streptococcus and staphylococcus, were negative. mg1 binding to hemophilus parainfluenzae could be abolished by protease treatment of mg1. in contrast, periodate acid treatment, partial deglycosylation, or addition of monosaccharides did not affect mg1 binding to h. parainfluenzae, indicating that mg1 carbohydrate side-chains were not directly involved in the binding. the binding was ph-dependent, showing an increase when the ph was lowered from 8.0 to 4.0. these  data indicate that mg1 can be bound in a selective manner by hemophilus spp. and  suggest that the 'naked' unglycosylated polypeptide moiety of mg1 is involved in  its binding to hemophilus parainfluenzae.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

TI  == optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == a total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, macconkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 u of polymyxin b per ml and 2 u of bacitracin per ml (of-pbl medium) for pseudomonas cepacia. with two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. the two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. in addition, the results of this  study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. in rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, candida albicans, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae,  molds, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, p. cepacia, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == microbiological considerations of the etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == one hundred eight-four sputum specimens from the same number of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship between the microorganisms isolated and the presumptive pathology. the sputa were subdivided into three groups; "high probability", "low  probability", and "contaminated sputa", following the criteria of the microscopic readings: sputum with more than 25 white cells and low numbers of squamous epithelial cells represents true lower respiratory tract infections (high probability); those with fewer than 25 white cells represent non-bacterial infections or non-infected sputa (low probability) while sputa with more than 25  squamous cells per field represent contaminated specimens (contaminated sputa). statistical analysis was carried out to correlate these data. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes showed significant differences in the three groups considered.

TI  == double-blind randomized study comparing the efficacies and safeties of a short (3-day) course of azithromycin and a 5-day course of amoxicillin in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == the efficacies and safeties of a three-dose regimen of azithromycin (500 mg once  daily for 3 days) and a 15-dose regimen of amoxicillin (500 mg three times daily  for 5 days) were compared in a double-blind manner in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. a total of 92% of patients suffered a type 1  exacerbation. treatment success, defined as cure or major improvement, was achieved in all patients in the azithromycin group by day 5, compared with 23 (92%) of 25 patients in the amoxicillin group. on day 12, these data were 24 of 25 (96%) in the azithromycin group and 20 of 25 (80%) in the amoxicillin group (results were not significantly different). several pathogens were isolated (mic  ranges [micrograms per milliliter] in parentheses): haemophilus influenzae or haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated 23 times (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 32; amoxicillin, 0.12 to 2); streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 11 patients (azithromcyin, less than or equal to 0.06 greater than  256; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25); moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis was isolated from eight patients (azithromycin, less than or equal to 0.06; amoxicillin, less than or equal to 0.06 to 16); and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from eight patients. one patient treated  with azithromycin had legionella pneumophila pneumonia, and another in that group had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza a virus. one patient treated with amoxicillin also had a significant rise in titer of antibody against influenza a virus. microbiological response rates were comparable. one patient who received azithromycin developed abnormal liver function. two patients treated with amoxicillin developed abnormal liver functions, one developed exanthema, and one treatment was stopped because of nausea. it is concluded that  a three-dose (3-day) regimen of azithromycin is as effective clinically and microbiologically as a 15-dose (5-day) regimen of amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

AB  == cefixime, a new orally absorbed iminomethoxyaminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was tested against some microorganisms involved in upper and lower respiratory tract  infections such as haemophilus (influenzae and parainfluenzae), moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated in the period from november 1990 to april 1991. its activity was compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ofloxacin. cefixime inhibits 90% of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, both beta-lactamase producers (blp) or not (nblp) at concentrations of less than 0.25 mg/l. it inhibits 90% of m. catarrhalis (blp and nblp) at concentrations of less than 1 mg/l. in general, cefixime has a superior in vitro activity with respect to cefaclor and the other cephalosporins as well as erythromycin and amoxicillin (the last one in blp strains). in the evaluation of the antibacterial activity of beta-lactam against haemophilus and m. catarrhalis, the authors observed different indications in the guidelines for ampicillin. cefixime is not destroyed by the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase produced by haemophilus sp. and m. catarrhalis (tem and rob in haemophilus strains and bro in m. catarrhalis). in view of its excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory tract pathogens, cefixime is indicated in the therapy of these infections.

TI  == changes in the spectrum of organisms causing respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  == over the last decade, the spectrum of organisms causing community-acquired acute  lower respiratory tract infections has changed. streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of haemophilus influenzae other than type b, h. parainfluenzae  and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. chlamydia pneumoniae is  a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. in 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by gram-negative bacilli and s. aureus. these organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  == effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abe)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. the pathologic and  physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with  abe, although these symptoms are not unique to abe. while culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. bacteria in numbers significantly  above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. bacterial species observed with abe include haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of klebsiella and pseudomonas species. one or more elements of background therapy for abe should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for abe. quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.

AB  == on hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in toulouse, france, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. the following incidences were found: neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and trichomonas vaginalis: 4  (1.8%). the prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. no pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation  to clinical findings. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (p less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (pmn/hpf) (p less than .001). g. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (p less than .05) and in men with less than five pmn/hpf (p less than .05). isolation of c. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (p less than .05) and balanitis (p less than .001). like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. in contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates  in the management of urethritis in men.

TI  == comparative study of clarithromycin and roxithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the efficacy and tolerance of clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily) were compared with those of roxithromycin (150 mg twice daily) in an open, multicentre trial of 77 inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia. sixty-five patients were clinically evaluable (34, clarithromycin; 31 roxithromycin). efficacy was comparable between treatment groups: 26 of 34 patients (76%) treated with clarithromycin were clinically cured, including four with atypical pneumonia. in  the roxithromycin group 25 of 31 patients (81%) were clinically cured and one was improved. cough, appearance of sputum, and fever improved in most patients in both treatment groups. chest x-rays after treatment showed resolution or improvement in 76% of patients who received clarithromycin and 87% of those who received roxithromycin. the clinical evaluation of the response generally agreed  with the bacteriological response. among patients who were bacteriologically evaluable for four target organisms (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis) the pathogen was eradicated in four of seven (57%) in the clarithromycin-treated group and in five of six (83%) in the roxithromycin-treated group. adverse events were reported in  more patients who received roxithromycin (21.6%) than in those who received clarithromycin (12.5%) although the incidences were not statistically significantly different. the majority of adverse events were transient increases  in serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. clarithromycin was shown to be effective and well-tolerated; the clinical efficacy and safety of clarithromycin and roxithromycin were comparable.

TI  == purification and characterization of an outer membrane protein adhesin from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28.
AB  == outer membranes were isolated from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28 by a mild extraction method followed by sephadex g-150 gel filtration chromatography. the first peak (pool 1) recovered contained an activity which inhibited adherence of  hp-28 cells to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of pool 1 revealed a dominant protein band of 34 kda. the sds-page-purified 34-kda protein was excised from the gel and used for antibody preparation in rabbits. the antiserum produced was analyzed by immunoblot and was shown to be monospecific for the 34-kda protein. anti-34-kda protein antibody was purified from the rabbit antiserum by protein a-sepharose 6mb affinity chromatography. this antibody was then cross-linked to protein a-sepharose 6mb to construct a second affinity column. the 34-kda proteins were purified from outer membranes by this affinity chromatography. the 34-kda protein was homogeneous, as confirmed by sds-page, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase chromatography analyses. fab and fc fragments of the purified anti-34-kda protein antibodies were prepared by papain  digestion, followed by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. fab fragments from the anti-34-kda protein antibody and the affinity-purified 34-kda protein both showed significant inhibition of parent h. parainfluenzae hp-28 cell adherence to experimental salivary pellicle and to streptococcus sanguis sa-1.

TI  == introduction of transposon tn916 dna into haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus  parainfluenzae.
AB  == enterococcus (streptococcus) faecalis transposon tn916 was introduced into haemophilus influenzae rd and haemophilus parainfluenzae by transformation and demonstrated to transpose efficiently. haemophilus transformants resistant to tetracycline were observed at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(3)/micrograms of either pam120 (pgl101::tn916) or pam180 (pam81::tn916) plasmid dnas, which are incapable of autonomous replication in this host. restriction enzyme analysis and southern blot hybridization revealed that (i) tn916 integrates into many different sites in the h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae genomes; (ii) only the 16.4-kilobase-pair tn916 dna integrates, and no vector dna was detected; and (iii) the tetr phenotype was stable in the absence of selective pressure. second-generation tn916 transformants occurred at  the high frequency of chromosomal markers and retained their original chromosomal locations. similar results were obtained with h. influenzae rd bc200 rec-1 as the recipient strain, which suggests host rec functions are not required in tn916 integrative transposition. transposition with tn916 is an important procedure for mutagenesis of haemophilus species.

TI  == pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  zimbabwe, central africa.
AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

TI  == histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  == five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--branhamella  catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. bacterial species commonly isolated from infected  sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--enterobacteriacae, neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and candida albicans--were similarly studied. of the "pathogens", the gram negative species b catarrhalis, h parainfluenzae and ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for  the gram positive species s aureus and s pneumoniae. of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. these results show that some gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.

TI  == utilization of a continuous streptococcal surface to measure interbacterial adherence in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cell-to-cell interactions are essential for the formation of dental plaque. a continuous layer of streptococcus sanguis sa-1 cells fixed to a solid surface has been used to evaluate interactions among this bacterium, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and streptococcus sobrinus. s. sanguis cells were attached to a falcon 3001 tissue culture plates or bovine enamel chips, coated with a biological adhesive. scanning electron microscopy of the chips showed the streptococci as a contiguous surface. radiolabeled bacteria were used to measure  a second-species interbacterial adherence to the streptococcal-coated culture plates. strains of h. parainfluenzae known to coaggregate (strain hp-28) and not  to coaggregate (strains hp-42 and hp-80), in suspension with s. sanguis strain sa-1, were studied for adherence. ten-fold-higher numbers of coaggregating strain hp-28 adhered in vitro to the streptococcal layer than did the non-coaggregating  strains. s. sobrinus strain 6715 did not show appreciable adherence to the s. sanguis surface. saliva did not affect the adherence of coaggregating or non-coaggregating h. parainfluenzae strains to s. sanguis strain sa-1. bovine enamel chips, coated with streptococci, mounted on modified orthodontic appliances and placed in the mouths of three volunteers, facilitated the measurement of interbacterial adherence in vivo of streptomycin-resistant strains of h. parainfluenzae (hp-28r or hp-42r). suspensions of bacteria were placed into the mouth, distributed throughout, and expectorated. after 15 or 120 minutes, the appliance with the chips was removed, the chips sonified, and colony-forming units (cfu) of streptomycin-resistant haemophili determined per chip.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == dna probe technology for rapid detection of haemophilus influenzae in clinical specimens.
AB  == in a previous study, we reported that a 5-kilobase haemophilus influenzae dna fragment involved in penicillin-binding protein expression could be used as a probe for specific detection of h. influenzae strains (f. malouin and l. e. bryan, mol. cell. probes 1:221-232, 1987). here, we report the ability of this probe to detect h. influenzae in clinical specimens. in a bacterial dot experiment, there was strong hybridization of the 32p-labeled probe to nonencapsulated and serotype a through f h. influenzae strains. the detection of  h. influenzae in body fluids was then evaluated by using pooled human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sputum as dilution media for h. influenzae, haemophilus aegyptius, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and escherichia coli cells. at 65 degrees c, the probe hybridized to h. influenzae and h. aegyptius (greater than or equal to 10(5) cells) in all fluids. there was no hybridization with the  e. coli negative control, and h. parainfluenzae hybridized when greater than or equal to 10(7) cells were used. experiments performed at 73 and 80 degrees c permitted elimination of h. parainfluenzae hybridization. the detection of h. influenzae in 232 sputa from patients with respiratory tract infections was very  specific (96 to 97%) and sensitive (74 to 100%) when the total time of the procedure was sufficient (6 to 24 h) and when the experiments were performed at 80 degrees c. in addition, the probe detected three of three and four of four h.  influenzae-infected cerebrospinal fluids and blood cultures, respectively, and did not react with pneumococcus- or streptococcus-infected cerebrospinal fluids.  finally, by using a small-scale procedure, the probe rapidly detected h. influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid and sputum specimens (4 and 8 h, respectively). these results imply prompt diagnosis of h. influenzae infections caused by nonencapsulated and serotype a through f strains.

AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern netherlands.
AB  == results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. no explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by b. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.

TI  == nitrate- and nitrite-reducing bacteria in the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == the microbial composition of samples of gastric juice from eight achlorhydric patients was determined by aerobic and rigorously anaerobic culture techniques. bacteria from 16 genera were commonly isolated, but representatives of only three genera, (streptococci, neisseriae and haemophili) were isolated from every patient. nitrate and nitrite were both reduced by veillonellae, haemophili, staphylococci, corynebacteria, lactobacilli, flavobacteria and fusobacteria, but  the potential rate of nitrate reduction by suspensions of veillonellae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and members of the enterobacteriaceae were up to ten times more rapid than the rate of nitrite reduction. conversely, although all neisseria spp. reduced nitrite only some strains reduced nitrate. streptococci did not reduce nitrate. streptococcus sanguis reduced nitrite when grown with haematin; other streptococci did not reduce nitrite. bacterial nitrate and nitrite reduction were active over the ph range 6-8, similar to the ph range of the achlorhydric stomach. from a knowledge of the composition of the bacterial flora and their potential rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction under prevailing conditions, predictions were made about the tendency of nitrite to accumulate during nitrate reduction. studies of the transient accumulation of nitrite by mixed cultures of h. parainfluenzae and n. subflava were consistent with these predictions. haemophili and veillonellae could be responsible for the accumulation of nitrite in the gastric juice of some patients, whereas streptococci and neisseriae would tend to remove nitrite from the stomach as rapidly as it formed.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  == eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). the groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated  with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. in the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five streptococcus pneumoniae, five neisseria meningitidis, one klebsiella pneumoniae, one pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one listeria. in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 h. influenzae isolates, 10 s. pneumoniae, three n. meningitidis, one haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one citrobacter. of 63 patients with assessable csf pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (s. pneumoniae)  and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, h. influenzae; three, s. pneumoniae; and one, citrobacter). twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. no clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.

TI  == josamycin: interpretation of inhibition zones with the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion test as compared with erythromycin.
AB  == a total of 432 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (128), coagulase-negative staphylococci (123), group a and b beta-hemolytic streptococci (61), group d streptococci (30), streptococcus penumoniae (29), haemophilus influenzae (19), haemophilus parainfluenzae (12), and legionella pneumophila (30) were examined with the agar dilution and bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion tests for susceptibility to josamycin as compared with erythromycin. on a weight-for-weight basis, erythromycin was more active than josamycin against all  bacterial species, including l. pneumophila. josamycin inhibited 18 of 23 s. aureus and 11 of 16 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains resistant to erythromycin. utilizing minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) breakpoints of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml (sensitive), 4 microgram/ml (intermediate)  and of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (resistant), and inhibition zone  criteria of greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter (sensitive), 14-17 mm (intermediate), and less than or equal to 13 mm (resistant), and excluding l. pneumophila, there was good correlation between erythromycin mic and corresponding disk diffusion data for staphylococci and streptococci, but not for haemophilus species. in comparison, josamycin yielded a significant number of minor discrepant data for group d streptococci and haemophilus species. it is suggested that erythromycin and josamycin should not be tested against haemophilus species, and that josamycin should be excluded from test batteries against enterococci. erythromycin-resistant staphylococci require separate testing with josamycin.

TI  == potential significance of colonization with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus  parainfluenzae in children.
AB  == recent surveys in vancouver showed most healthy children were colonized with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae. such organisms might alter the effects of penicillins on throat bacteria by local inactivation. to test this hypothesis in vitro, three isolates of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae were each mixed on a membrane with ampicillin-sensitive strains of haemophilus influenzae type b or group a streptococcus pyogenes and exposed to ampicillin. when tested alone, susceptible strains were rapidly killed but when tested together with a beta-lactamase producer, they were protected, indicating efficient ampicillin degradation by haemophilus parainfluenzae strains. if similar interactions occur in vivo, the effects of beta-lactams on throat bacteria could be significantly altered in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae.

(including 6 b. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 fusobacterium sp. there were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of s. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of b. melaninogenicus. the presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. in the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == a simple biological method for detecting streptococcal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase.
AB  == a biological method for detecting streptococcal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (nadg) is presented, based on its ability to inhibit the growth of haemophilus parainfluenzae. three hundred clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci were tested. all isolates producing nadg belonged to lancefield's group a, c, or g.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.

TI  == interactions between viruses and bacteria in patients with chronic bronchitis.
AB  == the possibility that viral infections of the respiratory tract might predispose to bacterial colonization or infection was studied in 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 30 control subjects; these individuals were observed for seven years. the ratio of the number of observed to the number of expected associations between viruses and bacteria was 2.43 (p = 0.037) for the pair influenza virus and streptococcus pneumoniae and was 2.06 (p = 0.056) for influenza virus and haemophilus influenzae. consistently positive, but not significant, associations were detected between rhinovirus and herpes simplex virus infections and isolations of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. in contrast,  isolations of the nonpathogenic haemophilus parainfluenzae could not be related to prior viral infections. significant rises in titer of antibody to h. influenzae were detected on 76 occasions, and 20 (26%) of these antibody rises were associated with viral or mycoplasmal infections during the preceding 120 days. the expected number of such associations was 8.34 (ratio of number observed to number expected, 2.40; p = 0.08). these results suggest that viral infections  of the respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with increased colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and may also predispose to infections with h. influenzae.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

TI  == haemophili in developing dental plaque.
AB  == evidence for a possible role played by oral haemophili in the development of dental plaque was sought by studying the occurrence of these bacteria in early dental plaque of smooth surfaces and occlusal fissures in six dental students. the mean number of haemophili per 10(3) anaerobes in early smooth surface plaque  (18 h) and fissure plaque (7 d) was 95 and 22 respectively. examination of 988 haemophilus isolates revealed that h. parainfluenzae was the only species in samples of fissure plaque, whereas some samples from smooth surfaces, in addition to the predominating and ubiquitous h. parainfluenzae, yielded growth of the two  species h. segnis and h. aphrophilus. it is concluded that haemophili are among the primary colonizers of smooth surfaces of teeth.

TI  == bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic haemophilus in the throat.
AB  == hemolytic haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. on rabbit blood-agar they grow well  and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added x and v factors. a survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. from 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in  8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; candida and neisseria in 2 sore throats each. all of the 33 hemolytic haemophilus isolates identified to species were h. parahaemolyticus. all were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by gram  stain morphology, but h. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. h. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.
