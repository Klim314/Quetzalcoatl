TI  == activities of hmr 3004 (ru 64004) and hmr 3647 (ru 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite  pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == [bite wound infections: study of 22 hospitalized patients].
AB  == background: to study the characteristics of bite wounds with unfavorable evolution, developing infectious complications that requires hospital admission.  methods: the data from 22 patients admitted to the ciudad sanitaria vall d'hebron hospital for the above mentioned reason over the last 5 years were reviewed. results: the patients (8 males, 8 females and 6 children) were bitten by 10 dogs, 6 cats, and 6 men with predominance of the wound site being in the upper limb (10) followed by the lower limbs (6), head or face (5) and exceptionally on the breast (1). the most frequent clinical manifestation was abscess and/or cellulitis (13) and adenopathies or lymphangitis (4); 5 patients presented osteoarticular involvement including 3 bone fractures due to human aggression. with regard to the etiology of infection, the common bucal flora bacteria were isolated in all the cases; pasteurella multocida in 15/16 animal bites, eikenella corrodens associated to streptococcus in 5/6 human bites, fusobacterium spp. (5), bacteroides spp. (3) and peptococcus sp. (1). the most frequently administered antibiotics were gentamycin (15), penicillin (13), cloxacillin (5) and clindamycin (4). the evolution was favorable, although slow in many cases, with sequelae in 3 patients. conclusions: it is very difficult to foresee in which cases infectious complications will develop in bite wounds. according to the authors' experience, in the case of deep wounds the bacteria implied come from the mouth of the aggressor. careful cleansing, rapid administration of an adequate antibiotic and clinical control being the most recommendable procedure.

TI  == dog-associated bacterial infections in humans: isolates submitted to an australian reference laboratory, 1981-1992.
AB  == over the period 1981-92, 32 bacterial isolates were referred to the microbiological diagnostic unit from infected dog-bite wounds and 10 isolates were submitted from blood cultures after dog bites or close contact with dogs. the isolates from the bite wounds were identified, or confirmed, as pasteurella multocida (11 isolates), pasteurella dagmatis (3), cdc group m-5 (9), cdc group ef-4a (8) and streptococcus anginosus (1). five of the 9 patients from whom cdc group m-5 was cultured had mixed infections: 2 with p. multocida one of which also had bacteroides sp., one with p. dagmatis, one with cdc group ef-4a and another with bacteroides sp. nine of the 10 blood isolates were identified as capnocytophaga canimorsus. the remaining one of streptobacillus moniliformis, which is typically associated with rat-bite fever, was the result of a bite from  a breed of dog (greyhound) that eats rodents. clinical notes are provided for infections caused by the more unusual bacterial isolates and their laboratory identification is described.

TI  == [phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  == the authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. a complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom :  pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces sp., bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a gram- bacteria related to group ii j. the pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on  the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand  on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. this kind  of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a  preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
