TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus bipolaris tetramera.
AB  == background: particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf934408 from rhizospheric soil. this  phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. results: silver (agnps) and gold nanoparticles (aunps) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron  microscopic analysis. the formulated agnps were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas aunps were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. the nanoparticles were assessed  for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j774 and thp1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were  non-toxic at both low and high doses. furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ros was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. conclusion: in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.

TI  == functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the south china sea.
AB  == phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. in this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different  marine sponge species in the south china sea using five different culture media.  eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and  grouped into 13 genera, including actinoalloteichus, kocuria, micrococcus, micromonospora, mycobacterium, nocardiopsis, prauserella, rhodococcus, saccharopolyspora, salinispora, serinicoccus, and streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene. based on the screening of phze genes, ten strains, including five streptomyces, two nocardiopsis, one salinispora, one micrococcus, and one serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. the level of phze gene expression was highly expressed in nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on esi-ms and nmr analysis. the compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against bacillus mycoides sj14, staphylococcus aureus sj51, escherichia coli sj42, and micrococcus luteus sj47. this study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.

TI  == [specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra oaxaca, mexico].
AB  == specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra  oaxaca, mexico. bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. they have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. to contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota  and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial  diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. for this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from february to october 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees  c. bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and  biochemical tests. we obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. we found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum proteobacteria and the family enterobacteriaceae. statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. it was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with bacillus cereus, b. sp. x. sp., as well as, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. these bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. by understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.

TI  == the blow fly, chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in northeast thailand.
AB  == the oriental latrine fly, chrysomya megacephala (fabricius) (diptera: calliphoridae) and the house fly, musca domestica l., (diptera: muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. there were two main aims of this study. the first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and  paddy fields, in the muang ubon ratchathani and warinchamrap districts of ubon ratchathani province of northeast thailand. flies collection were conducted monthly from september 2010-october 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. a total of 7 750 flies (6 401 c. megacephala and 1 349 m.domestica) were collected. the second aim was to examine  the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 c. megacephala and 439 m. domestica). a total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive  bacteria. the most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by streptococcus group d non-enterococci. human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were salmonella sp.,  shigella sp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, bacillus sp., and enterococcus sp., of which s. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. other human pathogens included staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. not only were the number of c. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for m. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than m. domestica. these data suggest that both fly  species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens  associated with human habitations year-round in this region of northeast thailand.

TI  == undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors: antibacterial drug leads.
AB  == there is a significant need for new antibiotics due to the rise in drug resistance. drugs such as methicillin and vancomycin target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have now arisen and are of major concern.  inhibitors acting on new targets in cell wall biosynthesis are thus of particular interest since they might also restore sensitivity to existing drugs, and the cis-prenyl transferase undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (upps), essential for lipid i, lipid ii, and thus, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one such target. we used 12 upps crystal structures to validate virtual screening models and then assayed 100 virtual hits (from 450,000 compounds) against upps from s. aureus and escherichia coli. the most promising inhibitors (ic50 approximately 2 mum, ki approximately 300 nm) had activity against mrsa, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sp. with mic or ic50 values in the 0.25-4 mug/ml range. moreover, one compound (1), a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug epalrestat, exhibited good  activity as well as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) of 0.1 with methicillin against the community-acquired mrsa usa300 strain, indicating strong synergism.

TI  == modification of fatty acids in membranes of bacteria: implication for an adaptive mechanism to the toxicity of carbon nanotubes.
AB  == we explored whether bacteria could respond adaptively to the presence of carbon nanotubes (cnts) by investigating the influence of cnts on the viability, composition of fatty acids, and cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria in aqueous medium for 24 h exposure. the cnts included long single-walled carbon nanotubes (l-swcnts), short single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-swcnts), short carboxyl single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-swcnt-cooh), and aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (a-mwcnts). the bacteria included three common model bacteria, staphyloccocus aureus (gram-positive), bacillus subtilis (gram-positive), and escherichia coli (gram-negative), and one polybrominated diphenyl ether degrading strain, ochrobactrum sp. (gram-negative). generally, l-swcnts were the most toxic to bacteria, whereas s-swcnt-cooh showed the mildest bacterial toxicity. ochrobactrum sp. was more susceptible to the toxic effect of cnts than e. coli. compared to the control in the absence of cnts, the viability of ochrobactrum sp. decreased from 71.6-81.4% to 41.8-70.2%, and e. coli from 93.7-104.0% to 67.7-91.0% when cnt concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg l(-1). the cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria increased with cnt concentration, and a significant negative correlation existed between the bacterial viabilities and membrane fluidity for e. coli and ochrobactrum sp. (p < 0.05), indicating that the increase in membrane fluidity induced by cnts was an important factor causing the inactivation of bacteria. in the presence of cnts, e. coli and ochrobactrum sp. showed elevation in the level of saturated fatty acids accompanied with reduction in unsaturated fatty acids, compensating for the fluidizing effect of cnts. this demonstrated that bacteria could modify their composition of fatty acids to adapt to the toxicity of cnts. in contrast, s. aureus and b. subtilis exposed to cnts increased the proportion of branched-chain fatty acids and decreased the level of straight-chain fatty acids, which was also favorable to counteract the toxic effect of cnts. this study suggests that the bacterial tolerances to cnts are associated with both the adaptive modification of fatty acids in the membrane and the physicochemical properties of cnts. this is the first report about the physiologically adaptive response of bacteria to cnts, and may help to further understand the ecotoxicological effects of cnts.

TI  == multiplex pcr (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella sp., vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (penaeus monodon).
AB  == the coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. pcr based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. the objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and  specificity) of the multiplex pcr assay for detection of vibrio cholerae, vibrio  parahaemolyticus, salmonella sp. and escherichia coli o157:h7 from spiked shrimp  samples. the targeted genes were ompw for v. cholerae, tdh for v. parahaemolyticus, sefa for salmonella spp. and hlyehec for e. coli o157:h7. the genomic dna was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). the genes were  amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. twenty different uniplex and multiplex pcr assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex pcr are comparable to that of the results of uniplex pcr for the samples. dna extracted from shrimp samples spiked  with non-target pathogen (bacillus cereus, shigella flexneri and staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of 3,3'-phenylmethylene-bis-4-hydroxycoumarins:  selective and potent inhibitors of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the nad(p)h-dependent flavoproteins. in this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. however, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. this finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of s. aureus flavoprotein. 3d-qsar study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. comfa and  comsia contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. the results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.

TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == exopolymers from tolypothrix tenuis and three anabaena sp. (cyanobacteriaceae) as novel blood clotting agents for wound management.
AB  == rapid initiation of clotting is critical to trauma patients. in the present study exopolymers (eps) from four desert cyanobacteria including tolypothrix tenuis and three species of anabaena have been discovered as potential hemostatic biomaterials. the eps showed reduction in activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) and prothrombin time (pt) by 16-41% and 12-65%, respectively. besides hastening blood clotting, the eps could absorb 7.1-25.9 g h(2)o g(-1) ep and displayed 7.1-18.1% hydrophobicity. they were noncytotoxic and biodegradable. the ep from anabaena sp. showed strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, s. aureus and b. licheniformis. these results suggest that cyanobacteria, the microscopic phototrophs growing rapidly over simple mineral medium could prove to be a novel source of affordable hemostatic dressings for the traumatic wounds in  underdeveloped and developing countries. compositional analysis of the eps showed them to be consisting of mainly carbohydrate (17-50%), protein (4.4-7.2%), uronic acid (4.7-9.5%) and sulphate (0.6-6.6%). their viscometric molecular weight ranged from 539 to 3679 kda. they were further characterized using gc-ms and ftir.

TI  == effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  == background: skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. we studied the effect of substance p  (sp), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. methodology/principal findings: bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. exposure to sp strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of b. cereus (+553+/-3% with sp 10(-6) m) and this effect was rapid  (<5 min). infection of keratinocytes with sp treated b. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. secretome analysis revealed that sp stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the s-layer and the release of s-layer proteins. meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of b. cereus was increased. the thermo  unstable ribosomal elongation factor (ef-tu) was identified as the sp binding site in b. cereus. other gram positive skin bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to sp by an increase of virulence. thermal water from uriage-les-bains and an artificial polysaccharide (teflose(r)) were capable to antagonize the effect of sp on bacterial virulence.  conclusions/significance: sp is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. our study suggests that a direct effect of sp on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.

TI  == paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in india.
AB  == parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. generally, sewage treatment plants (stps) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. in this study, bacteria in stp effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. the susceptibility was in the order of staphylococcus aureus > bacillus sp. >escherichia coli > pseudomonas aeruginosa. gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control  and gram-positive bacteria. further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. the increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. this is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of indian stps. paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.

TI  == [expression optimization and characterization of tenebrio molitor antimicrobiol peptides tmamp1m in escherichia coli].
AB  == to improve the expression level of tmamp1m gene from tenebrio molitor in escherichia coli, we studied the effects of expression level and activity of the  fusion protein his-tmamp1m by conditions, such as culture temperature, inducing time and the final concentration of inductor isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). we analyzed the optimum expression conditions by tricine-sds-page electrophoresis, meanwhile, detected its antibacterial activity by using agarose cavity diffusion method. the results suggest that when inducing the recombinant plasmid with a final iptg concentration of 0.1 mmol/l at 37 degrees c for 4 h, there was the highest expression level of fusion protein his-tmamp1m in escherichia coli. under these conditions, the expression of fusion protein accounted for 40% of the total cell  lysate with the best antibacterial activity. we purified the fusion protein his-tmamplm with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni-nta) metal-affinity chromatography matrices. western blotting analysis indicates that the his monoclonal antibody could be specifically bound to fusion protein his-tmamplm. after expression by inducing, the fusion protein could inhibit the growth of host cell transformed by pet30a-tmamp1m. the fusion protein his-tmamp1m had better stability and remained higher antibacterial activities when incubated at 100 degrees c for 10 h, repeated freeze thawing at -20 degrees c, dissolved in strong acid and alkali, or treated by organic solvents and protease. moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration results demonstrated that the fusion protein his-tmamp1m has a good antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus sp., corynebacterium glutamicum, bacillus thuringiensis, corynebacterium sp. this study laid the foundation to promote the application of  insect antimicrobial peptides and further research.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of photocatalytic ionisation as a disinfection method for filter materials contaminated by microorganisms, and to assess how air relative humidity (rh), time and microbe type influence the effectiveness of this disinfection. in the quantitative analysis of a used car air filter, bacterial contamination equalled 1.2 x 10(5) cfu/cm2, fungal contamination was 3.8 x 10(6) cfu/cm2, and the isolated microorganisms were aspergillus niger, bacillus megaterium, cladosporium herbarum, cryptococcus laurenti, micrococcus sp., rhodotorula glutinis and staphylococcus cohnii. in the model experiment, three isolates (c. herbarum, r. glutinis, s. cohnii) and 3 atcc species (a. niger, e. coli, s. aureus) were used  for photocatalytic ionisation disinfection. the conditions of effective photocatalytic ionisation disinfection (r > or = 99.9%) were established as 2-3 h at rh = 77% (bacteria) and 6-24 h at rh = 53% (fungi). rh has an influence on the effectiveness of the photocatalytic disinfection process; the highest effectiveness was obtained for bacteria at rh = 77%, with results 5% higher than  for rh = 49%. the studies show that the sensitivity of microorganisms to photocatalytic ionisation disinfection is ordered as follows: gram-positive bacteria (s. cohnii, s. aureus), gram-negative bacteria (e. coli), yeasts (r. glutinis), and moulds (c. herbarum, a. niger). of all the mathematical models used for the description of death dynamics after photocatalytic ionisation disinfection, the chick-watson model is the most useful, but for more resistant microorganisms, the delayed chick-watson model is highly recommended. it therefore seems, that the presented disinfection method of photocatalytic ionisation can be successfully used to clean filtration materials.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  == biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were  evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium  sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the  presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against  the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of  molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == antibacterial activity of pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  == corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. the present study characterizes cultivable pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern gulf of eilat, red sea, israel. six mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. five of the six pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against gram-positive-but not gram-negative-tester strains. active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. the pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. these results suggest that coral mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential gram-positive  coral pathogens.

TI  == the importance of being regular: caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus defecation mutants are hypersusceptible to bacterial pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens have shaped the evolution and survival of organisms throughout history, but little is known about the evolution of virulence mechanisms and the counteracting defence strategies of host species. the nematode model organisms, caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus, feed on a wealth of bacteria in their natural soil environment, some of which can cause mortality. previously, we have shown that these nematodes differ in their susceptibility to a range of human and insect pathogenic bacteria, with p. pacificus showing extreme resistance compared with c. elegans. here, we isolated  400 strains of bacillus from soil samples and fed their spores to both nematodes. spores of six bacillus strains were found to kill c. elegans but not p. pacificus. while the majority of bacillus strains are benign to nematodes, observed pathogenicity is restricted to either the spore or the vegetative stage. we used the rapid c. elegans killer strain (bacillus sp. 142) to conduct a screen for hypersusceptible p. pacificus mutants. two p. pacificus mutants with severe muscle defects and an extended defecation cycle that die rapidly on bacillus spores were isolated. these genes were identified to be homologous to c. elegans, unc-22 and unc-13. to test whether a similar relationship between defecation and  bacterial pathogenesis exists in c. elegans, we used five known defecation mutants. quantification of the defecation cycle in mutants also revealed a severe effect on survival in c. elegans. thus, intestinal peristalsis is critical to nematode health and contributes significantly to survival when fed gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == detoxification of toxins by bacillithiol in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == bacillithiol (bsh), an alpha-anomeric glycoside of l-cysteinyl-d-glucosaminyl-l-malate, is a major low-molecular-mass thiol found in bacteria such as bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus and deinococcus radiodurans. like other low-molecular-mass thiols such as glutathione and mycothiol, bsh is likely to be involved in protection against environmental toxins including thiol-reactive antibiotics. we report here a bsh-dependent detoxification mechanism in s. aureus. when s. aureus newman strain was treated with monobromobimane and monochlorobimane, the cellular bsh was converted to the fluorescent s-conjugate bs-bimane. a bacillithiol conjugate amidase activity acted upon the bs-bimane to produce cys-bimane, which was then acetylated by an n-acetyltransferase to generate n-acetyl-cys-bimane, a mercapturic acid. an s. aureus mutant lacking bsh did not produce mercapturic acid when treated with monobromobimane and monochlorobimane, confirming the involvement of bacillithiol. furthermore, treatment of s. aureus newman with rifamycin, the parent compound of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drug, rifampicin, indicated that this thiol-reactive antibiotic is also detoxified in a bsh-dependent manner, since mercapturic acids of rifamycin were observed in the culture medium. these data indicate that toxins and thiol-reactive antibiotics are detoxified to less potent mercapturic acids in a bsh-dependent manner and then exported out of the cell in  s. aureus.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == cis-antisense rna, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  == a substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. however, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. the transcriptomes of bacteria as different as helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, mycoplasma pneumoniae, sinorhizobium meliloti, geobacter sulfurreducens, vibrio cholerae, chlamydia trachomatis, pseudomonas syringae, and staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense rna (asrna) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. bacterial asrnas share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory rnas, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. here, we review recent publications indicating that asrnas occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asrna actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. emerging functional data suggest that asrnas in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. thus, the functional impact  of asrnas should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic  bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.

TI  == bacillus subtilis cwlp of the sp-{beta} prophage has two novel peptidoglycan hydrolase domains, muramidase and cross-linkage digesting dd-endopeptidase.
AB  == for bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. we investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomi gene product (renamed cwlp). the gene is located in the sp-beta prophage region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome. inspection of the pfam database indicates that cwlp contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt) and peptidase m23 domains, which are similar to escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase slt70, and the staphylococcus aureus gly-gly endopeptidase lytm, respectively. the slt domain of cwlp exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the b. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (rp)-hplc and mass spectrometry revealed that the cwlp-slt domain has only muramidase activity. in addition, the  peptidase m23 domain of cwlp exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. remarkably, the m23 domain of cwlp possessed a unique zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized m23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to cwlp), which are zn(2+) dependent. both domains of cwlp could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of b. subtilis. however, the m23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of s. aureus or streptococcus thermophilus. the effect of defined  point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of cwlp is also determined.

TI  == isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern united states.
AB  == reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. in this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern atlantic coast of the united states. a total of 339 and 491 isolates from charleston, sc (chs) and indian river lagoon, fl (irl) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 chs/82 irl), fecal (141 chs/184 irl), and blowhole (128 chs/225 irl) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. the most frequently cultured gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas fluorescens. among the gram-positive bacteria, clostridium perfringens, bacillus sp., and staphylococcus coag. neg were the predominant organisms. for fungi, the most abundant species were candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and candida tropicalis. of concern, the mrsa strain of staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from chs dolphins. in general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from irl than chs animals. together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.

TI  == assessment of euphorbia hirta l. leaf, flower, stem and root extracts for their antibacterial and antifungal activity and brine shrimp lethality.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of the methanolic extracts of euphorbia hirta l leaves, flowers, stems and roots were evaluated against some medically important  bacteria and yeast using the agar disc diffusion method. four gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus sp., bacillus subtilis and bacillus thuringensis), four gram negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, salmonella typhi and p. mirabilis) and one yeast (candida albicans) species were  screened. inhibition zones ranged between 16-29 mm. leaves extract inhibited the  growth of all tested microorganisms with large zones of inhibition, followed by that of flowers, which also inhibited all the bacteria except c. albicans. the most susceptible microbes to all extracts were s. aureus and micrococcus sp. root extract displayed larger inhibition zones against gram positive bacteria than gram negative bacteria and had larger inhibition zones compared to stem extract.  the lowest mic values were obtained with e. coli and c. albicans (3.12 mg/ml), followed by s. aureus (12.50 mg/ml) and p. mirabilis (50.00 mg/ml). all the other bacteria had mic values of 100.00 mg/ml. scanning electron microscopic (sem) studies revealed that the cells exposed to leaf extract displayed a rough surface with multiple blends and invaginations which increased with increasing time of treatment, and cells exposed to leaf extract for 36 h showed the most damage, with abundant surface cracks which may be related to final cell collapse and loss of function. time-kill assay of c. albicans indicated a primarily fungicidal effect at 1- and 2-fold mic. e. hirta extracts had lc(50) values of 0.71, 0.66, 0.41 and 0.03 mg/ml for stems, leaves, roots and flowers, respectively against artemia salina. hence, these plants can be used to discover new bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == bacteriological screening of donor human milk before and after holder pasteurization.
AB  == background: in order to ascertain any bacterial contamination of donor human milk, we cultured milk samples both before and after holder pasteurization. methods: during 2003, all frozen donor milk samples were thawed and aseptically placed in pools prior to pasteurization. all individual and pooled samples were cultured and incubated for 48 hours. specific microbiologic identification of group b streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus,  alpha-streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus sp. was performed. gram-negative  rods (gnrs) were subtyped but not specifically identified. positive cultures were expressed in quantitative colony counts. results: samples from 303 pools and 810  individual mother's donor milk were cultured. forty-four pools (15%) represented  "preterm donor milk" from milk donated by mothers who delivered prior to 36 weeks of gestation. before pasteurization, 185 pools (62%) grew at least one lactose-fermenting gnr, and 58 pools (19%) grew a second lactose-fermenting gnr.  forty-four percent grew a non-lactose-fermenting gnr, and 20% grew an oxidase-positive gnr. the majority (87%) were colonized with staphylococcus. other gram-positive organisms identified included enterococcus (16%), alpha-streptococcus (8%), and s. aureus (4%). only one milk sample was positive for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the majority of pooled milk samples grew two or more organisms. milk from 22% of mothers did not grow detectable bacteria on routine cultures. the bacteriologic colonization profiles of milk from mothers delivering prematurely were similar to those of mothers delivering at term. after routine holder pasteurization of donor milk, 93% of milk samples showed no growth on routine bacterial cultures. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria contaminate human milk from donor mothers. most milk samples grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus and gram-negative organisms. although normal skin flora was cultured typically from milk samples, there were also many prepasteurization milk samples contaminated with pathogenic organisms. holder pasteurization was, however, an effective means by which to remove any detectable bacteria from samples of donor human milk.

AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == the swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (stasp-psi) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  == plant-specific insert domain (psi) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (ap) precursors. psi is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the n- and c-terminal portions of the  saposin like domain. hence, psi is called a swaposin domain. here, we report the  cloned, heterologous expression and purification of psi from stasp 1 (solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called stasp-psi. results obtained here show that stasp-psi is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. as reported for staps (s. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the stasp-psi ability to kill microbial pathogens  is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the saplip family, stasp-psi and staps are cytotoxic to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. the amino acid residues conserved in sp_b (pulmonary surfactant protein b) and stasp-psi could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by stasp-psi and staps against gram-positive bacteria. these results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the psi domain in mature staps could be related to their antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium fair-e 198 inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 au ml(-1)). however, none of the b. cereus and s. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. the maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 au ml(-1)) was observed in mrs broth, while the activity in milk was 100 au ml(-1). in the co-cultivation test in milk, b. cereus k1-b041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log cfu ml(-1)) after 48 h. e. faecium reduced the initial l. monocytogenes scott a population by 1 log cfu ml(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees c, however, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. e. faecium did not influence the growth of s. aureus atcc 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium fair-e 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

AB  == the diversity and antimicrobial activities of 80 fungi isolated from haliclona simulans were assessed using different fungal media containing either agar or gellum gum. in total, 19 different genotypes were detected. these fungal isolates could be classified as members of the agaricomycotina, mucoromycotina, saccharomycotina, and pezizomycotina, although the majority of the isolates were  associated with the latter class. some of these fungal isolates showed antimicrobial inhibition of escherichia coli, bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus, and candida glabrata. fungal 18s rrna gene sequences belonging to eurotiales, calosphaeriales, and chaetothyriales were amplified from dna and rna  extracted from this marine sponge. this study indicates that in contrast to the low diversity of fungi detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr amplification from extracts of this marine sponge, a much  higher diversity of fungi could be cultured. the data suggests that some fungi live in symbiosis with h. simulans, whereas other fungi may have been ingested from the surrounding seawater.

AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == the lantibiotic mersacidin is a strong inducer of the cell wall stress response of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the lantibiotic mersacidin is an antimicrobial peptide of 20 amino acids that is ribosomally produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728. mersacidin acts by complexing the sugar phosphate head group of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii, thereby inhibiting the transglycosylation reaction of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. results: here, we studied the growth of staphylococcus aureus in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of mersacidin. transcriptional data revealed an extensive induction of the cell wall stress response, which is partly controlled by the two-component regulatory system vrasr. in contrast to other cell wall-active antibiotics such as vancomycin, very low concentrations of mersacidin (0.15xmic) were sufficient for  induction. interestingly, the cell wall stress response was equally induced in vancomycin intermediately resistant s. aureus (visa) and in a highly susceptible  strain. since the transcription of the vrade abc transporter genes was induced up to 1700-fold in our experiments, we analyzed the role of vrade in the response to mersacidin. however, the deletion of the vrae gene did not result in an increased susceptibility to mersacidin compared to the wild type strain. moreover, the efficacy of mersacidin was not affected by an increased cell wall thickness, which is part of the visa-type resistance mechanism and functions by trapping the vancomycin molecules in the cell wall before they reach lipid ii. therefore, the  relatively higher concentration of mersacidin at the membrane might explain why mersacidin is such a strong inducer of vrasr compared to vancomycin. conclusion:  in conclusion, mersacidin appears to be a strong inducer of the cell wall stress  response of s. aureus at very low concentrations, which reflects its general mode of action as a cell wall-active peptide as well as its use of a unique target site on lipid ii. additionally, mersacidin does not seem to be a substrate for the resistance transporter vrade.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == a detailed analysis of 16s ribosomal rna gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (v1-v9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. no single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. we characterized v1-v8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, cdc-defined select agents and environmental microflora. sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions v1-v8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate  for dna probing and real-time pcr. we determined that v1 best differentiated among staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus sp. v2 and v3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. v2 best distinguished among mycobacterium species and v3 among haemophilus species. the 58 nucleotides-long v6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. v6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all cdc-defined select  agents including bacillus anthracis, which differed from b. cereus by a single polymorphism. v4, v5, v7 and v8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. the hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the  "megalign" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.

TI  == chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus aa11.
AB  == approximately 63 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. e. coli, salmonella sp. and shigella sp.). lactobacillus acidophilus aa11 produced a more  antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. the agent aa11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees c. activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. the compound was produced during growth phase and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12 % sds-page analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kda and approximately 29 kda. no plasmid was identified in lactobacillus acidophilus aa11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory  agent located on the chromosome. these characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin aa11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.

TI  == [new container of sample: role in the reduction of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units].
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of unstable blood products constitutes today  the most frequent infectious risk transmitted by blood transfusion. platelet concentrates are often incrimineted. as responsible germs are in general of cutaneous origin, a sample procedure with diversion of the first 20 ml during blood donation is studied. the aim of this study is to evaluate the results of this technique on bacterial contamination rate of standard platelet units prepared at the regional blood transfusion center in casablanca. study design and methods: a comparative study of two types of sample pockets is made: 500 standard platelet concentrates (cps) are prepared after collection using standard triple bags (baxter) (group 1) and 560 pockets of cps were prepared after collection using triple bags with sample diversion pouch sampling system for elimination of  the first 20 ml of donation (macopharma and terumo) (group 2). the skin was disinfected in two times with alcohol 70%. the bacteriological study was made in  the two groups at the third day of conservation. results: six cps of group 1 were contaminated, of which five were staphylococci coagulase negative and one bacillus sp. six cps of group 2 were contaminated, of which five were staphylococci coagulase negative and one staphylococcus aureus. the bacteria isolated were those of cutaneous flora at 100%. diversion of first 20 ml of blood donation results in a 16.6% reduction in bacterial contamination of cps (p>0.05). conclusion: the non-significant reduction in the prevalence of the bacterial infection of cp formulates the problem of the indication of the sampling devices  with derivation of first 20 ml during blood collection.

TI  == chilling and cultivar type affect the diversity of bacterial endophytes colonizing sweet pepper (capsicum anuum l.).
AB  == a climate chamber experiment was conducted to assay the effect of low temperatures (chilling) on the diversity of bacteria colonizing the endospheres of two thermophilic sweet pepper (capsicum anuum l.) cultivars, milder spiral and ziegenhorn bello. structural diversity was analyzed by 16s rrna-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and by the generation  of 16s rrna gene libraries to determine dominant community members in t-rflp profiles. cultivable community members colonizing lines milder spiral and ziegenhorn bello were identified by 16s rrna gene analysis. t-rflp profiles and 16s rrna gene libraries revealed a high heterogeneity of community composition due to chilling and suggested further the existence of cultivar-specific communities. the majority of isolates obtained from the cultivar milder spiral were assigned as high-g+c gram-positive bacteria (microbacterium sp., micrococcus sp., rhodococcus sp.) and firmicutes (staphylococcus sp.). of the isolated endophytes obtained from cultivar zeigenhorn bello, 93% were affiliated with staphylococcus aureus and bacillus sp. (firmicutes). the experimental set-up was  suited to demonstrate that chilling and cultivar type can influence the diversity of bacterial endophytes colonizing sweet pepper. we propose additional chilling experiments to investigate the effect of chilling on functional, plant-beneficial abilities of bacterial endophytes associated with low-temperature-sensitive crops, such as sweet pepper.

TI  == the smr gene resides on a novel plasmid psp187 identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from unpasteurized milk.
AB  == this work describes a novel plasmid psp187 (5550 bp) carrying the small multidrug resistance determinant smr encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs). psp187 was identified in a staphylococcus pasteuri isolate recovered from bulk milk in a dairy cattle herd in norway. sequence analysis revealed 6 putative orfs in addition to the smr gene within a cassette with identical genetic organization to that found in the psk41-like staphylococcus aureus plasmid ptz22. a protein homology search suggested the gene product of orf7 to be a putative replication initiation protein, while orf2 was predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of ftsk/spoiiie cell division-dna segregation protein families. sequence similarities to some initiator proteins of rolling circle replicons (rcr) indicated that psp187 uses a rcr mode of replication, supported by the detection of intermediate ssdna using s1 nuclease treatment and hybridization analysis. interestingly, a 30-bp sequence found upstream from orf7  showed high similarity to other dyad symmetry motifs proposed as putative double-strand origins of replication in the plasmids pgi3 (bacillus thuringiensis), pstk1 (bacillus stearothermophilus), and per1-2 (streptococcus thermophilus). in conclusion: the novel smr-containing plasmid psp187 is the first member of rcr group vi to be identified in a staphylococcus sp.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16.
AB  == the strain lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (bac217; approximately 7 kda). the onset of bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees c, respectively, when culture entered  the early stationary phase. biochemical characterization showed that bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of ph 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months or -20 degrees c for up to 12 months. however, bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. bgbuk2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. interestingly, bac217 showed activity against salmonella sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853. the inhibitory effect of bgbuk2-16 on the growth of s. aureus in mixed culture was observed. s. aureus treatment with bac217 led to a considerable decrease (cfu/ml) within a short period of time. the mode of bac217 action on s. aureus was identified as bactericidal. it should be noted that the strain bgbuk2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

AB  == this research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge irciniafelix. this activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). the susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis. the use of the chromatographic techniques (clv and tlc), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which  only the etoac and meoh fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. of the etoac fractionation, only fraction number 3 etoac/hex presented greatest activity against the gram-positive bacteria. number 1 etoac/hex fraction increased its activity against s. aureus (24 mm) and s. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. the cmi trials were carried out for the etoac number i subfraction against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. cereus and b. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.

AB  == enzymes from thermophiles are preferred for industrial applications because they  generally show improved tolerance to temperature, pressure, solvents, and ph as compared with enzymes from mesophiles. however, nearly all thermostable enzymes used in industrial applications or available commercially are produced as recombinant enzymes in mesophiles, typically escherichia coli. the development of high-temperature bioprocesses, particularly those involving cofactor-requiring enzymes and/or multi-step enzymatic pathways, requires a thermophilic host. the extreme thermophile most amenable to genetic manipulation is thermus thermophilus, but the study of expression of heterologous genes in t. thermophilus is in its infancy. while several heterologous genes have previously  been expressed in t. thermophilus, the data reported here include the first examples of the functional expression of a gene from an archaeal hyperthermophile ( bgla from pyrococcus woesei), a cofactor-requiring enzyme ( dszc from rhodococcus erythropolis igts8), and a two-component enzyme ( carba and carbb from sphingomonas sp. gtin11). a thermostable derivative of pnba from bacillus subtilis was also expressed, further expanding the list of genes from heterologous hosts that have been expressed in t. thermophilus.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == a global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  == attempted allelic replacement of 144 streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. of these, 14 genes (obg, spoiiij2, trmu, yaca, yacm, ydic, ydie, yjbn, ynes, yphc, ysxc, ytag, yloi and yxeh4) were also essential in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae or escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrk and ydib) were only essential in h. influenzae as well as s. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of s.pneumoniae and s. aureus and did not have a homolog in h. influenzae(murd2, ykqc, ylqf, yqeh, ytgp, yybq) or were not essential in that organism (yqel, yhct). the proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. the putative functions of some of these  essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to  be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting  that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. the results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including bacillus subtilis, e. coli and mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures  can produce apparently contradictory results.

AB  == new estimation methods of bacterial cell concentration in samples by measurement  of the increase in bacterial adenosine-triphosphate (atp) content during incubation using a conventional firefly luminometer were established. when an escherichia coli cell suspension was incubated in nutrient broth, the increase in the atp content of the suspension during the incubation period followed a sigmoidal curve. the increase ratio of the atp content of the suspension at a given period of incubation (5 hours in this study) to the initial atp content was greater at higher initial cell concentrations. with this relationship, the initial cell concentration of a test suspension could be predicted from the measured ratio; this was called the end point method. on the other hand, the lag  period in the atp increase curve was longer at lower initial cell concentrations. a highly linear relationship was observed between the lag period and the logarithm of the initial cell concentrations. based on this relationship, a delay method was developed for prediction. the two relationships were also observed for bacterial suspensions of klebsiella sp., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas sp. these results suggested that the two methods have the potential to estimate the bacterial cell concentration of a sample suspension.

TI  == chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == munumbicins, wide-spectrum antibiotics produced by streptomyces nrrl 30562, endophytic on kennedia nigriscans.
AB  == munumbicins a, b, c and d are newly described antibiotics with a wide spectrum of activity against many human as well as plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria, and a plasmodium sp. these compounds were obtained from streptomyces nrrl 3052, which is endophytic in the medicinal plant snakevine (kennedia nigriscans), native to the northern territory of australia. this endophyte was cultured, the broth was extracted with an organic solvent and the contents of the residue were purified by bioassay-guided hplc. the major components were four functionalized peptides with masses of 1269.6, 1298.5, 1312.5 and 1326.5 da. numerous other related compounds possessing bioactivity, with differing masses, were also present in the culture broth extract in lower quantities. with few exceptions, the peptide portion of each component contained only the common amino acids threonine, aspartic acid (or asparagine), glutamic acid (or glutamine), valine and proline,  in varying ratios. the munumbicins possessed widely differing biological activities depending upon the target organism. for instance, munumbicin b had an  mic of 2.5 microg x ml(-1) against a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, whereas munumbicin a was not active against this organism. in general, the munumbicins demonstrated activity against gram-positive bacteria  such as bacillus anthracis and multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis. however, the most impressive biological activity of any of the munumbicins was that of munumbicin d against the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum, having  an ic(50) of 4.5+/-0.07 ng x ml(-1). this report also describes the potential of  the munumbicins in medicine and agriculture.

TI  == genetic characterization of the fusidic acid and cadmium resistance determinants  of staphylococcus aureus plasmid pub101.
AB  == we report the cloning of the fusidic acid and cadmium resistance determinants from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pub101. the pub101 fusidic acid resistance determinant was located on a 2.9 kb hindiii fragment. sequencing of this fragment revealed three putative open reading frames (orfs) of 213 (far1), 152 (orf152) and 170 amino acids (orf170), which are flanked by the right-hand end of insertion sequence is431/257 (is431/257rh) and a partial orf. far1 and orf152 demonstrated homology with a chromosomally encoded fibronectin-binding protein of listeria monocytogenes and the putative protein yost, found on the sp beta c2 prophage of bacillus subtilis, respectively. transformation of s. aureus with a construct containing a 949 bp far1-specific amplicon led to the isolation of a fusidic acid-resistant transformant, thereby identifying the pub101 fusidic acid  resistance structural gene. between orf152 and far1 we identified a unique 113 bp symmetrical element and other repeat elements that may be involved with the control of orf152 and/or far1 expression. hybridization of southern blots revealed that far1 was not located on the chromosome or plasmid content of a limited number of australian, uk and hong kong fusidic acid-resistant isolates. the pub101 cadmium resistance determinant was located on a 3.6 kb hindiii fragment that carried a caddx operon, remnants of two putative plasmid replication protein genes and is431/257rh. sequence analysis also demonstrated the presence of a single-stranded origin of replication, normally found on rolling circle replicating plasmids, within the putative promoter region of the caddx operon.

TI  == stethoscope: a friend or an enemy?
AB  == context: the stethoscope is a universal tool in the hospital that is in direct contact with many patients and can therefore be a vector in the dissemination of  bacterial infections. objective: to research the presence of bacteria, fungi and  yeast on the stethoscope diaphragm and the resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial drugs. design: descriptive, prospective, non-controlled. setting: a tertiary care hospital. sample: samples were taken randomly from 300 stethoscopes employed by medical staff (medical residents, medical students, nurses and nursing school students) and other sectors of the hospital. main measurements: three hundred stethoscope diaphragms used in several sectors of the hospital facilities by medical doctors (63 samples), medical residents (54 samples), medical students (106 samples), nursing school students (33 samples) and specific sectors (36 samples) were analyzed. material was collected randomly. it was collected with the aid of a sterile swab moistened in physiological solution, inoculated into brain heart infusion media and incubated in an oven for 24 to 48  hours. after this period, the samples were inoculated into blood agar, macconkey  agar and sabouraud media and identified by gram staining and biochemical assays.  an assay to test bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics was also carried out by the  kirby-bauer method. results: eighty-seven percent of the analyzed stethoscopes were contaminated. gram-positive cocci, yeasts, fungi and gram-positive and negative bacilli were isolated. there was no significant association between the  most predominant microorganisms and professional category. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus negative coagulase and bacillus were significantly more frequent in relation to the presence of more than one microorganism on the stethoscope diaphragm. conclusion: stethoscopes presented a high rate of contamination and their use without precautions can spread nosocomial infections.

AB  == we report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, pseudomonas sp. strain tk4. the sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. the recombinant 57.7-kda enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase c. the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at ph 8.0 and activated by mn(2+). the enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (nbd)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and nbd-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria ivanovii, and leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical  protein encoded in chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the c terminus of the tk4 enzyme. interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain tk4 lacking 186 amino acids  at the c-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the c-terminal region of the tk4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.

AB  == ethanolic and aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of landolphia owerrience root parts (whole-root, root-bark and root-wood) were tested for activity against ten bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion and macro-broth dilution methods, respectively. the ethanolic extracts of the whole-root and root-wood were active  against 100 and 80% of the test organisms, respectively. ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the root-bark were moderately active while the aqueous (cold and hot) extracts of the root-wood exhibited little or no activity. out of the nine extracts prepared, 66.7% were active against staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600, 55.6% variously against each of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 and local clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhi, 44.4% against proteus sp., 33.3% against bacillus subtilis atcc 6051 and 22.2% against e. coli atcc 11775. the agar-well-determined mic values for the ethanolic whole-root extract (0.78-50 mg/ml) were higher (indicating lower activity) than the corresponding macro-broth-determined values (0.39-50 mg/ml) probably because of slow diffusion rates of the active constituents of the extract in agar. on the other hand, the differences could be due to the effects of dmso used to dissolve the ethanolic extracts in the agar-well diffusion tests. similar discrepancies in the mic values detectable with the two test methods were apparent in the root-wood extract and the control drug, gentamycin, except that in the latter the agar-well-determined mic values (0.125-8.0 microg/ml) were lower than the macro-broth-determined values (0.125-64 microg/ml). the strong activity of the ethanolic extracts against known etiologic agents of diseases traditionally treated with l. owerrience root of similar preparations provides scientific justification for the use of the herb in ethnomedical practice in nigeria.

TI  == characteristics of surfactant protein a and d binding to lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan, 2 major cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == infection with gram-positive bacteria is a major cause of pneumonia. surfactant proteins a (sp-a) and d (sp-d) are thought to play an important role in the innate immunity of the lung. both proteins can bind to gram-positive bacteria. until now, it was not known with which surface component(s) of gram-positive bacteria sp-a and sp-d interact. lipoteichoic acid (lta) and peptidoglycan (pepg) are components of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. by use of a solid phase-based binding assay, lta of bacillus subtilis was shown to be bound by sp-d but not by sp-a. unmodified pepg of staphylococcus aureus was bound by sp-d. sp-d binding to both lta and pepg was calcium dependent and carbohydrate inhibitable.  these results indicate that sp-d interacts with gram-positive bacteria via binding to the cell wall components lta and pepg and that the carbohydrate recognition domain is responsible for this binding.

TI  == class ii broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  == we have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among bacillus and related species. this mer determinant was first described in bacillus cereus rc607 from boston harbor, usa, and was then found in various bacillus and related species in japan, russia and england. we have shown that the mer determinant can either be located  at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the bacillus species, and is carried by class ii mercury resistance transposons: tn5084 from b. cereus rc607 and b. cereus vkm684 (atcc10702) and tn5085 from exiguobacterium sp. tc38-2b. tn5085 is  identical in nucleotide sequence to tnmeri1, the only other known mer transposon  from bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like tnmeri1. tn5085 is  functionally active in escherichia coli. tn5083, which we have isolated from b. megaterium mk64-1, contains an rc607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a mera gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. tn5083 and tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from b. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. the sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

TI  == the na+/h+ antiporter of alkaliphilic bacillus sp.
AB  == the na+/h+ antiporter, which appears to predominantly contribute to the alkaliphily of bacillus halodurans c-125, was studied in an alkali-sensitive mutant of this strain and a transformant with restored alkaliphily. the alkali-sensitive mutant, strain 38154, which has lost the ability to grow above ph 9.5, was found to lack electrogenic na+/h+ antiport activity driven by deltapsi (membrane potential, interior negative), and it showed defective regulation of intracellular ph under alkaline conditions. on the other hand, a transformant carrying a 2.0-kb dna fragment from the parental genome that complemented this defect was able to maintain an intracellular ph lower than that of the external milieu, and it was found to have recovered the na+/h+ antiport activity driven by deltapsi. sequence analyses found that a 5.1-kb dna region contained four open reading frames (orf-1 to orf-4). direct sequencing of the corresponding region in mutant 38154 revealed a g-to-a substitution, which resulted in an amino acid substitution from gly-393 to arg in the putative orf-1  product. it has been recently found that a region homologous to the dna fragment  responsible for the alkaliphily of strain c-125 exists in the genomes of bacillus subtilis, sinorhizobium (rhizobium) meliloti, and staphylococcus aureus. these homologues are present as a cluster of seven orfs in each case. the shaa gene product of b. subtilis shows significant similarity to the orf-1 product of strain c-125. disruption of the shaa gene resulted in a decrease in na+/h+ antiport activity, and growth of the shaa-disrupted strain was impaired when the  external na+ concentration was increased. we conclude that the shaa gene encodes  a na+/h+ antiporter, which plays an important role in extrusion of cytotoxic na+.

AB  == a series of fourteen derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. the new compound  4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantane-methanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride appeared very useful for preparation of a number of n-substituted phthalimides. antimicrobial activity of  the newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-n-(5-carboxypentamethylene)p hthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-n-(l-alanyl)phthalimide was tested against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., micrococcus flavus and enterococcus faecium. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for these compounds against s. aureus  were 0.022 and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == bacterial colonization of toys in neonatal intensive care cots.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bacteria and fungi contaminating toys in neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu) cots, the colonization rates, and factors that influence them. methods: a cross-sectional, longitudinal bacteriologic survey of  all toys in the cots of infants in an nicu. all the toys in an infant's cot were  cultured weekly for 4 weeks. data were collected on the infant's postnatal age, the type of cot, whether humidity was added, characteristics of the toy, and any  infant infections. results: over the 4-week period, there were 86 cultures from 34 toys of 19 infants. bacteria were grown from 84/86 (98%): 84 of the cultures grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 50 micrococcus sp, 21 bacillus sp, 13 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 12 diphtheroids, 4 group b streptococcus, 3 s aureus, 3 nonhemolytic streptococci, 3 group d streptococci, 4 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and 2 coliforms. none grew fungi. the colonization  rate did not differ with cot type, presence of humidity, size of the toy, toy fiber length, or the fluffiness score. eight (42%) of the infants had positive blood culture results and 5/8 of the isolates (63%) were of the same type as that colonizing their corresponding toy. implications: with time, all the toys in nicu cots became colonized with bacteria. many were potentially pathogenic. toys may be reservoirs for potential infantile nosocomial sepsis. infant, newborn, toys, infection, neonatal intensive care.

TI  == stresgenin b, an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein gene expression, produced by streptomyces sp. as-9.
AB  == stresgenin b was isolated as an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein (hsp) gene expression from a culture broth of streptomyces sp. as-9 by silica gel chromatography and hplc. the molecular formula of the novel compound was determined as c11h13no5 by high resolution fab-ms analysis, and the structure was determined by uv, 1h nmr, 13c nmr, hmqc, hmbc, and noesy spectra. stresgenin b inhibited heat-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the human  hsp70b promoter in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells at concentrations lower than the concentrations for inhibition of dexamethasone-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv)-ltr promoter. the inhibition of heat-induced reporter gene expression was evident even when cells were exposed to stresgenin b only during heat stress treatment. moreover, the compound inhibited heat-induced syntheses of hsp72/73, hsp90, and hsp110 and thereby suppressed the induction of thermotolerance. stresgenin b showed moderate cytotoxic activities against several neoplastic cell lines and also showed antibacterial activities against micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus strains.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of extracts from arrabidaea bilabiata.
AB  == consumption of arrabidaea bilabiata fresh leaves produces a paraplegic syndrome in cattle. for isolation of the active principle, isopropanol and methanol extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the plant; these were administered to sprague-dawley rats at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, orally, to determine the presence of substances affecting spontaneous motor activity. the isopropanol extract produced significant increases of long-pause and short-pause  movements (112 and 54%, respectively). the methanol extract tended to increase motor activity, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the isopropanol extract showed allantoin was the major constituent. it was administered to rats, at doses of 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/kg. a complex dose-response curve was observed, but at the highest dose, there was a 52% increase in the number of long-pause movements. it was inferred that allantoin and the constituents of the alcholic extracts might not be responsible  for the paraplegic synndrome in cattle. the alteration of cattle motor activity could be caused by other non-alcoholic constituents. additionally, extracts were  assayed for in vitro activity against escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumonae , pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , bacillus sp. and candida albicans . all microbial strains were found to be resistant to the extracts with  the exception of c. albicans , suggesting a possible antifungal activity.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pip823 from listeria monocytogenes bm4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  == during mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. from the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were streptococcus faecalis (s. faecalis; 38%), escherichia coli (e. coli; 19%), acinetobactor calcoaceticus (a. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), micrococcus sp. (5%), bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis; 5%) and proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris; 5%). from the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were s. faecalis (23%), a. calcoaceticus (23%), e. coli (15%), micrococcus sp. (15%), b. subtilis (8%), p. vulgaris (4%),  staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4  pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. in both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. however, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. the vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any  bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. the  levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (eu), respectively. it was undetectable  in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 eu) and oviduct (2.2 eu) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. these results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.

TI  == mutations in bartonella bacilliformis gyrb confer resistance to coumermycin a1.
AB  == this study describes the first isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants conferring natural resistance to an antibiotic for any bartonella species. the bartonella bacilliformis gyrb gene, which encodes the b subunit of dna gyrase, was cloned and sequenced. the gyrb open reading frame (orf) is 2,079  bp and encodes a deduced amino acid sequence of 692 residues, corresponding to a  predicted protein of approximately 77.5 kda. sequence alignment indicates that b. bacilliformis gyrb is most similar to the gyrb protein from bacillus subtilis (40.1% amino acid sequence identity) and that it contains the longest n-terminal  tail (52 residues) of any gyrb characterized to date. the cloned b. bacilliformis gyrb was expressed in an escherichia coli s30 cell extract and was able to functionally complement a temperature-sensitive e. coli cour gyrb mutant (strain  n4177). we isolated and characterized spontaneous mutants of b. bacilliformis resistant to coumermycin a1, an antibiotic that targets gyrb. sequence analysis of gyrb from 12 cour mutants of b. bacilliformis identified single nucleotide transitions at three separate loci in the orf. the predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from these transitions are gly to ser at position 124 (gly124-->ser), arg184-->gln, and thr214-->ala or thr214-->ile, which are analogous to mutated residues found in previously characterized resistant gyrb genes from borrelia burgdorferi, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and haloferax sp. the cour mutants are three to five times more resistant to coumermycin a1 than the wild-type parental strain.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the best-known activity of staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which  contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 x 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. the cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. we now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. at a concentration of 0.001 u/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. by contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. a selective monocytocidal action was also observed  with sphingomyelinase c from bacillus cereus and a streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase a2 and phospholipase d at 100 u/ml were without effect. monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta,  soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble cd14 into the supernatant. thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. these findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.

AB  == bacterial species, which occur on the breast skin surface of adult (1 year old) white leghorn fowl with intact uropygial gland, were identified as : staphylococcus epidermidis, sarcina lutea, streptomyces sp. and a facultative diphtheroid belonging to the genus corynebacterium; s. epidermidis being the most predominant one. two species of bacteria, namely, staphylococcus aureus and proteus sp. were shown to colonize the skin surface after 60 days of captivity. extirpation of uropygial gland caused severe depletion of population of s. epidermidis, streptomyces sp. and diphtheroid. the effect was more conspicuous after 60 days compared to that after 30 days of the gland removal. on the skin surface of glandless fowls the population of s. aureus increased significantly and a new form identified as anthracoid bacillus became the most predominant species after 60 days. addition of total lipids from the free-flowing fowl uropygial secretion, as 0.2% suspension, to trypticase soya broth cultures of individual bacteria of fowl skin surface encouraged strongly the growth of s. epidermidis, streptomyces sp. and proteus sp. but suppressed the population of the anthracoid. when identical amount of diester wax or wax alcohol of the secretion was supplemented to the culture, more or less similar result was obtained. wax alcohol also had a mild inhibitory effect on streptomyces sp. wax acids, added to the culture (0.2%) suppressed population of all the bacterial forms except proteus sp., while the hydrocarbon fraction, which also contained some amount of squalene, produce an opposite effect.

TI  == assessment of difco esp 384 blood culture system by terminal subcultures: failure to detect cryptococcus neoformans in clinical specimens.
AB  == terminal subcultures were performed on 1,162 5-day negative blood culture sets which had been monitored by the difco esp 384, a continuous-monitor blood culture system. of these, 16 (1.4%) had growth upon terminal subculture. the isolates not detected by the difco esp 384 were cryptococcus neoformans (eight isolates), candida albicans (one isolate), staphylococcus aureus (two isolates) coagulase-negative staphylococcus (three isolates), bacillus sp. (one isolate), and corynebacterium sp. (one isolate). acridine orange staining was performed on  200 randomly selected negative blood culture sets from the study group. of these, two sets were positive and grew out c. neoformans, as did the terminal subculture. a review of patient's medical records indicated that many of these false-negative isolates were clinically insignificant. the difco esp 384 failed to detect 1.4% of the isolates in this study, 50% of which were c. neoformans, indicating a deficiency in the detection mechanism of the system. further studies demonstrated that while these isolates (c. neoformans) grew in the difco media, the system did not detect this growth when the standard 5-day protocol was used.

TI  == microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == background: posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are well recognized. the anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. the author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with hiv who  presented between august 1990 and may 1994. methods: review of records. results:  nine patients were women, and four were men. mean age was 35.2 years. the keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. the most common infecting organism was candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. other organisms included staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, staphylococcus epidermidis in four, bacillus  sp in two, and one each pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, micrococcus sp, and capnocytophaga sp. seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in  only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. conclusion: infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic hiv infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. the prognosis for recovery of vision in  these patients often is poor.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  == aims: the study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. methods: the normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined  preoperatively. swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) in 90%, propionibacterium acnes in 62%, corynebacterium sp in 18%, and peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. the lower fornices of 70% had cns, 47% p acnes, 6% staphylococcus aureus, 6% corynebacterium sp, and 6% candida. results: a sterile pmma intraocular lens was  touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. eighty two per cent of lenses grew cns, 18% p acnes, 18% bacillus sp, 12% s aureus, and  6% corynebacterium sp. a second sterile pmma intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. forty seven per cent of these cultured cns, 12% corynebacterium sp, and 6% bacillus sp. a high count of bacteria in the  operating field, especially cns and p acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. conclusion: special measures are needed before  and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.

AB  == the synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. a vector free digoxigenin-dutp-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the cloned plc gene of c.perfringens strain atcc 13124. in a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of c.perfringens were tested for plc. none of the strains failed in hybridization. presence of plc was even demonstrated in c.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. none different clostridia sp. tested, e.g. c.bifermentans, c.tertium, c.novyi, c.chauvoei, c.sporogenes, c.difficile, c.putrifucum, c.sordellii, c.botulinum, c. septicum and c.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with dna hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of c.perfringens plc.

TI  == mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  == mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (s. chatterjee, d. k. chatterjee, r. h. jani, j. blumbach, b. n. ganguli, n. klesel, m. limbert, and g. seibert, j. antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). incubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. biosyntheses of dna, rna, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and d-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. thus, unlike type a lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. the formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. in contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. these data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == plasmids designed to alter the antibiotic resistance expressed by insertion mutations in bacillus subtilis, through in vivo recombination.
AB  == numerous insertion mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are available in bacillus subtilis. however, many of them have been constructed in vitro by inserting genes from the staphylococcus aureus plasmids, pc194 or pe194, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (cm) or erythromycin (er). others are insertions of the enterococcus faecalis tn917 transposon conferring resistance to er. this paucity of resistance markers has been limiting the possibilities of constructing and studying mutants carrying two or more of these mutations in the  past. we constructed plasmids which can be used to change the antibiotic resistance expressed by preexisting chromosomal insertions, through transformation and homologous recombination. these vectors replace the pre-existing resistance to cm or er with new resistances to neomycin (nm), phleomycin (pm), spectinomycin (sp) or tetracycline (tc).

TI  == the femc locus of staphylococcus aureus required for methicillin resistance includes the glutamine synthetase operon.
AB  == tn551 insertional inactivation of femc is known to reduce methicillin resistance  levels in methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus. by use of cotransductional crosses, femc was mapped close to thrb on the smai-a fragment of the s. aureus nctc 8325 chromosome. the tn551 insertion femc::omega 2005 was found to interrupt an open reading frame coding for a putative protein of 121 amino acids which is highly similar to the glutamine synthetase repressors (glnr) of bacillus spp. downstream of femc, an open reading frame highly similar to bacillus sp. glutamine synthetases (glna) was found. northern (rna) blots probed  with putative glnr or glna fragments revealed that 1.7- and 1.9-kb transcripts characteristic of wild-type cells were replaced by less abundant 7.0- and 7.2-kb  transcripts in the femc::omega 2005 mutant. total glutamine synthetase activity was also decreased in the mutant strain; the addition of glutamine to defined media restored the wild-type methicillin resistance phenotype of the femc mutant. this result suggests that the omega 2005 insertion in glnr has a polar effect on  glna and that glnr and glna are transcribed together as an operon. these results  suggest that the loss of wild-type levels of glutamine synthetase and the consequent decrease in glutamine availability cause a decreased level of methicillin resistance.

TI  == screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == a screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-n-me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-n-me-xylopine mei (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three g(+) bacteria (bacillus cereus, micrococcus sp. and staphylococcus aureus) mic greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine mei (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and o-me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three g(+) bacteria (mic = 50-300 micrograms/ml). however, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two g(-) bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia) (mic = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-actinodaphnine(1),  (+)-n-me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine mei (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), o-me-armepavine methine (48) and o,o-di-et-n-me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities  against candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and other candida species (mic  = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).

TI  == nucleotide sequence of a chromosomal mercury resistance determinant from a bacillus sp. with broad-spectrum mercury resistance.
AB  == a 13.5-kilobase hindiii fragment, bearing an intact mercury resistance (mer) operon, was isolated from chromosomal dna of broad-spectrum mercury-resistant bacillus sp. strain rc607 by using as a probe a clone containing the mercury reductase (mera) gene. the new clone, pyw33, expressed broad-spectrum mercury resistance both in escherichia coli and in bacillus subtilis, but only in b. subtilis was the mercuric reductase activity inducible. sequencing of a 1.8-kilobase mercury hypersensitivity-producing fragment revealed four open reading frames (orfs). orf1 may code for a regulatory protein (merr). orf2 and orf4 were associated with cellular transport function and the hypersensitivity phenotype. dna fragments encompassing the mera and the merb genes were sequenced. the predicted bacillus sp. strain rc607 mera (mercuric reductase) and merb (organomercurial lyase) were similar to those predicted from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pi258 (67 and 73% amino acid identities, respectively); however, only 40% of the amino acid residues of rc607 mera were identical to those of the  mercuric reductase from gram-negative bacteria. a 69-kilodalton polypeptide was isolated and identified as the mera gene product by examination of its amino-terminal sequence.

TI  == some factors affecting isolation of clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  == clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (ci)]: human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in  cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog,  2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). quantification of c. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., c. perfringens and streptococcus sp., group g, inhibited isolation  of c. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.

TI  == origin of organisms infecting ventricular shunts.
AB  == results of skin cultures obtained before 413 of 505 operations for cerebrospinal  fluid-diverting ventricular shunt placement or revision in a pediatric population from april 1980 to may 1983 are analyzed and compared to results of cultures from 20 subsequent shunt infections. sensitivities to 11 different antibiotics were determined for each isolate cultured. the total operative infection rate was 20 of 505 (4%). gram-negative bacilli alone accounted for 3 of 20 (15%) shunt infections. one gram-negative bacillus/staphylococcus aureus infection occurred.  factors predisposing for gram-negative bacillus shunt infection were found in all 4 cases. the majority of shunt infections were caused by typical resident skin organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis alone, 9/20 (45%); staphylococcus aureus alone, 4/20 (20%); corynebacterium sp., 1/20 (5%); alpha-streptococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%); and micrococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%). only 4 (20%) of the 20 shunt infections were due to organisms identical to those originally grown from the skin. another 4 (20%) seemed to be infected with a strain of organism different from that initially recovered from the skin. the remaining skin organism shunt infections may or may not have come from the patient's skin. the data suggest that not all skin organism shunt infections arise from contamination by resident skin bacteria at the incision sites at the time of operation. alternate sources for the infecting organisms are discussed. the antibiotic sensitivity data on skin isolates and shunt isolates suggest that  vancomycin is the antibiotic best suited for prophylaxis against shunt infection  at our institution.

TI  == antibiotic activity of the pyrenocines.
AB  == pyrenocine a, a phytotoxin produced by pyrenochaeta terrestris (hansen) gorenz, walker and larson, possesses general antibiotic activity against plants, fungi, and bacteria. effective doses for 50% inhibition (ed50s) are 4 micrograms/ml for  onion seedling elongation; 14, 20, 20, and 25 micrograms/ml for the germination of asexual spores of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, mucor hiemalis, and rhizopus stolonifer, respectively. pyrenocine a also inhibits the linear mycelial growth of both p. terrestris and f. oxysporum with ed50s calculated as 77 and 54 micrograms/ml, respectively. gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to pyrenocine a than gram-negative bacteria. ed50s are estimated as 30, 45, and 200 micrograms/ml for the inhibition of growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, respectively, with pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to those concentrations tested. pyrenocine  a acts primarily as a biostatic rather than a biocidal agent with all organisms tested showing some degree of recovery when released from pyrenocine a. pyrenocines b and c show little antibiotic activity in the bioassays performed.

TI  == the nosocomial colonization of t. bear.
AB  == a national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the national institutes of health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. the program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (t. bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. one of the items used is a stuffed toy t. bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the t. bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. a prospective study of 39 sterilized t. bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. hospital acquired organisms cultured from the t. bear included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, corynebacterium acnes, micrococcus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus sp, and species of candida, cryptococcus, trichosporon, aspergillus and others. concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. although the t. bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

(in six). the effect of wearing a sterile headset for an  hour was investigated using 20 volunteers. after wearing the headsets, an increase of at least two log10 colony-forming units was observed in 11 (55 per cent) of the volunteers, a decrease was observed in one (5 per cent), and no significant change in the bacterial flora was noticed in eight (40 per cent). the study demonstrates the presence of potential pathogens in headset devices and the increase in the number of endogenous flora in individuals who wear these devices.

TI  == minimum bacterial density for bacteriophage replication: implications for significance of bacteriophages in natural ecosystems.
AB  == bacteriophage 80 alpha did not increase in number in cultures containing less than about 1.0 x 10(4) to 1.5 x 10(4) cfu of staphylococcus aureus per ml, but bacteriophage replication did occur when the number of bacteria exceeded this density, either initially or as a result of host cell multiplication. the minimum density of an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis required for an increase in the number of bacteriophage sp beta ci was about 3 x 10(4) cfu/ml. the threshold density of escherichia coli for the multiplication of bacteriophage t4  was about 7 x 10(3) cfu/ml. in the presence of montmorillonite, bacteriophage t4  did not increase in number until the e. coli population exceeded 10(4) cfu/ml. the mineralization of glucose was not affected in e. coli cultures inoculated with a low number of bacteriophage t4, but it could not be detected in cultures inoculated with a large number of phage. the numbers of bacteriophage t4 and a bacteriophage that lyses pseudomonas putida declined rapidly after being added to lake water or sewage. we suggest that bacteriophages do not affect the number or  activity of bacteria in environments where the density of the host species is below the host cell threshold of about 10(4) cfu/ml.

TI  == role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. the abundance of micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of m. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. the abundance of r. leguminosarum fell  in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. s. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake  water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance  probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the site of inhibition of cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the inhibition of growth and cell wall synthesis by 3-amino-3-deoxy-d-glucose (3-ag), which is known to be one of the constituents of the kanamycin molecule and a metabolite of bacillus sp., was almost completely overcome by glucosamine and n-acetylglucosamine in staphylococcus aureus but scarcely affected by d-glucose and d-fructose. the antibiotic did not inhibit the incorporation of [14c]glucosamine and [3h]n-acetylglucosamine into the acid-insoluble fraction, but rather enhanced the incorporation of [14c]glucosamine. on the other hand, it  inhibited the incorporation of d-[14c]fructose into the cell wall fraction but hardly affected the incorporation of d-[14c]fructose into the acid-insoluble fraction in the presence of pencillin g. based on these results, it is suggested  that the site of primary action of 3-ag is the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate from d-fructose-6-phosphate, which is catalyzed by glucosamine synthetase [ec 2.6.1.16].

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

AB  == the role of cytidine diphosphate (cdp)-glycerol in gram-positive bacteria whose walls lack poly(glycerol phosphate) was investigated. membrane preparations from  staphylococcus aureus h, bacillus subtilis w23, and micrococcus sp. 2102 catalyzed the incorporation of glycerol phosphate residues from radioactive cdp-glycerol into a water-soluble polymer. in toluenized cells of micrococcus sp. 2102, some of this product became linked to the wall. in each case, maximum incorporation of glycerol phosphate residues required the presence of the nucleotide precursors of wall teichoic acid and of uridine diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine. in membrane preparations capable of synthesizing peptidoglycan, vancomycin caused a decrease in the incorporation of isotope from  cdp-glycerol into polymer. synthesis of the poly (glycerol phosphate) unit thus depended at an early stage on the concomitant synthesis of wall teichoic acid and later on the synthesis of peptidoglycan. it is concluded that cdp-glycerol is the biosynthetic precursor of the tri(glycerol phosphate) linkage unit between teichoic acid and peptidoglycan that has recently been characterized in s. aureus h.

TI  == mode of action of glycine on the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the mechanism of glycine action in growth inhibition was studied on eight different species of bacteria of various genera representing the four most common peptidoglycan types. to inhibit the growth of the different organisms to 80%, glycine concentrations from 0.05 to 1.33 m had to be applied. the inhibited cells showed morphological aberrations. it has been demonstrated that glycine is incorporated into the nucleotide-activated peptidoglycan precursors. the amount of incorporated glycine was equivalent to the decrease in the amount of alanine.  with one exception glycine is also incorporated into the peptidoglycan. studies on the primary structure of both the peptidoglycan precursors and the corresponding peptidoglycan have revealed that glycine can replace l-alanine in position 1 and d-alanine residues in positions 4 and 5 of the peptide subunit. replacement of l-alanine in position 1 of the peptide subunit together with an accumulation of uridine diphosphate-muramic acid (udp-murnac), indicating an inhibition of the udp-murnac:l-ala ligase, has been found in three bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus cellobiosus and l. plantarum). however, discrimination against precursors with glycine in position 1 in peptidoglycan synthesis has been observed only in s. aureus. replacement of d-alanine residues  was most common. it occurred in the peptidoglycan with one exception in all strains studied. in corynebacterium sp., c. callunae, l. plantarum, and l. cellobiosus most of the d-alanine replacing glycine occurs c-terminal in position 4, and in c. insidiosum and s. aureus glycine is found c-terminal in position 5.  it is suggested that the modified peptidoglycan precursors are accumulated by being poor substrates for some of the enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. two mechanisms leading to a more loosely cross-linked peptidoglycan and to morphological changes of the cells are considered. first, the accumulation of glycine-containing precursors may lead to a disrupture of the normal balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis during growth. second, the modified glycine-containing precursors may be incorporated. since these are poor substrates in the transpeptidation reaction, a high percentage of muropeptides remains uncross-linked. the second mechanism may be the more significant in most cases.

TI  == bactericidal properties of the concentrated artificial kidney bath solution.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the ability of a 30 times concentrated dialysate fluid to support or inhibit growth of bacteria, and to evaluate its shelf life. the solution was inoculated with the following organisms in the logarithmic-growth phase: escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus, enteric streptococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., klebsiella-aerobacter sp., proteus sp., and bacillus subtilis. inoculated concentrate held at 37 c showed an exponential decrease in organisms for all species except b. subtilis, with no organisms recoverable at 24 hr. to determine the effects of temperature, solution inoculated with e. coli and s. aureus was kept at 4 and 20 c. lesser rates of bacterial decline were found at the lower temperatures, with some organisms surviving for 146 hr at 4 c. for the evaluation of shelf life, 2 liters of the solution was kept at room temperature in screw-cap bottles for 8 months; no bacterial growth occurred. the self-sterilizing property of this solution is important practically, since it removes another source of contamination from patients with reduced resistance to infection due to chronic renal disease or immunosuppressive therapy for renal homotransplantation.

TI  == repression of staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. ii. causes of inhibition.
AB  == two food bacteria, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas sp. cs-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. five others, bacillus cereus, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli h-52, aerobacter aerogenes, and achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 c for 10 min. inhibition was not caused by changes in ph, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. the concentrated antibiotic  material from e. coli h-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
