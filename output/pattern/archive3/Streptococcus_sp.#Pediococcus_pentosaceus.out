association of a 13.6-megadalton plasmid in pediococcus pentosaceus with bacteriocin activity.
pediococcus pentosaceus fbb61 and l7230, isolated from cucumber fermentations, produced a bacteriocin, designated pediocin a, which had identical activity spectra against species of pediococcus, clostridium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus. both strains possessed a 13.6-megadalton plasmid (pmd136). plasmid curing experiments suggested that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were encoded by pmd136. use of pediocin-producing strains in food fermentations is discussed.
