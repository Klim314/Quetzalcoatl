TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == artisanal and experimental pecorino siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and pcr-dgge analyses.
AB  == traditional artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheeses, and two experimental ps cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. the bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction  fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the 16s rrna gene to that of reference species. the culture-independent fingerprinting technique pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v6 to v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene of samples taken during artisanal ps cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. the dominance of streptococcus bovis and lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal ps was revealed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. comparison of  dgge profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental ps cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional ps cheese.

TI  == molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  == the development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. analysis of  rapd fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of  25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides,  leuc. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, strep. bovis, strep. uberis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. garviae, carnobacterium divergens, c. piscicola, aerococcus viridans, staphylococcus carnosus, staph. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, ent. sulphureus and enterococcus spp. the bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. two strains, belonging to strep. thermophilus and l. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; thel. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.

TI  == spherical lactic acid-producing bacteria of southern-grown raw and processed vegetables.
AB  == the frequency and levels of population of the spherical lactic acid-producing bacteria were determined on raw and processed yellow summer and zucchini squash,  a variety of greens, green beans, okra, southern peas, and butter and lima beans, and on fresh cucumbers and corn flowers. six taxa occurred consistently: leuconostoc mesenteroides, yellow-pigmented streptococci, streptococcus faecium,  aerococcus viridans, and s. faecalis and s. faecalis var. liquefaciens. the same  taxa occurred with the same order of frequency on processed, frozen vegetables, but with a marked decrease in the occurrence of s. faecalis var. liquefaciens. s. lactis, s. cremoris, s. equinus, s. bovis, and pediococci were isolated infrequently. no other member of the viridans group of the streptococci and no member of the pyogenic group was isolated. approximately 88% of the cultures were identified. total counts of the lactic-acid-producing bacteria rarely exceeded 10 per gram of sample, and there was a reduction by 90% during the second year of study, probably because of drought. only one bacterial species was found on 40% of the raw and 34% of the processed vegetable samples. two or more species or taxa were present on the remainder of 153 raw and 56 processed vegetable samples. a. viridans was present on squash, greens, okra, and southern peas, and its frequency of occurrence on vegetables suggests that plants are its natural habitat.

TI  == temperature-sensitive dextransucrase synthesis by a lactobacillus.
AB  == dunican, l. k. (cornell university, ithaca, new york), and h. w. seeley, jr. temperature-sensitive dextransucrase synthesis by a lactobacillus. j. bacteriol.  86:1079-1083. 1963.-dextran synthesis was found to be temperature-dependent in lactobacillus strain rwm-13. dextran was not formed above 37 c, although growth of cells occurred up to 42 c. logarithmically growing cells transferred from 30 c to 40 c ceased producing dextran while growth decreased nominally. an examination of the extracts of cells broken by sonic treatment showed that as the temperature of growth was increased above 37 c the production of dextransucrase decreased. by use of an inhibitor of invertase, 10(-4)m agno(3), it was shown that invertase replaced dextransucrase activity at temperatures above 37 c. in contrast to dextransucrase in leuconostoc mesenteroides, the enzyme in lactobacillus strain rwm-13 was constitutive and thus resembled that of streptococcus bovis. thermosensitivity of dextransucrase synthesis has not been observed in leuconostoc or streptococcus.
