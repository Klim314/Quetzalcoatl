TI  == phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  == the rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (vicia faba), beans (phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (cucumis sativus) and tomato, (lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. sequencing of the 16s rrna coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, exiquobacterium aurantiacum, pseudomonas veronii, micrococcus luteus,  brevibacillus brevis, arthrobacter sp. and flavobacterium psychrophilum. these rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of n(2) fixation, which makes  them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. the crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by  hgcl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) hgcl(2). rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. it was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.

TI  == antifungal and antibacterial activities of araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch heartwood lignans.
AB  == five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an meoh extract from araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria citrobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi mucor miehei, paecilomyces variotii, ceratocystis pilifera, trametes versicolor, and penicillium notatum, and in addition, the meoh extract was evaluated against aspergillus niger, candida albicans, fusarium moniliforme, f. sporotrichum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the gram-positive. however, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of t. versicolor and c. pilifera at 300  and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. on the other hand, the meoh extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as t. versicolor, fusarium spp. and trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
