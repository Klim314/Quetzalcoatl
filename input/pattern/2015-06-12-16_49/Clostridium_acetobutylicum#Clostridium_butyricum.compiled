TI  - Biotechnological potential of Clostridium butyricum bacteria.
AB  - In response to demand from industry for microorganisms with auspicious biotechnological potential, a worldwide interest has developed in bacteria and fungi isolation. Microorganisms of interesting metabolic properties include non-pathogenic bacteria of the genus Clostridium, particularly C. acetobutylicum, C. butyricum and C. pasteurianum. A well-known property of C. butyricum is their ability to produce butyric acid, as well as effectively convert glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (38.2 g/L). A conversion rate of 0.66 mol 1,3-propanediol/mol of glycerol has been obtained. Results of the studies described in the present paper broaden our knowledge of characteristic features of C. butyricum specific isolates in terms of their phylogenetic affiliation, fermentation capacity and antibacterial properties.
TI  - Lipid diversity among botulinum neurotoxin-producing clostridia.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum has been classified into four groupings (groups I to IV) based on physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA sequencing. We have examined the lipid compositions of 11 representative strains of C. botulinum and a strain of Clostridium sporogenes by 2D-TLC and by MS. All strains contained phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in both the all-acyl and the alk-1'-enyl (plasmalogen) forms. Five strains in proteolytic group I, which are related to C. sporogenes, contained varying amounts of an ethanolamine-phosphate derivative of N-acetylglucosaminyl-diradylglycerol, which is also present in C. sporogenes. Three strains in group II, which are related to Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium beijerinckii and Clostridium acetobutylicum, contained lipids characteristic of these saccharolytic species: a glycerol acetal and a PG acetal of the plasmalogen form of PE. Two group III strains, which are related to Clostridium novyi, contained amino-acyl derivatives of PG, which are also found in C. novyi. A strain in group IV had PE, PG and CL, but none of the distinguishing lipids. This work shows that the lipidome of C. botulinum is consistent with its classification by other methods.
TI  - Effects of different replicons in conjugative plasmids on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression and n-butanol biosynthesis in Clostridium tyrobutyricum.
AB  - Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 can produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen as the main products from various carbon sources. In this study, C. tyrobutyricum was used as a host to produce n-butanol by expressing adhE2 gene under the control of a native thiolase promoter using four different conjugative plasmids (pMTL82151, 83151, 84151, and 85151) each with a different replicon (pBP1 from C. botulinum NCTC2916, pCB102 from C. butyricum, pCD6 from Clostridium difficile, and pIM13 from Bacillus subtilis). The effects of different replicons on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, adhE2 expression and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activities, and butanol production by different mutants of C. tyrobutyricum were investigated. Among the four plasmids and replicons studied, pMTL82151 with pBP1 gave the highest transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression, and butanol biosynthesis. Butanol production from various substrates, including glucose, xylose, mannose, and mannitol were then investigated with the best mutant strain harboring adhE2 in pMTL82151. A high butanol titer of 20.5 g/L with 0.33 g/g yield and 0.32 g/L h productivity was obtained with mannitol as the substrate in batch fermentation with pH controlled at ~6.0.
TI  - Butanol and ethanol production from tapioca starch wastewater by Clostridium spp.
AB  - Total (TWW) and tapioca starch wash wastewater (TSWW) from a cassava processing plant in Thailand were analyzed for their composition with a view to evaluate their potential as substrates for solvent production by ABE fermentation with Clostridium spp. Starch was detected at a 1.63-fold higher level in the TWW than that in the TSWW (24.4% and 15.0% (w/w), respectively). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was broadly similar (20,093 and 20,433 mg/L), but the biological oxygen demand (BOD) was 1.84-fold higher (18,000 and 9,750 mg/L) in the TWW than that in the TSWW. Thus, the TSWW was selected as a substrate to evaluate its potential for butanol and ethanol production by two Clostridium spp. The combined ethanol plus butanol production in the TSWW at pH 6.5 was higher than that at pH 4.5, being around 27.8- and 3.4-fold higher in C. butyricum TISTR 1032 and C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, respectively. In both strains, the butanol (and combined butanol plus ethanol) production level was improved at pH 5.5. The addition of yeast extract increased the bacterial cell production, but did not significantly improve solvent productivity in C. acetobutylicum, and even decreased butanol production by C. butyricum.
TI  - Functions of the Clostridium acetobutylicium FabF and FabZ proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The original anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway proposed by Goldfine and Bloch was based on in vivo labeling studies in Clostridium butyricum ATCC 6015 (now C. beijerinckii) but to date no dedicated unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme has been identified in Clostridia. C. acetobutylicium synthesizes the same species of unsaturated fatty acids as E. coli, but lacks all of the known unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes identified in E. coli and other bacteria. A possible explanation was that two enzymes of saturated fatty acid synthesis of C. acetobutylicium, FabZ and FabF might also function in the unsaturated arm of the pathway (a FabZ homologue is known to be an unsaturated fatty acid synthetic enzyme in enterococci). RESULTS: We report that the FabF homologue located within the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster of C. acetobutylicium functions in synthesis of both unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. Expression of this protein in E. coli functionally replaced both the FabB and FabF proteins of the host in vivo and replaced E. coli FabB in a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system. In contrast the single C. acetobutylicium FabZ homologue, although able to functionally replace E. coli FabZ in vivo and in vitro, was unable to replace FabA, the key dehydratase-isomerase of E. coli unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and lacked isomerase activity in vitro. CONCLUSION: Thus, C. acetobutylicium introduces the double of unsaturated fatty acids by use of a novel and unknown enzyme.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different proteins and their fragments from Bacillus thuringiensis parasporal crystals against clostridia and archaea.
AB  - Proteins of parasporal crystals (Cry proteins) from entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (subspecies kurstaki, galleriae, tenebrionis) as well as some fragments of these proteins, obtained by limited proteolysis, are capable of antimicrobial action against anaerobic bacteria and archaea-Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium acetobutylicum and Methanosarcina barkeri. The MICs are 45-150 microg/mL. Electron microscopy showed that lysis of M. barkeri cells in the presence of 49kDa fragment of Cry3Aa toxin is generally similar to the bacterial cell lysis, which has been previously detected in the presence of Cry11A, Cry1Ab and other Cry proteins. The Cry1D-like toxin from crystals of B. thuringiensis subsp. galleriae has been put forward as an example of the supposition that cell wall and some of its components like teichoic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine have possible influence on Cry toxins, enhancing their antimicrobial activity. The possible ecological role of the antimicrobial activity of Cry proteins is also discussed.
TI  - Microbial conversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol: physiological comparison of  a natural producer, Clostridium butyricum VPI 3266, and an engineered strain, Clostridium acetobutylicum DG1(pSPD5).
AB  - Clostridium acetobutylicum is not able to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source since it cannot reoxidize the excess of NADH generated by glycerol catabolism. Nevertheless, when the pSPD5 plasmid, carrying the NADH-consuming 1,3-propanediol pathway from C. butyricum VPI 3266, was introduced into C. acetobutylicum DG1, growth on glycerol was achieved, and 1,3-propanediol was produced. In order to compare the physiological behavior of the recombinant C. acetobutylicum DG1(pSPD5) strain with that of the natural 1,3-propanediol producer C. butyricum VPI 3266, both strains were grown in chemostat cultures with glycerol as the sole carbon source. The same "global behavior" was observed for both strains: 1,3-propanediol was the main fermentation product, and the qH2 flux was very low. However, when looking at key intracellular enzyme levels, significant differences were observed. Firstly, the pathway for glycerol oxidation was different: C. butyricum uses a glycerol dehydrogenase and a dihydroxyacetone kinase, while C. acetobutylicum uses a glycerol kinase and a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Secondly, the electron flow is differentially regulated: (i) in C. butyricum VPI 3266, the in vitro hydrogenase activity is 10-fold lower than that in C. acetobutylicum DG1(pSPD5), and (ii) while the ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase activity is high and the NADH-ferredoxin reductase activity is low in C. acetobutylicum DG1(pSPD5), the reverse is observed for C. butyricum VPI 3266. Thirdly, lactate dehydrogenase activity is only detected in the C. acetobutylicum DG1(pSPD5) culture, explaining why this microorganism produces lactate.
TI  - Hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobes.
AB  - Various anaerobes were cultivated in media containing glucose. When 100 mL of thioglycollate medium containing 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, Clostridium butyricum ATCC 859, NBRC 3315, and NBRC 13949 evolved 227-243 mL of biogas containing about 180 mL of hydrogen in 1 day. Although some strains had some resistance against oxygen, C. butyricum ATCC 859 and 860 did not have it. C. butyricum NBRC 3315 and Enterobacter aerogenes NBRC 13534 produced hydrogen in the presence of glucose or pyruvic acid, and E. aerogenes NBRC 13534 produced hydrogen by not only glucose and pyruvic acid but also dextrin, sucrose, maltose, galactose, fructose, mannose, and mannitol. When a medium containing 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, E. aerogenes NBRC 13534 evolved more biogas and hydrogen than C. butyricum NBRC 3315 in the absence of reducing agent.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Clostridium acetobutylicum for the industrial production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol.
AB  - Clostridium butyricum is to our knowledge the best natural 1,3-propanediol producer from glycerol and the only microorganism identified so far to use a coenzyme B12-independent glycerol dehydratase. However, to develop an economical process of 1,3-propanediol production, it would be necessary to improve the strain by a metabolic engineering approach. Unfortunately, no genetic tools are currently available for C. butyricum and all our efforts to develop them have been so far unsuccessful. To obtain a better "vitamin B12-free" biological process, we developed a metabolic engineering strategy with Clostridium acetobutylicum. The 1,3-propanediol pathway from C. butyricum was introduced on a plasmid in several mutants of C. acetobutylicum altered in product formation. The DG1(pSPD5) recombinant strain was the most efficient strain and was further characterized from a physiological and biotechnological point of view. Chemostat cultures of this strain grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. In contrast, when glycerol was metabolized in chemostat culture, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased and a very low level of hydrogen was observed. In a fed-batch culture, the DG1(pSPD5) strain was able to produce 1,3-propanediol at a higher concentration (1104 mM) and productivity than the natural producer C. butyricum VPI 3266. Furthermore, this strain was also successfully used for very long term continuous production of 1,3-propanediol at high volumetric productivity (3 g L-1 h-1) and titer (788 mM).
TI  - [Butyric acid bacteria of the genus Clostridium in the bottom sediments of inland basins of different types].
AB  - The cell numbers and ecological characteristics of the distribution of certain species of butyric acid bacteria (BAB) of the genus Clostridium in the bottom sediments of inland basins of different types were studied using the optimal nutrient media. The seasonal dynamics of clostridial vegetative cells and spores in sediments with different ecological conditions were revealed. The cell numbers of the dominant BAB species were shown to depend on the redox potential of the sediments, the amount and composition of C(org), and the trophic state of the basin in general. C. pasteurianum was found to predominate in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs (5-11 x 10(6) cells/cm3), C. butyricum and C. felsineum predominated in mesotrophic ones (2-11 x 10(6) cells/cm3), and C. acetobutylicum was predominant in acidic chthionoeutrophic lakes and reservoirs (0.1-0.5 x 10(6) cells/cm3). The lowest cell numbers of BAB were found in river sediments, whereas the highest numbers were recorded in the sediments of polysaprobic zones (0.1-1.0 x 10(3) and 0.5-2.0 x 10(7) cells/cm3 respectively).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of solventogenic, cellulase-free xylanolytic Clostridia from cow rumen.
AB  - Hemicellulolytic obligate anaerobes capable of converting a range of agricultural substrates and monomeric sugars of hemicellulose to solvents and acids were isolated from cow rumen fluid. The strains were identified as 5 strains of C. beijerinckii (3 different genotypes), 3 strains of C. acetobutylicum (2 different genotypes), 1 strain of C. butyricum and 3 strains of C. bifermentans (2 different genotypes). All of them produced cellulase-free xylanase activity. C. acetobutylicum LU1 produced solvent, a high of 5.1 gl(-1) and C.bifermentans LU1 produced xylanase activity a high of 4.2 IU ml(-1).
TI  - Formation of involatile methylantimony species by Clostridium spp.
AB  - Trimethylantimony was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the headspace of a soil enrichment culture designed to promote growth of clostridia. Clostridial isolates from the soil enrichment culture were shown to biomethylate inorganic antimony in monseptic culture, using hydride generation-gas chromatographyatomic absorption spectrometry (HG-GC-AAS). GC-MS profiles of headspace gases from soil enrichment cultures shown to generate trimethylantimony, were used to select characterised Clostridium spp for assessment of antimony biomethylation capability. Involatile methylantimony species (up to 21 microg Sb dm(-3)) were detected by HG-GC-AAS in the medium of monoseptic cultures of C. acetobutylicum, C. butyricum and C. cochlearium. The relative quantities of involatile mono-, di- and trimethylantimony species produced over the course of a 28-day cultivation period is consistent with trimethylantimony oxide being a final product of antimony biomethylation by these bacteria, with mono- and dimethylantimony species appearing transiently in the cultures as intermediates of an antimony biomethylation pathway. Clostridia may be the principal agents of antimony biomethylation in methanogenic environments and could give rise to methylated forms of antimony in both the aqueous and gaseous phases.
TI  - New solvent-producing Clostridium sp. strains, hydrolyzing a wide range of polysaccharides, are closely related to Clostridium butyricum.
AB  - Thirteen new Clostridium strains, previously isolated from soil and found to produce high amounts of solvents from glucose, hydrolyzed a great variety of alpha- and beta-glycans, including raw starch, xylan, pectin, inulin and cellulose. The sequences of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing the variable 3' part of one of the 16S rRNA genes were 99.5% identical. The macrorestriction pattern of two endonucleolytic digests of chromosomal DNA in the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) confirmed their high homogeneity on the DNA level. The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of three selected strains was 99.8% identical to the 16S rRNA gene sequence from Clostridium butyricum and separates them from C. acetobutylicum. To the closely related four species of solventogenic clostridia a new group of strains has to be added, which has a great potential for the direct fermentation of biomass.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding NADH-rubredoxin oxidoreductase in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - NADH-rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR), a flavoprotein from the obligately anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum is encoded by an ORF (nror) of 1140 nucleotides. Whereas primary structure analysis reveals that NROR has amino acid sequence patterns homologous with those involved in FAD and NAD-binding, the enzyme is distantly related to other flavoproteins in the databank. NROR is highly active for reducing clostridial rubredoxin (Rd) especially against C. acetobutylicum Rd with an efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of 400,000 mM(-1)s(-1). These results suggest that Rd from C. acetobutylicum, C. pasteurianum, C. butyricum, and C. cellulolyticum can be interchanged with each other. Since C. acetobutylicum is the sole Clostridium strain that possesses such an enzyme, possible functions are discussed with regard to Desulfovibrio gigas and Pyrococcus furiosus, the only two other anaerobic systems for which a similar activity was reported, but no gene isolated.
TI  - Regulation of carbon and electron flow in Clostridium butyricum VPI 3266 grown on glucose-glycerol mixtures.
AB  - The metabolism of Clostridium butyricum was manipulated at pH 6.5 and in phosphate-limited chemostat culture by changing the overall degree of reduction of the substrate using mixtures of glucose and glycerol. Cultures grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate, and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. In contrast, when glycerol was metabolized, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased, and a low level of hydrogen was observed. Glycerol consumption was associated with the induction of (i) a glycerol dehydrogenase and a dihydroxyacetone kinase feeding glycerol into the central metabolism and (ii) an oxygen-sensitive glycerol dehydratase and an NAD-dependent 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase involved in propanediol formation. The redirection of the electron flow from hydrogen to NADH formation was associated with a sharp decrease in the in vitro hydrogenase activity and the acetyl coenzyme A (CoA)/free CoA ratio that allows the NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase bidirectional enzyme to operate so as to reduce NAD in this culture. The decrease in acetate and butyrate formation was not explained by changes in the concentration of phosphotransacylases and acetate and butyrate kinases but by changes in in vivo substrate concentrations, as reflected by the sharp decrease in the acetyl-CoA/free CoA and butyryl-CoA/free CoA ratios and the sharp increase in the ATP/ADP ratio in the culture grown with glucose and glycerol compared with that in the culture grown with glucose alone. As previously reported for Clostridium acetobutylicum (L. Girbal, I. Vasconcelos, and P. Soucaille, J. Bacteriol. 176:6146-6147, 1994), the transmembrane pH of C. butyricum is inverted (more acidic inside) when the in vivo activity of hydrogenase is decreased (cultures grown on glucose-glycerol mixture). For both cultures, the stoichiometry of the H(+) ATPase was shown to remain constant and equal to 3 protons exported per molecule of ATP consumed.
TI  - Conjugative plasmid transfer from Escherichia coli to Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The conjugation mechanism of IncP plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from Escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. This strategy has been adapted for use with the Gram-positive anaerobe, Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052. Several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pAM beta 1 (Enterococcus faecalis), pCB101 (Clostridium butyricum) or pWV01 (Streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting oriT region of RK2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this organism. One of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of IS1. Conjugative mobilization of plasmids from E. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.
TI  - [The refining of liquid swine manure as a substrate for biotechnologic transformation processes].
AB  - Pure and mixed cultures of Clostridium Spec. were tested in sterile and nonsterile batch fermentations in order to increase the content of short chain fatty acid in different liquid swine manure substrates. Fatty acid concentrations of 15 g/l were reached by a thermochemical pretreatment of the substrates and the application of a mixed culture of Cl. acetobutylicum, Cl. butyricum and Cl. paraputrificum. The distributions of C2-C5 fatty acids were determined. The results represent the basis to intensify the process of the biotechnological conversion of liquid swine manure.
TI  - Production of 1,3-Propanediol from Glycerol by Clostridium acetobutylicum and Other Clostridium Species.
AB  - Glycerol was fermented with the production of 1,3-propanediol as the major fermentation product by four strains of Clostridium acetobutylicum, six of C. butylicum, two of C. beijerinckii, one of C. kainantoi, and three of C. butyricum. 1,3-Propanediol was identified by its retention times in gas chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography and by its mass spectrum. During growth of C. butylicum B593 in a chemostat culture at pH 6.5, 61% of the glycerol fermented was converted to 1,3-propanediol. When the pH was decreased to 4.9, growth and 1,3-propanediol production were substantially reduced.
TI  - Selective medium for isolation of Clostridium butyricum from human feces.
AB  - A selective medium, Clostridium butyricum isolation medium (BIM), is described for the isolation of C. butyricum from human feces. The BIM is a synthetic minimal medium and contains trimethoprim (16 micrograms/ml), D-cycloserine (10 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin B sulfate (20 micrograms/ml) as selective inhibitory agents. Qualitative tests indicated that C. butyricum and other butyric acid-producing clostridia grew on BIM, Clostridium sphenoides and Bacillus cereus produced small colonies, and other clostridia and other obligate anaerobic or facultatively anerobic bacteria were inhibited. Quantitative recovery of C. butyricum from cultures or seeded fecal samples was comparable with BIM and with complex medium, but the quantitative recovery of the other butyric acid-producing clostridia tested (C. beijerinckii, C. acetobutylicum) was lower with BIM than with complex medium. The BIM should aid the rapid isolation of C. butyricum from fecal samples and should be useful for bacteriological investigation of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
TI  - Lipid composition in the classification of the butyric acid-producing clostridia.
AB  - An examination of 20 strains of butyric acid-producing Clostridium species for phospholipid class compositions, plasmalogen content, and acyl and alk-l-enyl chains showed that the deoxyribonucleic acid homology groups I (Clostridium butyricum) and II (Clostridium beijerinckii) could be distinguished by their lipid compositions. The phospholipids of C. butyricum strains had ethanolamine as the major nitrogenous lipid polar head-group moiety, more octadecenoate plus C19-cyclopropane than hexadecenoate plus C17-cyclopropane acyl chains, and the predominant alk-l-enyl chain was C18-monounsaturated. Clostridium beijerinckii strains had N-methylethanolamine plus ethanolamine in phospholipid head-groups, more hexadecenoate plus C17-cyclopropane than octadecenoate plus C19-cyclopropane acyl chains, and the major alk-l-enyl chain was C16-saturated. Three species falling outside the two homology groups Clostridium fallax, Clostridium pseudofallax and Clostridium acetobutylicum had ethanolamine as the major phospholipid base, but these species could be distinguished from C. butyricum by their acyl and alk-l-enyl chain compositions. The lipid composition of Clostridium pasteurianum is even more distinct.
TI  - [Fixation of molecular nitrogen and activity of the microflora in the bottoms of  certain lakes in the Estonian SSR and the Rybinsk reservoir].
AB  - The rate of molecular nitrogen fixation was determined in bottom grounds of three Estonian lakes and the Rybinsk water reservoir in the summer of 1977--1978. Certain species of nitrogen fixing bacteria were found to be confined to lakes of certain trophic type. Ecological niches with the mass growth of Clostridium pasteurianum, Azomonas agilis and Clostridium butyricum were detected in the sediments of eutrophic lakes. Ecological niches of Az. insignis and Cl. acetobutylicum occur in polyhumic lakes. Ecological niches for the nitrogen fixing microaerophilic organisms Methylosinus trichosporium, M. sporium and Mycobacterium flavum can be found in the sediments of water reservoirs of any trophic type. The important ecological factors which favour the growth of microflora with a high rate of molecular nitrogen fixation in bottom grounds are as follows: a sufficiently high temperature, a weakly alkaline reaction, the presence of oxygen in the water near the bottom, and the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen about 10--11. The destruction of organic substances in such sediments involves both aerobic and anaerobic microflora, and Cl. butyricum is abundant among nitrogen fixing microorganisms.
TI  - [Number of butyric acid bacteria belonging to the genus Clostridium in the slimy  sediments of Volga reservoirs].
AB  - The number of Clostridium pasteurianum, Cl. butyricum, and Cl. acetobutylicum was determined in ooze deposits of the Volga River reservoirs using enriched nutrient media. The bacterial number for the two former species was about 1 + 10(6) cells per 1 ml of ooze with a high content of easily assimilated organic substances, thus being by 1--3 orders of magnitude higher than for Cl. pasteurianum on media without nitrogen. The bacterial number for Cl. acetobutylicum was 0.1--1 + 10(3) cells per 1 ml.
TI  - Allostery of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthetase in Clostridium: another conserved generic characteristic.
AB  - Enzymological studies were done to characterize the allosteric control of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthetase in three species of Clostridium. Allosteric control was identified as feedback inhibition by phenylalanine and was qualitatively similar for the DAHP synthetases of C. butyricum, C. acetobutylicum, and C. tetanomorphum. Quantitative differences in the enzymology and kinetics of allosteric control distinguished C. tetanomorphum from C. butyricum and C. acetobutylicum. Crude extracts contained apparent proteolytic activity which could be fractionated from DAHP synthetase. The proteolytic activity was more labile than DAHP synthetase in extracts and was progressively inactivated by serial freeze-thaw treatments. Protease activity was at least partially inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride. The method of comparative allostery of DAHP synthetase distinguishes the genera Bacillus and Clostridium, each having a strongly conserved pattern of regulation for DAHP synthetase. The data reinforce previous conclusions that allosteric control patterns governing the activity of DAHP synthetase are stable, reliable generic characteristics.
