TI  == validation of sterility testing of cord blood: challenges and results.
AB  == background: sterility testing for cord blood (cb) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. here, the automated bact/alert (biomerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in cb units processed at the canadian national public cord blood bank. study design and methods: a three-phase validation was developed. cb units  were prepared with pentastarch (phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (phase 3). in phase 1, cb was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. plasma (8 ml) and buffy  coat (bc; 0.5 and 8 ml) were inoculated into culture bottles. in phases 2 and 3,  a mix of red blood cells (rbcs) and plasma (4 ml each) was used as the inoculant. in phase 3, aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product rbcs and plasma were determined. the bc fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. results: in phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in cb units containing antibiotics. thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. c. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of rbcs and plasma, all organisms were detected. the use  of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. c. albicans and a. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in rbcs and bc. cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during cb processing. conclusions: a mix of plasma and rbcs is appropriate for cb sterility testing. interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. the clinical significance of the  bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in cb merits further investigation.

TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  == avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c beta-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry,  mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration  of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of  22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has  been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical  studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the  exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ss-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == relationship between the clinical efficacy and auc/mic of intravenous ciprofloxacin in japanese patients with intraabdominal infections.
AB  == the efficacy of fluoroquinolones (fqs) correlates with the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) parameter, auc/mic. to our knowledge, however, no prospective studies have reported the relationship between fq efficacy and pk-pd parameters in intraabdominal infection; therefore, we prospectively investigated the relationship between the efficacy of intravenous ciprofloxacin (cpfx iv) and pk-pd parameters. the study included 16 patients diagnosed with peritonitis between 2006 and 2008: 14 patients infected with a single organism and 2 patients infected with more than one organism. each patient was treated with cpfx iv (300 mg twice daily). the response rate was 56% (9 responders and 7 non-responders). non-responders were infected with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis (6 patients were infected  with a single organism and 1 with more than one organism). plasma drug concentrations were measured 1 h and 2 or 4 h after administration of cpfx iv. auc for 24 h (auc(0-24))/mic values was calculated. the range of auc(0-24)/mic values in responders [95.3-3628.4 (geometric mean, 521.6)] was significantly different from that in non-responders [7.0-45.2 (geometric mean, 16.5)] (p = 0.001). the target auc/mic value of cpfx iv would be considered to be 45-95 in patients with peritonitis.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

AB  == objectives: to determine the microbiological profile of breast abscess and assess the antibiotic susceptibility of the causative agents. materials and methods: data obtained from cases of breast abscess over a period of 3.5 years, june 2006  to december 2009, were retrospectively analyzed. specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. the antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using the methods recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. one specimen per patient was analyzed. results: of the 114 patients, 107 (93.8%) non-lactating and 7 (6.1%) lactating women were diagnosed with breast abscess during this period. of the 114 specimens, 83 (73%) yielded bacterial growth. of these, 115 pathogens were isolated with an average of 1.4 pathogens per abscess. eighteen (22%) of the 83 specimens yielded mixed bacterial growth. there were more gram-positive pathogens (60, 52%) than anaerobes (32, 28%) and gram-negative pathogens (22, 19%). the predominant organisms were methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (37, 32%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; 11, 10%), bacteroides spp. (16, 14%), anaerobic streptococci (14, 12%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (9, 8%). of the 48 s. aureus, mrsa accounted for 11 (23%). all mrsa isolates were susceptible to  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. conclusion: s. aureus was the most  common pathogenic organism isolated in breast abscesses at al-amiri hospital, kuwait, of which 23% were mrsa. nearly a third of the cases were caused by anaerobes, particularly b. fragilis. the data present a basis for the formation of empirical antimicrobial therapeutic policy in the management of breast abscess.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2009].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 2655 strains including 810 strains of gram-positive  bacteria, 1635 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 210 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2009 was examined. the results were as follows; (1) mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most  of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multidrug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). (2) mepm maintained potent and stable antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the proportion of mepm-resistant strains to ciprofloxacin-resistant strains or imipenem-resistant strains were 53.1% and 58.0% respectively. (3) the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (26 strains) in enterobacteriaceae. and the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 2.0% (6 strains) in p. aeruginosa. (4) of all  species tested, there were no species except for bacteroides fragilis group, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical  isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 14 years passed after available for commercial use in japan.

TI  == bpib05, a novel metagenome-derived hydrolase acting on n-acylhomoserine lactones.
AB  == the n-acyl-homoserine lactones (n-ahls) play an important role in bacterial cell-cell signaling. up to date, however, only a few different experimentally proven classes of n-ahl ring-cleaving enzymes are known. here we report on the isolation and biochemical characterization of a novel hydrolase derived from the  soil metagenome and acting on n-ahls. the identified protein designated bpib05 is weakly similar to hypothetical proteins from bacteroides fragilis, the draft genomes of two burkholderia species as well as a marine metagenomic orf but is otherwise not similar to any known protein. bpib05 was overexpressed in escherichia coli as a 10x his-tagged fusion protein. the recombinant protein revealed a molecular weight of about 70kda and was tested for its quorum quenching (qq) activities using a lacz-bioassay. additional hplc-ms analyses confirmed the lactonolytic activity of the purified protein in the presence of ca(2)(+). further tests suggested that bpib05 strongly reduces motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa, pyocyanin synthesis and biofilm formation in this microbe. because bpib05 is not distantly related to any of the currently known hydrolases it forms probably a novel group within the growing number of proteins  acting on n-ahls.

TI  == bacterial burden and wound outcomes as influenced by negative pressure wound therapy .
AB  == abstract: negative pressure wound therapy (npwt) has consistently shown significant clinical benefits in wound healing, but the mechanisms are not fully  elucidated. while a reduction in bacterial burden is one possible contributor, studies have shown mixed results in this regard. the present study used a porcine infected wound model to test the effect of npwt on bacterial burden. methods: infected wounds (pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and bacteroides fragilis) in a porcine model were treated with v.a.c.(r) therapy with the standard granufoam dressing, v.a.c. therapy with the granufoam silver(r) dressing, or moist gauze for a period of 7 days with three dressing changes. quantitative and semiquantitative bacterial cultures, histological samples, and digital photographs were taken at dressing changes. results: the wounds continued to show gross and microscopic improvement when treated with standard npwt and npwt with silver compared to moist wound care controls. however, the bacterial burden in all wounds continued to increase and broadened to include local skin flora, which had been absent immediately after wounding. these increases in bacteria were not affected by the use of silver dressings. conclusion: negative pressure wound therapy with either standard npwt foam or silver npwt foam produced significant improvements in local wound appearance. this occurred despite a persistently high level of bacterial infection; thus, the improvement in healing of these infected wounds cannot be explained by a change in the bacterial burden. .

TI  == intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == doripenem.
AB  == carbapenems play a significant role in the current antibiotic armamentarium. doripenem is the newest carbapenem to be commercially released. its antimicrobial spectrum more closely resembles those of meropenem and imipenem than that of ertapenem. thus, it has significant in vitro activity against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae (including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and bacteroides fragilis. doripenem does not have clinically useful activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and the majority of gram-negative bacilli that  are resistant to meropenem or imipenem. in vitro, resistant p. aeruginosa mutants appear to be harder to select with doripenem than with other carbapenems. doripenem has been approved for use in treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection. studies of hospital-acquired pneumonia have also been completed, including one that used a 4-h infusion to enhance the pharmacodynamic profile. in vitro, doripenem lacks the propensity to  cause seizures, and a low risk of seizures has been demonstrated in clinical studies. currently unanswered questions regarding doripenem include the utility and dosing in neonatal, pediatric, and cystic fibrosis populations and specific dosage recommendations for patients receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,  or continuous renal replacement therapies. the longevity of doripenem will depend on our ability to curtail the spread of carbapenem-resistant organisms, which are already a significant problem at some institutions.

TI  == bacterial indicators of pollution of the douala lagoon, cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == background: indiscriminate disposal of untreated wastes which are often heavily laden with sewage microorganisms some of which are pathogenic to humans into aquatic environments near cities could serve as potential dangers to human health. objective: a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the scope of potential bacterial pathogens and to assess the extent of pollution of the douala lagoon. methods: a total of eighty water samples were collected fortnightly from  the lagoon at five stations from march to october 2005 and analysed for heterotrophic bacterial densities, coliform counts, faecal coliform and faecal streptococcal counts. bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. results: high heterotrophic bacterial counts (33 x 10(5) - 161 x 10(5) cfu/ ml), total coliform counts (1.8 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/100 ml), faecal coliform counts (2.2 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/ 100 ml) and faecal streptococcal counts (2.1 x 102 - 2.3 x 10(2) cfu/100ml were observed in all sampling stations. eleven species of bacteria: bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus mycoides and serratia marcesens, were frequently isolated. conclusion: the presence of potential bacterial agents such as bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli in the lagoon may pose a serious threat to the health and  well being of users of the lagoon and calls for urgent intervention.

TI  == surface components of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objective: research on porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has provided a tremendous amount of information over the last 20 years, which may exceed in part than that on other closely related members in  terms of phylogenetic as well as proteomic criteria, including bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron as major anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens in the medical field. in this minireview, we focused on recent research findings concerning surface components such as outer membrane proteins and fimbriae, of p. gingivalis. material and methods: elucidation of the surface components in p. gingivalis was especially difficult because outer membrane proteins are tightly bound to lipopolysaccharide and they are resistant to dissociation and separation from each other, even during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, unless samples are appropriately heated. in addition, p. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and therefore a potent proteolytic bacterium, another factor causing difficulty in research. the study of the surface components was carefully carried out considering these unique features in p. gingivalis when compared with other gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: separation of outer membrane proteins,  and characterization of ompa-like proteins and ragab as major proteins, is described herein. our recent findings on fima and mfa1 fimbriae, two unique appendages in this organism, and on their regulation of expression are also described briefly. conclusion: surface components of p. gingivalis somehow have contact with host tissues and cells because of the outermost cell elements. therefore, such bacterial components are potentially important in the occurrence  of periodontal diseases.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic assessment of imipenem in the intraperitoneal fluid of abdominal surgery patients.
AB  == background: imipenem is used to treat intra-abdominal infections, however, this treatment would benefit from a better understanding of imipenem penetration into  the abdominal cavity. methods: imipenem 500 mg was infused to 10 laparotomy patients. the total drug concentrations in plasma and intraperitoneal fluid were  analyzed noncompartmentally and 3-compartmentally (population pharmacokinetic analysis), and used for a monte carlo simulation with minimum inhibitory concentration data. results: the auc(0-infinity) ratio of the intraperitoneal fluid to the plasma was 0.82 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- sd, n = 6). the pharmacodynamic exposures in the intraperitoneal fluid were higher than in the plasma. the probabilities of achieving a bacteriostatic/bactericidal target (20/40% of the time above minimum inhibitory concentration for 24 h) in the intraperitoneal fluid using a regimen of 500 mg every 8 h against the bacteroides fragilis group, escherichia coli and klebsiella species were 97.3/89.1, 98.8/97.2 and 100/98.2%,  respectively. however, a regimen of 1,000 mg every 8 h was needed to achieve 96.7/89.3% against pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: these results may help us  to understand the intraperitoneal penetration of imipenem and to determine the dosing regimen for intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == metal pins used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices protruding through skin are susceptible to the increased incidence of pin site infection. in this work, we tried to establish the photokilling effects of titanium dioxide (tio2) nanoparticles on an orthopedic implant with an in vitro study. in these photocatalytic experiments, aqueous tio2 was added to the tested  microorganism. the time effect of tio2 photoactivation was evaluated, and the loss of viability of five different bacteria suspensions (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and bacteroides fragilis) was examined by the viable count procedure. the bactericidal effect of tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates was also tested. the ultraviolet (uv) dosage used in this experiment did not affect the viability of bacteria, and all bacteria survived well in the absence of tio2 nanoparticles. the survival curve of microorganisms in the presence of tio2 nanoparticles showed that nearly complete killing was achieved after 50 min of uv illumination. the formation of bacterial colonies above the tio2 nanoparticle-coated metal plates also decreased significantly. in this study, we clearly demonstrated the bactericidal effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. in the presence of uv light, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles can be applicable to medical facilities where the potential for infection should be controlled.

TI  == presence of quorum-sensing systems associated with multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis constitutes 1-2% of the natural microbiota of the human digestive tract and is the predominant anaerobic opportunistic pathogen in gastrointestinal infections. most bacteria use quorum sensing (qs) to monitor cell density in relation to other cells and their environment. in gram-negative bacteria, the luxri system is common. the luxr gene encodes a transcriptional activator inducible by type i acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers (e.g., n-[3-oxohexanoyl] homoserine lactone and hexanoyl homoserine lactone [c6-hsl]). this study investigated the presence of qs system(s) in b. fragilis. the genome of american-type culture collection strain no. atcc25285 was searched for qs genes. the strain was grown to late exponential phase in the presence or absence  of synthetic c6-hsl and c8-hsl or natural homoserine lactones from cell-free supernatants from spent growth cultures of other bacteria. growth, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, efflux pump gene (bmeb) expression, and biofilm formation were measured. nine luxr and no luxi orthologues were found. c6-hsl and supernatants from yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa caused a significant (1) reduction in cellular density and (2) increases in expression of four putative luxr genes, bmeb3, bmeb6, bmeb7, and bmeb10, resistance to various antibiotics, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (cccp, an uncoupler that dissipates the transmembrane proton gradient, which is also the driving force of resistance nodulation division efflux pumps) and (3) increase in biofilm formation. susceptibility of atcc25285 to c6-hsl was also reduced by cccp. these data suggest that (1) b. fragilis contains putative luxr orthologues, which could respond to exogenous homoserine lactones and modulate biofilm formation, bmeb efflux pump expression, and susceptibility to antibiotics, and (2) bmeb efflux pumps could transport homoserine lactones.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == high proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (uc) remains unknown. it is thought to be  due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. the aim of this study was to investigate the colonic  microbiota of a patient with uc. the colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from uc. the microbiota on the colonic samples  was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna genes. compared with  healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the  uc patient. we found a high incidence of enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "butyrate-producing bacterium" l2-6. furthermore, there was a substantial presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of uc. the high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with  more normal situations. even if those bacteria are not the cause of the uc, they  most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.

TI  == non-enterobacterial endotoxins stimulate human coronary artery but not venous endothelial cell activation via toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == objective: to determine whether non-enterobacterial endotoxins, which are likely  to constitute the majority of the circulating endotoxin pool, may stimulate coronary artery endothelial cell activation. methods and results: interleukin-8 secretion, monocyte adhesion, and e-selectin expression were measured in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) and coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaecs) challenged in vitro with highly purified endotoxins of common host colonisers escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. hcaecs but not huvecs expressed toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and were responsive to non-enterobacterial endotoxins. transfection of tlr-deficient hek-293 cells with tlr2 or tlr4/md2 revealed that while e. coli endotoxin utilised solely tlr4 to signal, the endotoxins, deglycosylated endotoxins (lipid-a), and whole heat-killed bacteria of the other species stimulated tlr2-but not tlr4-dependent cell-signalling. blockade of tlr2 with neutralizing antibody prevented hcaec activation by non-enterobacterial endotoxins. comparison of each endotoxin with e. coli endotoxin in limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that the non-enterobacterial endotoxins are greatly underestimated by this assay, which has been used in all previous studies to estimate plasma endotoxin concentrations. conclusion: circulating non-enterobacterial endotoxins may be an underestimated contributor to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis in individuals at risk of increased plasma endotoxin burden.

TI  == bacteroides species produce vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  == quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. some specific clues led us to hypothesize that bacteroides  species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. first, bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial  infections. these infections often involve pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the bacteroides genus. these and other evidences prompted us to investigate if bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a vibrio harveyi reporter system. in this paper, we show that supernatants of b.  fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the v. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. we could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxs gene of escherichia coli. altogether, our results show that b. fragilis, b. vulgatus and b. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce v. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. however, the role of such molecules in the biology of these  organisms remains unknown.

AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003  and march 2004].
AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2003 to march 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and aerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. among anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate  of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant mrsa. carbapenm-resistant p. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant e. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant e. coli in this year. in the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.

TI  == nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses alginate in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis and in a mouse model.
AB  == background: in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), lung infection with mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa strains overexpressing the exopolysaccaride alginate is preceded by colonization with nonmucoid strains. we investigated the kinetics, impact of environmental signals, and genetics of p. aeruginosa alginate expression in a mouse model and in patients with cf. methods: using indirect immunofluorescence, microarray technology and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we assessed alginate gene expression during aerobic and anaerobic growth of the nonmucoid strain pao1 in vitro, in a mouse lung-infection model and in sputum specimens from patients with cf infected with  nonmucoid or mucoid p. aeruginosa strains. results: anaerobic conditions increased the transcription of alginate genes in vitro and in murine lungs within 24 h. alginate production by pao1 in murine lungs and by nonmucoid p. aeruginosa  strains in patients with cf was reversible after in vitro culture under aerobic conditions. a subpopulation of p. aeruginosa clones revealing stable alginate production was detected in murine lungs 2 weeks after infection. conclusions: anaerobiosis and lung infection rapidly induce alginate production by gene regulation in nonmucoid p. aeruginosa. this trait may contribute to early persistence, leading to chronic p. aeruginosa infection once stable mucoid strains are generated.

TI  == sixteen homologs of the mex-type multidrug resistance efflux pump in bacteroides  fragilis.
AB  == sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) family were found in the bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. disruption mutants were made to the mexb homologs of the four genes most similar to pseudomonas aeruginosa mexb.  reverse transcription-pcr was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmea (the mexa homolog). one of these disruption mutants (in bmeb, the mexb homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. the gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmea, were cloned in a hypersensitive escherichia coli host. the resultant transformants carrying b. fragilis bmeab were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower mics for the b. fragilis bmeb disruption mutants than for the parental strain. the putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmea, bmeb, and bmec (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with oprm). addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and phe-arg beta-naphthylamide (mc-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for rnd pumps in p. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered mics in the parental strain but not in the bmeb disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeb pump is affected by these inhibitors. this is the first description of rnd type pumps in the genus bacteroides.

TI  == bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  == aims: the polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. in addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is  assessed. methods: this is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in adan teaching hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. the patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. the specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. result: staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of  cases. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and proteus mirabilis  (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly bacteroides fragilis. imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive  organisms. conclusion: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. these wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.

AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == drug susceptibility of isolates from severe postoperative intraperitoneal infections causing multiple organ failure.
AB  == purpose: to select the most appropriate antibiotic regimens for life-threatening  postoperative infections, we obtained isolates from patients with severe postoperative infections over a 12-year-period, and examined their drug susceptibility. methods: the subjects of this study were 55 patients with multiple organ failure (mof) caused by postoperative infection. results: all strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were susceptible to vancomycin (vcm) and teicoplanin (teic). only 0.3% of all the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm), but 53.6% of the strains from the severe infections were resistant to ipm. on the other hand, there were few p. aeruginosa strains resistant to meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz), ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and pazufloxacin (pzfx), even among strains isolated from severe infections. the resistant rate of bacteroides fragilis to clindamycin (cldm) was 35.9%, but there were strains resistant to ipm and panipenem. conclusion: these findings suggest that vcm or teic are most appropriate for severe abdominal abscess caused by mrsa, whereas mepm, caz, cpfx, and pzfx are more effective against p. aeruginosa infections. the only antibiotic effective against b. fragilis infections in this study was ipm.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success  and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of the bact/alert fn and the standard anaerobic sn blood culture medium.
AB  == to determine the optimal anaerobic companion bottle to pair with the bact/alert (biomerieux, durham, n.c.) nonvented aerobic fa (fa) medium for recovery of pathogenic microorganisms from adult patients with bacteremia and fungemia, we compared the bact/alert fn (fn) anaerobic bottle with the standard bact/alert sn  (sn) anaerobic bottle. each bottle, fa, fn, and sn, was filled with 8 to 12 ml of blood. of 11,498 blood culture sets received in the clinical microbiology laboratories at two university medical centers, 7,945 sets had all three bottles  filled adequately and 8,569 had both anaerobic bottles filled adequately. of 686  clinically important (based on previously published criteria) isolates detected in one or both adequately filled anaerobic bottles, more staphylococci (p < 0.001), including staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001); members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001); and all microorganisms combined (p < 0.001) were  detected in fn bottles. in contrast, more pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (p < 0.01) and yeasts (p < 0.001) were detected in sn bottles. more bacteroides fragilis group bacteremias were detected only in the fn (six) than in the sn (one) anaerobic bottle (p = not significant). overall, the mean time to detection was shorter with fn (16.8 h) than with sn (18.2 h). this difference in time to detection was greatest for the b. fragilis group: fn, 28 h, versus sn, 60.0 h. many of the facultative microorganisms recovered in either fn or sn were also found in the companion fa. when microorganisms found in the companion fa bottle were omitted from the analysis, significantly more staphylococci (p < 0.001), including s. aureus (p < 0.001), and enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.005) still were detected in fn bottles, whereas there were no significant differences for p. aeruginosa and yeasts, which were found as expected in fa bottles. we conclude that the companion anaerobic fn bottle detects more microorganisms than does the  anaerobic sn bottle when used in conjunction with the nonvented aerobic fa bottle in the bact/alert blood culture system.

TI  == surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  == surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. one hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. the number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). the aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. common microorganisms isolated in our study were e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. the most effective antibiotics for s. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). for gram-negatives (klebsiella spp., e. coli and proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime,  ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). the greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in p. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by klebsiella spp. (33.3%), proteus spp. (33.3%), e. coli (22.2%), and s. aureus (12.5%). all the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical  infections.

AB  == recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) is critical in the host defence against gram-negative infection. while enterobacterial lps signals via toll-like  receptor 4 (tlr4), it has recently been reported that the lps of leptospira interrogans, legionella pneumophila, rhizobium species sin-1 and at least one strain of porphyromonas gingivalis are capable of signalling via tlr2. using a tlr transfection assay and measurement of an nf-kappab-sensitive promoter region, the results show that the lps of bacteroides fragilis nctc-9343, chlamydia trachomatis lgv-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pac-611 also signal via tlr2 and it  is pointed out that all tlr2-signalling lps discovered to date demonstrate relatively weak endotoxicity in some models and structural features distinct from those lps shown to signal via tlr4.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against anaerobes isolated from the respiratory tract.
AB  == ertapenem is a novel parenteral carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its spectrum of activity is similar to that of imipenem and meropenem against gram-positive bacteria, enterobacteriaceae and fastidious gram-negative bacteria  but it is less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. several studies were performed in the united states but only one european study has shown that ertapenem has an excellent activity against anaerobes. the objectives of the present study were to test the activity of ertapenem against anaerobes isolated prospectively from the lower and upper respiratory tracts, and to compare their susceptibility with that of anaerobic isolates from other body sites. fifty-three isolates from the respiratory tract, as well as 50 isolates from various other body sites were tested with e-tests against six antibiotics. for respiratory isolates and for isolates from other sites, mic 90 values (mg/l)  were, respectively, >32 and >32 for penicillin, 0.38 and 0.75 for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 48 and >256 for ceftriaxone, 0.12 and 0.75 for ertapenem, 12 and >256 for clindamycin and 2 and 12 for moxifloxacin. the higher  susceptibility of respiratory tract isolates was mainly due to the different distribution of isolated species: only three respiratory isolates but 22 other isolates belonged to the bacteroides fragilis group. this study confirms the excellent anti-anaerobic activity of ertapenem against anaerobic isolates from the respiratory tract.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == bacterial reduction by cell salvage washing and leukocyte depletion filtration.
AB  == background: blood conservation techniques are being increasingly used because of  the increased cost and lack of availability of allogeneic blood. cell salvage offers great blood savings opportunities but is thought to be contraindicated in  a number of areas (e.g., blood contaminated with bacteria). several outcome studies have suggested the safety of this technique in trauma and colorectal surgery, but many practitioners are still hesitant to apply cell salvage in the face of frank bacterial contamination. this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of bacterial removal when cell salvage was combined with leukocyte depletion filtration. methods: expired packed erythrocytes were obtained and inoculated with a fixed amount of a stock bacteria (escherichia coli american type culture collections [atcc] 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, or bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) in amounts  ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 colony forming units/ml. the blood was processed via  a cell salvage machine. the washed blood was then filtered using a leukocyte reduction filter. the results for blood taken during each step of processing were compared using a repeated-measures design. results: fifteen units of blood were contaminated with each of the stock bacteria. from the prewash sample to the postfiltration sample, 99.0%, 99.6%, 100%, and 97.6% of e. coli, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and b. fragilis were removed, respectively. discussion: significant but not complete removal of contaminating bacteria was seen. an increased level of patient safety may be added to cell salvage by including a leukocyte depletion filter when salvaging blood that might be grossly contaminated with bacteria.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == monocytes heterozygous for the asp299gly and thr399ile mutations in the toll-like receptor 4 gene show no deficit in lipopolysaccharide signalling.
AB  == toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-mediated recognition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) is required for efficient recognition of gram-negative bacterial infections. two commonly occurring mutations in the human tlr4 gene (asp299gly and thr399ile) have recently been shown to be associated with blunted physiological responses to inhaled lps, and with increased risk of gram-negative bacteraemia in sepsis patients and reduced risk of atherosclerosis in an italian population. here we show that monocytes from individuals heterozygous for both mutations in the tlr4  gene exhibit no deficit in recognition of lps of escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, yersinia pestis, chlamydia trachomatis, porphyromonas gingivalis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. we propose that the relatively high frequency of these mutations in the caucasian population may reflect modified responses of carriers to alternative tlr4 agonists.

TI  == zinc-bound thiolate-disulfide exchange: a strategy for inhibiting metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == the mononuclear zinc thiolate complexes [(tp(phme))zn(s-r)], where tp(phme) is hydrotris((3-methyl-5-phenyl)pyrazolyl)borate and (s-r) is benzyl thiolate, 4-nitrophenylthiolate, 4-trifluoromethylphenylthiolate, 4-chlorophenylthiolate, phenylthiolate, 2-methylphenylthiolate, 4-methylphenylthiolate, 4-methoxyphenylthiolate, or 4-hydroxyphenylthiolate, were synthesized. representative members of the class were also characterized structurally. the benzyl thiolate complex undergoes a thiolate-disulfide exchange reaction with a variety of diphenyl and dipyridyl disulfides. kinetic studies revealed that the reaction shows saturation behavior in both complex and disulfide for most of the  disulfides studied. combined with studies of the lability of the coordinated thiolate, a mechanism is proposed where the reactive species is the zinc-coordinated thiolate. when the free benzyl thiol was allowed to react with the same disulfides, the reaction was slower by a factor of 20-200 than that for  the zinc-thiolate complex, depending on the particular disulfide employed. since  most metallo-beta-lactamases contain one or more cysteine residues, the one in the active site being coordinated to zinc, the present study was extended to examine whether disulfides can be used as inhibitors of these enzymes by selective oxidation of the metal-bound cysteine. several disulfides allowed to react with metallo-beta-lactamase ccra from bacteroides fragilis were moderate to potent irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == the role of quinolones in abdominal surgery.
AB  == the quinolone antibiotics have been a major advance for the treatment of various  types of infections. these agents have generally good safety profiles, broad-spectrum activity, and favorable pharmacokinetics. in addition, several of  these antibiotics are available in both intravenous and oral formulations, which  allows for sequential therapy resulting in potential cost savings. however, patients can develop serious central nervous system side effects (seizures) and phototoxicity. in addition, the bioavailability of agents in this class can be reduced by coadministration with cations, such as magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and iron, which may make bioavailability unpredictable in patients. although older quinolones such as ciprofloxacin were effective as prophylactic agents for  biliary procedures and colorectal surgery and for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, the use of these older quinolones was limited by the  development of resistant organisms. in addition, because these agents had poor activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis, the agents had to be combined with an antianaerobic agent, such as metronidazole, when anaerobic coverage was required. recently, a new quinolone, trovafloxacin, has become available. trovafloxacin has demonstrated increased activity against anaerobes in animal and human studies. however, the clinical profile of trovafloxacin for abdominal infections has not been fully demonstrated, and there is some concern that its activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, especially pseudomonas aeruginosa, may not equal that of ciprofloxacin. moreover, the safety profile of  trovafloxacin is disadvantageous owing to reports of severe hepatic toxicity.

TI  == thiols as classical and slow-binding inhibitors of imp-1 and other binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of a variety of thiol compounds on the function of binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases, with a particular focus on imp-1 from pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been investigated. thiol inhibitors, depending on their structural features, fall into two categories, one in which inhibition at neutral ph was instantaneous and the other in which inhibition was time-dependent. while mercaptans with anionic substituents in the vicinity of their sh groups exhibited the former type of inhibition, neutral thiols appear to induce a slow, time-dependent isomerization of the initially formed ei complex to a tighter ei complex. kinetic parameters describing the latter process were obtained by fitting progress curves of substrate hydrolysis using standard and numerical procedures. the failure of charged thiols to exhibit slow binding is suggested to be due to a rapid isomerization of the initial ei complex. slow binding in the case of neutral thiols was observed only below ph 8. studies on the ph dependence of catalysis by imp-1 revealed that (i) enzyme inactivation at  low ph is a slow process with presumably two groups with a pk(a) of approximately 5.2 in the protein being responsible for the loss of activity, (ii) inhibition by thiols is independent of ph between ph 5 and 9, and (iii) an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of imp-1 by thiols occurs at ph <5. the last mentioned  phenomenon is explained by a model in which mercaptans retard the proton-dependent isomerization of the enzyme. studies on the thiol-mediated inhibition of the binuclear forms of bacteroides fragilis (ccra) and bacillus cereus (bcii strain 5/b/6) metallo-beta-lactamase have revealed that while ccra was instantaneously albeit moderately inhibited by mercaptans, bcii mimicked imp-1 in its interaction with thiols. these differences are proposed to be due partly to the structural divergence of these proteins in the vicinity of zn2.

TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.

TI  == changes in the intestinal flora after the administration of prophylactic antibiotics to patients undergoing a gastrectomy.
AB  == purpose: changes in the intestinal flora were investigated in patients administered antibiotics for 4 days after a gastrectomy. methods: twenty-four patients were divided into each of the following groups: cefazolin, 1 g every 8 h; cefozopran, 0.5 g every 8 h; flomoxef, 1 g every 8 h. all drugs were administered intravenously for a 4-day period. results: antibiotic prophylaxis caused no major change in the total number of anaerobes because of the preservation of the bacteroides fragilis group. however, the number of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and veillonella spp. decreased by an average of 100-fold. these changes were accompanied by an overgrowth of enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusions: four days of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery caused a suppression of colonization resistance in the intestinal flora. certain genera of anaerobes may thus play an  important role in preventing overgrowth of antibiotic-resistant organisms after surgery. surgeons should decide the duration of antibiotic use after carefully considering its influence on the intestinal flora.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == this work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. natural product screening of the bacillus cereus ii enzyme identified an extract from a strain of chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. sb236050, sb238569, and sb236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. the most active of these compounds was  sb238569, which possessed k(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microm for the bacillus  cereus ii, pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1, and bacteroides fragilis cfia metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microm). the lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. the crystal structure of sb236050 complexed in the active site of cfia has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 a. sb236050 exhibits key polar interactions with lys184, asn193, and his162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. sb236050 and sb238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. eight micrograms of sb236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the mic of meropenem for two clinical isolates of b. fragilis producing cfia, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == the biological activity of a liposomal complete core lipopolysaccharide vaccine.
AB  == a vaccine that induces humoral immunity to lipopolysaccharide (lps), while remaining non-pyrogenic should be beneficial, as high levels of antibodies against lps are associated with a reduced risk of adverse outcome. however, pure  lps or bacteria expressing lps are generally considered too toxic to be used as vaccines. recently, a novel, immunogenic complete core lipopolysaccharide vaccine has been described, which has been designed to prevent endotoxin-related inflammatory reactions in surgical and high-risk hospitalized patients. in vivo studies have shown that while administration of the vaccine to rabbits results in no toxicity over 7 days, it does induce significantly enhanced antibody responses towards a broad range of clinically relevant gram-negative lpss. here we show that encapsulation of the four complete core lps types escherichia coli k12, escherichia coli r1, bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa into liposomes greatly reduces the ability of a given amount of lps to induce tnf-alpha production in vitro from human monocytes. in contrast to previous studies of liposomal lps, we demonstrate a reduction in activity of approximately 100,000-fold; a reduction approximately 100-1,000-fold more than that previously  described. the signalling by the liposomal lps appears to be entirely dependent on serum factors, though this can be partially restored by soluble cd14 or, to a  lesser extent, by lipopolysaccharide binding protein. time-course experiments reveal that liposomal lps signalling shows similar kinetics to pure lps signalling. therefore, as well as inducing specific antibody responses, liposomal lps demonstrates characteristics suitable for use as a vaccine to be used in human beings.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == functional control of the binuclear metal site in the metallo-beta-lactamase-like fold by subtle amino acid replacements.
AB  == at present there are three protein families that share a common structural domain, the alphabeta/betaalpha fold of class b beta-lactamases: zinc beta-lactamases, glyoxalases ii, and a-type flavoproteins. a detailed inspection  of their superimposed structures was undertaken and showed that although these proteins contain binuclear metal sites in spatially equivalent positions, there are some subtle differences within the first ligand sphere that determine a distinct composition of metals. although zinc beta-lactamases contain either a mono or a di-zinc center, the catalytically active form of glyoxalase ii contains a mixed iron-zinc binuclear center, whereas a-type flavoproteins contain a di-iron site. these variations on the type of metal site found within a common fold are correlated with the subtle variations in the nature of the ligating amino acid residues and are discussed in terms of the different reactions catalyzed by each of the protein families. correlation of these observations with sequence data results in the definition of a sequence motif that comprises the possible binuclear metal site ligands in this broad family. the evolution of the  proteins sharing this common fold and factors modulating reactivity are also discussed.

TI  == a critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli and improved gram-positive activity (e.g. against streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. all  of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration.  clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the qtc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. the remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. these agents may result  in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

AB  == after chemical modification preceded by the random screening of our chemical library, a novel class of selective anti-helicobacter pylori agents was generated. consequently, the 3-(arylacetylamino)-n-methylbenzamides, which were quite easy to prepare, showed potent inhibitory activity against helicobacter pylori but exhibited no inhibitory activity against other sorts of bacteria and fungi, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. these compounds showed potent anti-h. pylori activity under acidic conditions, whereas  amoxicillin and clarithromycin decreased activity. the 3-(3-arylpropionylamino)-n-methylbenzamides, 3-(aryloxyacetylamino)-n-methylbenzamides, and (3-methylcarbamoylphenyl)carbamic  acid 1-arylmethyl esters also exhibited potent anti-h. pylori activity. finally,  we selected 7n (bas-118) as a candidate compound for further evaluation.

TI  == bacteriology of diabetic foot.
AB  == objectives: to study the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from diabetic foot infections and assess their comparative in vitro susceptibility to  the commonly used antibacterial agents. methods: this is a retrospective study with a review of the bacteriology results of specimens taken from 111 consecutive patients with diabetic foot infections at king abdulaziz university hospital, jeddah, kingdom of saudi arabia, during the period january 1997 to june 1999. the specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic techniques. antimicrobial susceptibility testing to different agents, was carried out using the disc diffusion method. results: staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate being recovered from 28% of cases, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in 9 of 30 (30%) patient wounds. the other organisms isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (11%) mainly bacteroides fragilis. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, showed that vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive and and imipenem was the most effective against gram-negative organisms. conclusion: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and bacteroides fragilis were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. these wounds require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial patient management prior to susceptibility results.

TI  == analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  == a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)  was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air  bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain  and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high  air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms.  hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == carbapenemases: a problem in waiting?
AB  == carbapenems are stable to most prevalent beta-lactamases, and chromosomal carbapenemases are restricted to stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to a few bacteroides fragilis, and to rare pathogens. nevertheless, an acquired metallo-beta-lactamase called imp-1 is beginning to emerge in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae isolates in japan, and has also been found in isolates from singapore. furthermore, imp-producing acinetobacter spp. have been  identified in italy and hong kong. recently a second group of acquired metallo-carbapenemases, the vim types, has been recorded from p. aeruginosa isolates in five eurasian countries. weak carbapenemases belonging to molecular class d are emerging in a. baumannii world-wide, with two sub-groups apparent. a  few acquired carbapenemases belonging to molecular class a also have been reported. finally it has also been shown that enzymes with feeble carbapenemase activity (e.g. ampc types and some shv enzymes) may confer resistance in exceptionally impermeable strains; counterwise, even potent carbapenemases, such  as imp-1, may only give a small reduction in susceptibility in enterobacteriaceae that lack permeability lesions. is the emergence of carbapenemase a problem waiting to happen?

AB  == our objective is to develop a prophylactic vaccine strategy that can be evaluated for surgical and other high-risk hospitalized patients. in this paper, we describe the preparation and preclinical evaluation of a liposomal complete-core  lipopolysaccharide (lps) vaccine that is nontoxic and broadly antigenic. complete-core (ra-chemotype) lpss were isolated from four gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli k-12, e. coli r1, pseudomonas aeruginosa pac608, and bacteroides fragilis), mixed together to form a cocktail of complete-core lpss, and then incorporated into multilamellar liposomes consisting of dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol in a 4:1:4 molar ratio. the endotoxic activities of these lps-containing liposomes were less than 0.1% of the endotoxicities of the original free lpss as measured by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. in vivo administration of liposomal complete-core lps mixed with al(oh)(3) to rabbits resulted in no pyrogenicity or  overt toxicity over a 7-day period. in immunoblots, sera from rabbits following active immunization elicited cross-reactive antibodies to a large panel of rough  and smooth lpss from numerous clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria, including e. coli (serotypes o1, o4, o6, o8, o12, o15, o18, o75, o86, o157, and o111), p. aeruginosa (fisher-devlin serotypes 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to international antigenic typing scheme types 6, 11, and 2, respectively), klebsiella pneumoniae (serotypes o1, o2ab, and o3), b. fragilis, and bacteroides  vulgatus. active immunization of mice with liposomal complete-core lps provided protection against a lethal challenge with e. coli o18 lps. the vaccine tested was nontoxic, nonpyrogenic, and immunogenic against a wide variety of pathogens found in clinical settings.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

AB  == escherichia coli r170, isolated from the urine of an infected patient, was resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin but was susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, and imipenem. this particular strain contained three different plasmids that encoded two beta-lactamases with pis of 7.0 and 9.0. resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was transferred by conjugation from e. coli r170 to e. coli j53-2. the transferred plasmid, rza92, which encoded a single beta-lactamase, was 150 kb in length. the cefotaxime resistance gene that  encodes the tla-1 beta-lactamase (pi 9.0) was cloned from the transconjugant by transformation to e. coli dh5alpha. sequencing of the bla(tla-1) gene revealed an open reading frame of 906 bp, which corresponded to 301 amino acid residues, including motifs common to class a beta-lactamases: (70)sxxk, (130)sdn, and (234)ktg. the amino acid sequence of tla-1 shared 50% identity with the cme-1 chromosomal class a beta-lactamase from chryseobacterium (flavobacterium) meningosepticum; 48.8% identity with the veb-1 class a beta-lactamase from e. coli; 40 to 42% identity with cbla of bacteroides uniformis, per-1 of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and per-2 of salmonella typhimurium; and 39% identity with cepa of bacteroides fragilis. the partially purified tla-1 beta-lactamase had a molecular mass of 31.4 kda and a pi of 9.0 and preferentially hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cephalothin, benzylpenicillin, and ceftazidime. the enzyme was markedly inhibited by sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid. tla-1 is a new  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of ambler class a.

TI  == characterization of vim-2, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase and its plasmid- and integron-borne gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate in france.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa col-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in marseilles, france, in 1996. this strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but  remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of p. aeruginosa col-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli dh10b. the deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an ambler class b beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with b-ii from bacillus cereus; 31% with imp-1 from several gram-negative rods in japan, including p. aeruginosa; 27% with ccra from bacteroides fragilis; 24% with blab from chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with ind-1 from chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with cpha-1 from aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with l-1 from stenotrophomonas maltophilia. it was most closely related to vim-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from italian p. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). purified vim-2 beta-lactamase had a pi of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kda, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins,  cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. as a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by edta (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microm). vim-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in e. coli dh10b that paralleled its in vitro  hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(vim-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in  addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from p. aeruginosa to e. coli or from e. coli to e. coli. bla(vim-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, in56, that was weakly related to the bla(vim-1)-containing integron. vim-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a p.  aeruginosa isolate outside japan.

TI  == fourth generation cephalosporins in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of surgical infections.
AB  == surgical infections include a variety of entities such as secondary peritonitis,  intra-abdominal abscesses, obstetric and gynecological infections as well as bone-joint and soft-tissue infections. by definition the term "surgical infection" implies that surgery itself plays the major role in therapy, while antimicrobial chemotherapy is only supplementary. broad-spectrum empirical regimens employed include the combination of a 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporin plus clindamycin or metronidazole +/- aminoglycoside (depending on  the severity of the condition). cefepime and cefpirome are new 4th generation parenteral cephalosporins with a spectrum of activity which makes them suitable for the treatment of infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria. they are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa with activity comparable to or greater than that of cefotaxime or ceftazidime respectively. cefepime in particular is also very active against strains of enterobacter and pseudomonas spp resistant to these two agents. in comparison with 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefepime appears to be less likely to induce resistance, due to a lower rate of hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, a low affinity for these enzymes and more rapid permeation into the cell. despite the fact that a 4th generation cephalosporin is well-suited for the treatment of polymicrobial infections, the following should be kept in mind: (i) mrsa strains and bacteroides fragilis group are not included in their spectrum of activity. (ii) cefpirome is the only cephalosporin with in vitro activity against enterococci. (iii) severe surgical infections of nosocomial origin, and particularly in settings where enterobacter  spp predominate, represent the major indication for empirical use of a 4th generation cephalosporin in combination with a nitroimidazole.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of j-111,225, a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem, against transferable imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase producers.
AB  == imp-1 beta-lactamase, a class b zinc metallo-enzyme encoded by the transferable bla(imp) gene, is known to confer high-level resistance to carbapenems as well as to penicillins and cephalosporins. j-111, 225 is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with a structurally unique side chain comprising a trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio moiety at the c2 position. it inhibited 17 serratia marcescens and two pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1-producing clinical isolates at a concentration of 32 mg/l (range 4-32 mg/l). it showed synergy with imipenem against imp-1-producing s. marcescens bb5886 and p. aeruginosa gn17203 with minimal fic indices of 0.38 and 0.5, respectively. j-111,225 was more resistant than imipenem to hydrolysis by class b metallo-beta-lactamases. in kinetic studies, j-111,225 inhibited the imp-i enzyme with a k(i) of 0.18 microm when imipenem was used as a substrate. in contrast, j-111,225 was the substrate for hydrolysis by other class b beta-lactamases such as bacteroides fragilis ccra, stenotrophomonas maltophilia l1 and bacillus cereus type ii enzyme with respective k(m) values of 11, 10 and 148 microm. the greater antibacterial activity of j-111,225 against imp-1-producing bacteria may result from its unique interaction with the beta-lactamase.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains in 1997].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of meropenem (mepm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mepm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates in 1997. the results were as follows; 1. antimicrobial  activities of mepm against gram-positive bacteria were stronger than those of cephems (ceps) and were approximately equal to those of imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm). 2. carbapenems showed strong antimicrobial activities against enterobacteriaceae, glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group that were multiple drug resistant including the third generation ceps. antimicrobial activities of mepm against these organisms were stronger than those of ipm and papm. by comparing antimicrobial activities of mepm against gram-negative bacteria in 1997 with those obtained in 1993, increase of resistance was not observed. 3. mic-ranges of mepm were low against the resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ipm and papm. it was considered that these resistant strains were not expressing oprd products (d2 porin protein), forming main outer membrane porin channels of carbapenems and basic amino acids.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == the in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint  of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered  acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  == research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. the activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between october and  december 1996. the results were as follows: carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against mssa and streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against mrsa. their activities against enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. the carbapenems showed high activities against haemophilis influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. enterobacter cloacae. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group. their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of serratia marcescens were detected. the antibacterial activity of carbapenems against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of caz, and there were some resistant strains.

TI  == cloning and characterization of blavim, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  == production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate vr-143/97)  from an italian inpatient at the verona university hospital (northern italy). the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of vr-143/97, constructed in an escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class b beta-lactamase that was named vim-1. at the sequence level vim-1 was rather divergent from the other class b enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass b1 including the beta-lactamase ii of bacillus cereus (bc-ii), the bacteroides fragilis ccra, the chryseobacterium meningosepticum blab, and the cassette-encoded imp-1 enzymes. among these, vim-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to bc-ii. similarly to blaimp, blavim was also found to be carried on  a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. the blavim-containing integron  was located on the chromosome of p. aeruginosa vr-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation. expression of the integron-borne blavim gene in e. coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the vim-1 enzyme.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide structure influences the macrophage response via cd14-independent and cd14-dependent pathways.
AB  == cd14, a protein expressed on the surface of monocytes and neutrophils, is a major receptor for lipopolysaccharide (lps). studies with normal and cd14-deficient macrophages show that responses to low concentrations of lps require expression of cd14, whereas responses to high concentrations of lps are cd14-independent. since lps isolated from different bacterial species shows structural variability, studies were performed to determine whether differences in lps structure influence cd14-dependent and cd14-independent responses. studies with lps purified from escherichia coli, salmonella abortus subspecies equi, salmonella minnesota, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis,  and rhodobacter sphaeroides show that the strongest cd14-dependent responses require a typical o-antigen, long carbohydrate chains, at least 6 acyl chains in  their lipid a, and 2-phosphorylated kdo moieties; wild-type lps lacking a typical o-antigen and containing short carbohydrate chains and 2-phosphorylated kdo moieties induces the strongest cd14-independent response.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == bacterially preexposed t cells impair bacterial elimination by non-th1/th2 cell mechanisms in a model of intra-abdominal infection.
AB  == background: escherichia coli preexposure in mice results in impaired elimination  of subsequent intra-abdominal infections by a cd+4 t cell-dependent process. certain gram-negative infections have been shown to induce t-helper-(th)2 type cd4+ t-cell differentiation, which correlates with impaired elimination of infection and death. we hypothesized that e coli preexposure impairs subsequent bacterial elimination as a consequence of th2 differentiation and that interleukin-12 (il-12) treatment could reverse this differentiation and minimize  the effects of e coli preexposure. methods: after preexposure to e coli or other  species, balb/c mice or interferon-gamma (inf-gamma)-deficient mice, treated with or without il-12, were given a standard intra-abdominal infection (e coli, bacteroides fragilis, and adjuvant). cohorts were killed for abscess quantification, in vitro t-cell proliferative responsiveness, and cytokine secretory profiles. splenic lymphocytes preexposed in vivo to other types of bacteria were transferred to naive mice before intra-abdominal infection to determine whether preexposure, eliciting the lymphocyte-dependent response, was species specific. results: e coli preexposure alone caused no th1 or th2 shift; increased the proliferative responses of t cells; and, in combination with il-12  therapy, caused markedly decreased il-2 and il-4 responses and an increased ifn-gamma response. il-12 therapy did not change the response to intra-abdominal  infection despite its ability to cause marked th1 polarization. ifn-gamma-deficient mice responded to e coli preexposure no differently than did  wild-type mice. transfer of lymphocytes preexposed to pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and hemolytic e coli but not other types of nosocomial pathogens caused the development of more abscesses just as transfer of e coli preexposed lymphocytes had. conclusions: cd4+ t cells responsive to e coli preexposure regulate subsequent intra-abdominal abscess formation by a mechanism  not explained by the th1/th2 paradigm. preexposure to hemolytic e coli and other  enterobacteriaceae alters responses to intra-abdominal infection.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two multiple-dose regimens of piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h and 4.5 g every 8 h) were evaluated at steady state for 12 healthy adult volunteers. inhibitory and bactericidal activities for the two regimens were determined with five american type culture collection (atcc) organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis). the percentage of  time that plasma concentrations remained above the mic (t > mic) for each organism and dosage regimen was calculated. areas under the inhibitory (auic0-24) and bactericidal activity (aubc0-24) curves were calculated with the trapezoidal  rule by using the reciprocal of the inhibitory and bactericidal titers determined for each dosage regimen. in order to assess the validity of predicted measures of bactericidal (auc0-24/mbc) and inhibitory (auc0-24/mic) activity to determine bacteriological response to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic values were compared with measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. total body clearance values were equivalent for piperacillin (183.96 +/- 22.66 versus 181.72 +/- 19.54 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) and tazobactam (184.71 +/- 19.89 versus 184.87 +/- 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2, p > 0.05) following the administration of the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h dosages, respectively. comparison of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc0-24) for piperacillin (967.74 +/- 135.56 microg x h/ml versus 978.88 +/- 140.96 microg x h/ml) and tazobactam (120.14 +/- 15.78 microg x h/ml versus 120.01 +/- 16.22 microg x h/ml) revealed no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 3.375-g-every-6-h and 4.5-g-every-8-h regimens, respectively. both regimens provided t > mic values of > 60% for all organisms tested. measured values of bactericidal (aubc) and inhibitory (auic) activity were significantly different (p < 0.05) from predicted values (auc0-24/mbc and auc0-24/mic) for all  organisms studied with the exception of the bactericidal activity for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. additionally, atcc organisms possessing the same mics and mbcs exhibited great differences in measured aubc0-24 and auic0-24 values. reasons for this difference may be inherent differences in organism specific susceptibility.

TI  == analysis of 553 episodes of monomicrobial bacteraemia in cancer patients: any association between risk factors and outcome to particular pathogen?
AB  == relationships between aetiology, various risk factors (such as neutropenia, catheter insertion, endoscopy, therapy with corticosteroids, therapeutic use of antimicrobials, antibiotic prophylaxis, source of infection), symptomatology and  outcome were studied in 553 monomicrobial bacteraemic episodes in cancer patients observed within 7 years at the national cancer institute of the slovak republic.  the ratio of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteraemia was 1:1 (43.5% vs 43.8%), and yeasts caused 7.2% of monomicrobial episodes. the highest mortality was associated with pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.2%), non-albicans candida yeasts (25%) and bacteroides fragilis (22.6%). independent risk factors for particular pathogens were investigated by a computerized logistic regression model. the only independent risk factor for staphylococcal and enterococcal bacteraemia was vascular catheter insertion (or = 1.95 and 2.05, ci = 95%, p = 0.035 and 0.044, respectively). however, there were no independent specific risk significant factors for viridans streptococcal bacteraemia and bacteraemia due to enterobacteriaceae or ps. aeruginosa. neutropenia was found to be an independent  predictor for development of acinetobacter spp. bacteraemia (or = 3.84, ci = 95%, p = 0.044). prior therapy with third-generation cephalosporines was a predictive, independent risk factor for the development of fungaemia (or = 1.99, ci = 95%, p  = 0.028) but not of enterococcal bacteraemia. we also did not observe any association between prior therapy with imipenem and stenotrophomonas maltophilia  bacteraemias. multivariate analysis confirmed that fungaemia may be independently associated with higher mortality than bacteraemia caused by enterobacteriaceae and staphylococci. however, the mortality of fungaemia was statistically no different from that of ps. aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas spp. and viridans streptococci bacteraemias.

TI  == the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501  (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.

TI  == comparison of the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == owing to the broad spectrum of activity afforded by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor preparations, these agents are frequently selected as empiric therapy for the treatment of mixed infections such as intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections, either alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover trial comparing the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against microorganisms commonly isolated from mixed infections. subjects received the following regimes: (i) 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h (q6h) (ii) 4.5  g of piperacillin-tazobactam i.v. q8h, (iii) 3.1 g of ticarcillin-clavulanate i.v. q6h, and (iv) 3.0 g of ampicillin-sulbactam i.v. q6h. serum bactericidal titers were determined and used to calculate the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval of each of the regimens against two clinical isolates of bacillus fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the percentage of the dosing interval over  which drug concentrations in serum remained above the mic for each organism was determined and compared with the observed duration of bactericidal activity was noted (r = 0.78; p < 0.001). all of the regimens demonstrated good activity against b. fragilis and e. coli. against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, however,  all of the regimens provided bactericidal activity for less than 50% of the respective dosing intervals. these data suggest that use of shorter dosing intervals or continuous-infusion regimens should be considered in combination with an aminoglycoside to improve the bactericidal profiles of these agents for e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == gram negative sinusitis: a bacteriologic and histologic study in rabbits.
AB  == recent investigations of chronic sinusitis that is "recalcitrant" to traditional  medical and surgical therapy indicate that gram negative bacteria are frequently  involved, most commonly pseudomonas aeruginosa. analysis of infection-induced histopathologic changes in the underlying sinus mucosa may provide important insight into the recalcitrant nature of these infections. therefore, the aim of this investigation is to experimentally induce sinus infection in the rabbit with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium commonly associated with "recalcitrant sinusitis," and evaluate the histopathologic findings. a unilateral maxillary sinusitis was induced in 33 new zealand white rabbits. histologic analysis at 4,  14, 21, and 28 days revealed a moderate inflammation that persisted throughout the study period. initial changes included edema, loss of submucosal glands, and  ulceration. fibroplasia and bone remodeling were evident throughout the study. epithelial plaque formation occurred early in the infection, whereas goblet cell  formation was a later change. experimental sinusitis induced by pseudomonas aeruginosa causes an intense transmucosal injury. the histopathologic injury and  response to pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be more intense than that noted on  previous investigations of experimental sinusitis using other bacteria. the significant histopathologic changes noted could explain the recalcitrant nature of gram negative sinusitis observed clinically in patients.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. design: retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. setting: navy hospital in bethesda, md. results: sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), escherichia coli (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella sp (n =  3). the most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; b fragilis and enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and s aureus and p aeruginosa and citrobacter sp, with burns. conclusion: these data illustrate the  importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone-sulbactam].
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity of cpz-sbt in 1,146 clinical isolates and compared with that of cpz and other antimicrobial agents. cpz-sbt has much better antibacterial activity than cpz against b-lactamase producing organisms. of the 834 gram negative organisms tested, 165 were cpz resistant, but 94 (57.0%) of them were still susceptible to cpz-sbt, cpz-sbt broadens the antibacterial spectrum of cpz, it has good activity against  acinetobacter spp and b fragilis. compared with other antimicrobial agents tested, cpz-sbt is as active as ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, p aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp, but slightly less active  than imipenem. it is as active as imipenem, timentin and metronidazole against b  fragilis and other anaerobes. the results show that cpz-sbt is a new member of the broad spectrum antimicrobial agents. it may become a promising agent for the  treatment of severe infections caused by cefoperazone-resistant gram negative bacilli including p aeruginosa.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group a streptococci (five isolates), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates)  and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were s. aureus. sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. enteric gram-negative  rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. group a streptococci and s. aureus  predominated in finger and hand lesions. bacteroides fragilis group and clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented prevotella sp. and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == in vitro activity of wy-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial wy-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. wy-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. most strains of enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.

TI  == purification and characterization of ferritin from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we purified an iron-containing protein from campylobacter jejuni using ultracentrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. electron microscopy of this  protein revealed circular particles with a diameter of 11.5 nm and a central core with a diameter of 5.5 nm. the protein was composed of a single peptide of 21 kda and did not serologically cross-react with horse spleen ferritin. the uv-visible  spectrum of the protein showed no absorption peaks in the visible region, indicating that little or no heme is bound. the ratio of fe:phosphate of c. jejuni ferritin was 1.5:1. from these morphological and chemical examinations, we concluded that the c. jejuni purified protein is a ferritin of the same class as  that of helicobacter pylori and bacteroides fragilis and differs from the heme-containing bacterioferritin of escherichia coli. the 30 n-terminal amino acids were sequenced and were found to resemble the sequences of other ferritins  strongly (h. pylori ferritin, 73% identity; b. fragilis ferritin, 50% identity; e. coli gene-165 product, 50% identity), and to a lesser degree, bacterioferritins (e. coli bacterioferritin, 26% identity; azotobacter vinelandii, 26% identity; horse spleen ferritin 30% identity). proteins that cross-reacted with antiserum against the ferritin of c. jejuni were found in other campylobacter species and in h. pylori, but not in vibrio, e. coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. design: of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. results: bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64  needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. the microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented.  aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). in total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. the predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. the highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia,  and leg areas. aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp, bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella and porphyromonas sp, and clostridium sp. certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with clostridium sp, prevotella sp, s aureus, and group a streptococci; regional adenopathy with b fragilis group; bulbous lesions with enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group, clostridium sp, and enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with peptostreptococcus sp, b fragilis group and clostridium sp. certain predisposing  conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with clostridium sp; diabetes with bacteroides sp, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus; and burn with pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: these data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.

TI  == parenteral beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations for clinical use.
AB  == beta-lactamase enzymes are commonly produced by staphylococci, the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain anaerobic organisms, such  as bacteroides fragilis. the production of beta lactamases is an important mechanism through which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. the currently marketed beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations include ampicillin-sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate potassium and, more recently, piperacillin-tazobactam. these extended spectrum antibiotic combinations share the ability to inhibit methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, nearly all anaerobic bacteria and many enterobacteriaceae. ticarcillin-clavulanate potassium and piperacillin-tazobactam also have activity against p. aeruginosa. the combination agents are useful in the treatment of moderate to severe infections, particularly when a polymicrobial etiology is suspected or documented.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibacterial activity of the metabolic by-products of a veillonella species and  bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a veillonella species and bacteroides fragilis were isolated from the cecal contents of adult chickens. when growth on an agar medium supplemented with 0.4%  glucose and adjusted to ph 6.5, mixed cultures containing veillonella and b. fragilis inhibited the growth of salmonella typhimurium; salmonella enteritidis,  escherichia coli 0157:h7 and pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the glucose concentration of the agar decreased the inhibitory activity of the mixed culture. mixed cultures grown on agar media supplemented with 0.5% glucose and adjusted to ph 6.5, 7.0 or 7.5 also inhibited the growth of s. typhimurium, s. enteritidis, e. coli 0157:h7 and p. aeruginosa. however, increasing the ph of the agar decreased the inhibitory activity of the mixed culture. pure cultures of veillonella or b. fragilis did not inhibit the growth of s. typhimurium, s. enteritidis, e. coli 0157:h7 or p. aeruginosa on any of the agar supplemented with different concentrations of glucose or on any of the agar adjusted to different ph levels. the inhibitory activity of the mixed culture was correlated  with the concentration of volatile fatty acids that were formed as b. fragilis metabolized glucose to produce succinate and acetate and as the succinate produced by b. fragilis was decarboxylated by veillonella to produce propionate.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == anti-bacteroides lipopolysaccharide igg levels in healthy adults and sepsis patients.
AB  == members of the genus bacteroides greatly outnumber enterobacteria in the human colon and therefore represent a vast potential pool of biologically active lps. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to estimate the distribution of igg levels to lps from b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and to a  mixture of rough lps from three enterobacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa in sera from 641 adult blood donors. by inhibition elisa some cross-reactivity was demonstrated between the different anti-bacteroides lps igg, but with very little between the anti-bacteroides lps igg and the anti-enterobacterial/pseudomonas lps igg. serum igg was measured daily over 5-9 day periods in 12 sepsis patients (6 survivors, 6 non-survivors) and in a healthy individual. in all patients igg levels fluctuated to a greater extent than levels in a healthy subject. variations all followed similar overall trends and indicated that exposure to bacteroides lps had occurred. in 5 out of 6 survivors, igg levels were rising at  the end of the period, while 4 of the 6 non-survivors showed falls, with an exception showing increasing levels to b. fragilis lps. in 5 out of 6 non-survivors, igg levels against b. fragilis lps were substantially higher than  those against the other lpss. in this small sample some trends in antibody kinetics have been recognised which suggest bacteroides lps may be significant in sepsis, and indicate that this study should be extended.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == biochemical comparison of imipenem, meropenem and biapenem: permeability, binding to penicillin-binding proteins, and stability to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases.
AB  == biological activities of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem were compared with respect to permeability into gram-negative bacteria, binding to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), and hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. permeability for the three carbapenems was similar when measured in serratia marcescens s6 producing a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. penetration of the carbapenems was comparable with cephaloridine and faster than piperacillin or the extended spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime. all the carbapenems bound most strongly to pbp 2 of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to pbp 1 of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, biapenem showed strong affinity with pbp 1a of e. coli and pbp 1b of p. aeruginosa. selected serine beta-lactamases, including the extended spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, hydrolyzed these carbapenems at rates < 0.1% that of cephaloridine. metallo-beta-lactamases  hydrolysed the carbapenems at measurable rates, with enzymes from bacteroides fragilis and xanthomonas maltophilia hydrolyzing biapenem at lower vmax values than meropenem or imipenem. in conclusion, all the carbapenems exhibited good rates of penetration, bound strongly to pbps in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and were stable to most group 1 and group 2 serine beta-lactamases, but were hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases.

TI  == cloning and expression of a cloxacillin-hydrolyzing enzyme and a cephalosporinase from aeromonas sobria aer 14m in escherichia coli: requirement for an e. coli chromosomal mutation for efficient expression of the class d enzyme.
AB  == two beta-lactamase genes, asba1 and asbb1, encoding asba1 and asbb1, respectively, have been cloned from aeromonas sobria aer 14m into escherichia coli. asba1 was expressed at low but detectable levels in all e. coli laboratory  cloning strains tested. asbb1 was expressed well in the e. coli cloning strain dh5 alpha. however, no enzyme activity could be detected from the same clone when placed in e. coli mc1061. ampicillin-resistant mutants of e. coli mc1061 were obtained that expressed high levels of enzymatically active asbb1. four independent mutants were examined. all four mutations mapped to one locus, designated blpa (beta-lactamase permissive). the blpa locus was distinct from other known loci that play a role in beta-lactamase expression, i.e., the two loci that affect expression of the bacteroides fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase and the ampc regulatory genes, ampd, ampe, and ampg. sequence analysis of asba1 and asbb1 revealed that asba1 was a class c beta-lactamase most closely related to the pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosomal cephalosporinase and probably represents the common a. sobria cephalosporinase. asbb1 was a class d enzyme most closely related to the oxacillin-hydrolyzing enzyme oxa-1, with 34% amino acid sequence identity. purified asba1 was a typical cephalosporinase with a substrate profile that reflected high rates of hydrolysis of cephaloridine compared with benzylpenicillin. purified asbb1 showed strong penicillinase activity, with hydrolysis rates for carbenicillin and cloxacillin 2 to 2.5 times that for benzylpenicillin. hydrolysis of imipenem was < or = 1% of that for benzylpenicillin. both clavulanic acid and tazobactam strongly inhibited asbb1, while sulbactam inhibited the asbb1 enzyme less effectively. none of the inhibitors worked well against the asba1 enzyme. the chelators edta and 1,10-o-phenanthroline did not affect the activity of either enzyme. a. sobria aer 14m was found to produce both a group 1 cephalosporinase and a novel group 2d cloxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase that has been designated here oxa-12.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial  activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2  mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp.  were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that  of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == a-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. a-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. a-80556 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against  ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, with an mic90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. however, the significance of this activity is not known. a-80556 was slightly less active against escherichia coli (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (mic90 for e. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). a-80556 was slightly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 2.0  micrograms/ml) and more active against acinetobacter spp. (respective mic90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. against bacteroides fragilis, the mic90 of a-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. the in vivo efficacy of a-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.

TI  == origin and impact of plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins was originally highlighted by the emergence of plasmid-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamases deriving by mutation from tem-1, tem-2 and shv type enzymes (class a). the broader spectrum of resistance produced by these enzymes is related to more amino acid substitutions, but susceptibility to seven alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporins and carbapenems was preserved until recently. clavulanate-sensitive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are distributed worldwide, mainly among klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. novel clavulanate-sensitive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases deriving from other class a enzymes (e.g. men-1 from beta la oxy, oxa-11 in pseudomonas aeruginosa from pse-2) have been reported. recently, clavulanate-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (class c) were encountered amongst single isolates, mostly klebsiella pneumoniae. these cephalosporinases or cefamycinases (usually chromosomally mediated) have expanded the spectrum of plasmid-encoded resistance  to include seven alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporins. thus far, only two isolates (1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 bacteroides fragilis), both recovered in japan, with plasmid-mediated resistance to carbapenems have been found.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3.  mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was  almost the same as the results described above.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the new carbapenem biapenem compared to imipenem, meropenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs.
AB  == the in vitro activity of biapenem was compared to that of imipenem, meropenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams. a total of 716 isolates from recent cases of clinical septicemia and an additional 137 stock strains possessing known beta-lactamases or other well-characterized resistance mechanisms were tested. the minimal concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (mic90) of enterobacteriaceae species were for biapenem 0.03 to 1 mg/l and for imipenem 0.25 to 2 mg/l. no member of the enterobacteriaceae was found to be resistant to biapenem. biapenem and meropenem were the most active drugs against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l. biapenem was more active than ceftazidime against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria tested. biapenem was as potent as imipenem against anaerobic bacteria (including bacteroides fragilis), with an mic90 of 0.25 mg/l. high mics of biapenem were demonstrated for xanthomonas maltophilia, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. these species have demonstrated resistance to other carbapenems and to most  of the newer cephalosporins. the results of this study, coupled with previously documented favorable qualities of biapenem, endorse further investigation of this broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for clinical use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. it demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity  than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. it is noteworthy that fk037, on the basis of the mic90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. against p. aeruginosa, fk037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. however,  fk037 exhibited significant activity against citrobacter and enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. fk037 had an  advantage in that its bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa at sub-mics (1/2 or 1/4 the mic) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against mssa, mrsa and p. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. fk037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), 1, 2 and 3 of s. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (i50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. of essential pbps 3, 1a and 1b of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, fk037 inhibited pbp 3 at the lowest i50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and pbps 1a and 1b with i50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. fk037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except ic cephalosporinase from bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. therefore, fk037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the ability of fk037 to penetrate the outer membrane of e. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of pd 131628, the active metabolite of the prodrug pd 131112, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and members of other groups of antimicrobial agents against 701 recent clinical isolates and strains with known  mechanisms of resistance. the mic90s of pd 131628 against the enterobacteriaceae  were between 0.008 and 0.5 mg/l; pd 131628 was one- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these strains and was four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against the gram-positive species tested, pd 131628 was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, inhibiting all strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae with 0.5 mg/l or less. pd 131628 was very active against neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, with mic90s ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/l. organisms with decreased susceptibility to other quinolones had decreased susceptibility to pd 131628, but there was no cross-resistance between this class of antimicrobial and other classes. the protein binding of pd 131628 was at most  25% across a broad range of concentrations. the addition of 70% human serum had little effect on the mics, but caused a two- to eight-fold increase in mbcs.

TI  == beta-lactam enhancement of aminoglycoside activity under conditions of reduced ph and oxygen tension that may exist in infected tissues.
AB  == aminoglycoside activity is suppressed under conditions of low ph and oxygen tension that are likely to occur in infected tissues; the suppressive effects of  these conditions are additive. under aerobic conditions, the mic of amikacin for  10 isolates of escherichia coli was 4.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/ml at ph 7.2 and increased to 40.0 +/- 8.2 micrograms/ml at ph 6.0. under anaerobic conditions, the mic of amikacin for e. coli was 30.0 +/- 1.5 micrograms/ml at ph 7.2 and greater than 50.0 micrograms/ml at ph 6.0. in vitro and in vivo studies of amikacin activity in an acidic and hypoxic milieu containing beta-lactamase demonstrated substantially enhanced bactericidal activity when amikacin and beta-lactams were used together. under conditions of reduced ph and oxygen tension, cefotaxime enhanced [3h]-tobramycin uptake by e. coli 14-fold and [3h]amikacin uptake 7-fold and appeared to overcome the suppressive effect of those conditions on uptake of aminoglycosides by bacteria.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of e1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == e1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was moderately to  highly resistant to e1077, but e1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. against enterococcus faecalis, e1077 was the most active of  the cephalosporins tested (mic90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, e1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the  members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris, for which the mic90s of e1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. for the anaerobes, e1077 was as active against bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. e1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for e1077.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of ro 09-1227, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  == ro 09-1227 is a novel 7-position catechol-substituted parenteral cephalosporin that also has a 3-position radical similar to previously described cephems. the ro 09-1227 spectrum was slightly wider than that of ceftazidime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, principally because of greater activity  against species producing richmond-sykes type i beta-lactamases. ro 09-1227 was also more active than ceftazidime against some strains producing extended-spectrum plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases, such as tem-3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9, shv-2 and -3, and caz-2. most strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp. were also more susceptible to ro  09-1227 than cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. haemophilus  influenzae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.5 micrograms/ml), neisseria  gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.015 micrograms/ml), and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) were also ro 09-1227 susceptible. ro 09-1227 activity  against important gram-positive cocci was most comparable to that of ceftazidime. bacteroides fragilis (mic90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) and the enterococci (mic90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) were resistant to ro 09-1227. these in vitro results indicate that this catechol-substituted cephalosporin may be useful as an empiric agent, especially for some isolates resistant to currently available broad-spectrum cephalosporins.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == antiseptic effectiveness with fibroblast preservation.
AB  == the efficacy of topical antiseptic therapy for wounds and skin ulcers has been shown to be at the expense of fibroblast and leukocyte function and, in general,  wound healing. specifically, continued fibroblast function after exposure to antiseptics has been correlated to the concentration of the antiseptic. at concentrations that preserve fibroblast function, 0.005% sodium hypochlorite, 0.001% providone-iodine, 0.0025% acetic acid, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide were tested for their effectiveness against various clinical isolates. staphylococcus  aureus, escherichia coli, group d enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis were exposed to the antiseptics and plated in a standard microbiological fashion. the cultures showed that sodium hypochlorite inhibited the growth of all the bacteria (p less than 0.001), whereas povidone-iodine reduced the colonies of s. aureus and acetic acid inhibited p. aeruginosa. our study suggests that 0.005% sodium hypochlorite can be used as a debriding and topical antibacterial agent for wounds and skin ulcers without inhibiting fibroblast activity essential to normal wound repair.

TI  == in vitro activity evaluations of cefdinir (fk482, ci-983, and pd134393). a novel  orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  == cefdinir, a so-called third-generation oral cephalosporin was tested in vitro against over 700 pathogens from patients with bacteremia. cefdinir was very active against the enterobacteriaceae with a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic50) value range of less than or equal to 0.03-8 micrograms/ml. the enteric species having the highest mic90s (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were citrobacter freundii, and the enterobacters, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. cefdinir was generally two- to fourfold less active than cefixime, but markedly more potent with a wider spectrum compared with older oral cephalosporins, cefaclor or cefuroxime. in contrast to cefixime,  cefdinir inhibited staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml) and other staphylococci. pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogenic neisseria spp. (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml) were cefdinir susceptible, but pseudomonas aeruginosa, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and bacteroides fragilis gr. strains were resistant. cefdinir was generally bactericidal with a minimal inoculum effect at  10(6) colony-forming units per spot. cefdinir beta-lactamase hydrolysis by some recently described extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases was suspected. cefdinir exhibited a wide, balanced spectrum for an oral cephalosporin indicating possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in respiratory tract, urinary tract, genital and cutaneous infections.

AB  == the transmembrane diffusion of hydrophobic antimicrobial agents, e.g. lincomycin  and clindamycin, was examined in bacteroides fragilis which is sensitive to these agents. the results showed that these agents penetrate efficiently through the outer membrane. cell surface hydrophobicity measured by the partition assay between water and p-xylene revealed that the cell surface of b. fragilis is more  hydrophobic than that of salmonella typhimurium or pseudomonas aeruginosa. furthermore, treatment with low concentrations of surfactant caused cell lysis. these results suggest that the cell surface hydrophobicity in b. fragilis plays an important role in the efficient transmembrane penetration of hydrophobic compounds. this efficiency explains the susceptibility of b. fragilis to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the accuracy of examination of the gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) enteric bacteria, (b) pseudomonas, and (c) bacteroides or haemophilus, was evaluated. randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, ps. aeruginosa, b. fragilis, and h. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. a  gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. the direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. the percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. the assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. to test this hypothesis, we  prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. examination of the gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, h. influenzae, or b. fragilis. electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of ps. aeruginosa. the higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.

TI  == synergy and antagonism of combinations with quinolones.
AB  == combinations of fluoroquinolones with other antimicrobial agents have been extensively investigated. combinations of fluoroquinolones with aminoglycosides,  beta-lactams, imidazoles, macrolides and clindamycin infrequently show synergy against enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive bacteria. these combinations rarely  show antagonism. combinations of rifampin with fluoroquinolones tested against staphylococcus aureus have been reported to show synergy and antagonism, and in vitro results have not correlated with results of animal infection experiments. against pseudomonas aeruginosa combinations of antipseudomonas penicillins or imipenem with fluoroquinolones are synergistic for 20% to 50% of isolates in vitro and also are synergistic in animal models of infection, whereas combinations of aminoglycosides with fluoroquinolones rarely show synergy against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against anaerobic species such as bacteroides fragilis combinations of fluoroquinolones with clindamycin, anti-anaerobic penicillins, cephalosporins or imidazoles are occasionally synergistic but usually indifferent. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin combined with antituberculosis agents have activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria. in general, fluoroquinolones should be combined with other agents not to achieve synergy, which is extremely variable, but to provide activity against bacteria inadequately inhibited by the fluoroquinolones.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == the viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  == in 1988 the university of wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. this solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. in addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. however, there are no data on whether uw solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. we undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in uw solution at extended preservation times. cultures of both aerobic (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 macfarland turbidity standard) in both eurocollins and uw preservation solutions. samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. the organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. the samples were then incubated at 37 degrees c and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. our results showed growth of all organisms except s epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. s epi grew in the eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the uw solution. when the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the uw solution, s epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. these results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in uw solution with extended preservation times. it may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the uw solution and obtain similar results. it is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ljc10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. ljc10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. the mics of this compound for  90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. ljc10,627  inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa at an mic90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. this compound inhibited haemophilus, neisseria, and branhamella species at mic90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. ljc10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at mic90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against bacteroides fragilis at an mic90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. ljc10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type ii. ljc10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase i; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. killing kinetics of this compound for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the mic (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). ljc10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1b(s) of escherichia coli and  pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of staphylococcus  aureus.

TI  == [in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  == imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of  cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem  also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25  to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).

TI  == in vitro evaluation of win 57273, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == win 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone that has an expanded spectrum of activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.008 microgram/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), bacillus spp. (mic90, 0.03 micrograms/ml), listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and bacteroides fragilis group strains (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). like other fluoroquinolone compounds, win 57273 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria strains (100% susceptible), acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible),  and pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). we observed that win 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on win 57273 mics, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference mbc and kill curve analyses. unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, win 57273 had increased activity (three-  to fourfold) at low ph. rates of mutation to win 57273 resistance at eight times  its mic were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). this new  compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. current  status.
AB  == the fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. ninety-five percent of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (mic, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (mic, more than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml). clostridium spp., including clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the mics by one doubling concentration. a modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: mics with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin mics have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. quality control parameters also are summarized.

TI  == effect of the abscess environment on the antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the present studies were conducted to identify factors in human purulent material that might limit or enhance the activity of ciprofloxacin against bacteria causing suppurative infection. ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ampicillin were tested with regard to binding or inactivation by pus. the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were tested against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or staphylococcus aureus in human pus with a  ph of 6.0 incubated at 37 degrees c under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the effect of single or combination drug therapy with 20 mg/kg of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or rifampin given every 12 hours was tested against e. coli or p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic murine abscesses that had been produced by subcutaneous injection of either of those organisms mixed with bacteroides fragilis and autoclaved human stool. antibiotic levels and the number of bacteria surviving in pus were quantitated. therapy of subcutaneous abscesses was delayed  72 hours to test drug efficacy against organisms in well-established infections.  levels of ampicillin, imipenem, or ciprofloxacin were reduced from 10 micrograms/ml to 3.1 +/- 4.0, 2.7 +/- 3, or 5.8 +/- 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, after incubation in eight pus specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees  c. ampicillin levels were reduced to less than 1 microgram/ml in four pus specimens containing beta-lactamase. imipenem levels were undetectable in two specimens and were 0.2 micrograms/ml in one specimen. ciprofloxacin binding to pus supernate or sediment appeared to be explained by its binding to the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) present in pus. activity of 5 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin against four e. coli or k. pneumoniae strains in pus in vitro was greater than that of twofold higher concentrations of imipenem. the bactericidal  activity of ciprofloxacin and imipenem were comparable but substantially reduced  against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in pus. ciprofloxacin alone or regimens combining ciprofloxacin with rifampin or rifampin plus imipenem reduced the number of e. coli in polymicrobic subcutaneous abscesses but had little effect on p. aeruginosa in polymicrobic abscesses. the anaerobic abscess milieu appeared to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin activity in abscess fluid did  not appear to be adversely affected by acid ph, aerobic or anaerobic conditions of incubation, the abscess constituents, or the binding of ciprofloxacin to the dna in pus. ciprofloxacin was bound to dna of bacterial or human origin. binding  by pus was reversible, and binding to dna extracts of pus was blocked by pretreatment of extracts with deoxyribonuclease but not by pretreatment with ribonuclease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, bmy 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. bmy 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin  showed against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. bmy 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. the antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of bmy 40062 were similar to those  of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of  ciprofloxacin. the in vitro activities of bmy 40062 were influenced by ph and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of bmy 40062 against p. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. in mouse protection tests, the efficacy of bmy 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. bmy 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. compared with ofloxacin, bmy 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. bmy 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin  in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ro 23-9424, a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin and desacetylcefotaxime.
AB  == ro 23-9424 is a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240; am-833) and  the cefotaxime metabolite desacetylcefotaxime. its potency was determined against over 1,000 organisms and found to be intermediate between those of the two components. more than 99% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml; its mic for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. staphylococci, streptococci, branhamella catarrhalis, corynebacterium jeikeium, bacillus spp., haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by ro 23-9424. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., and bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to ro 23-9424 (the mic for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). overall, ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on mics at 10(7) cfu/ml,  and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable  form.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [antibiotherapy in biliary surgery. current status].
AB  == without antibiotherapy, biliary surgery is often followed by infectious complications, possibly serious, indeed life-threatening. biliary bacteria do are responsible of these complications; mainly e. coli, streptococcus faecalis (whose pathogenicity is disputed) and klebsiella. bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa are restricted to special circumstances. it is often difficult to presee whether bile is infected: some risk factors were emerged by keighley but their specificity is not excellent; peroperative gram staining got various results according to the studies. some prefer to give a systematic antibiotherapy. preoperative antibiotic treatment should be as short as possible  because it does not sterilize bile, but selects resistant bacteria, which induce  postoperative complications. it must mainly be aimed at preventing infectious scattering. surgery is the main part of the treatment. antibiotic choice has to take into account clinical picture, bacteria (those probably responsible for and  their sensibility) and goal of the treatment (prophylactic or curative). analysis of failures should allow to improve this choice. but only multicenter studies concerning full selected populations of patients are able to prove superiority of one antibiotic to another.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == comparative susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone:  1981 to 1987.
AB  == it has been postulated that the widespread use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins might lead to increased bacterial resistance to such agents. to determine if such increased resistance to cefoperazone might be detectable, the susceptibility patterns of common clinical isolates to cefoperazone were examined from the pathology laboratories at baptist medical center, jacksonville, florida, from 1981, prior to approval by the food and drug administration, to the present. gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, staphylococci, and members of the bacteroides fragilis group were included in the analysis. the data obtained were compared with results of similar published studies nationwide. no significant decrease in susceptibility to cefoperazone was detected for any gram-negative species examined. a steady increase in the percentage of staphylococci (both coagulase positive and especially coagulase negative) resistant to cefoperazone was demonstrable at this institution. this was a direct function of the concomitant rise in the percentages of staphylococci resistant to methicillin observed over the testing interval. anaerobic susceptibility patterns of the members of the b. fragilis group were also relatively constant during this period of time. the concentrations of antibiotic inhibiting 50 percent (mic50) and 90 percent (mic90) of b. fragilis isolates as determined by an agar dilution  technique were 16 micrograms/ml and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, both in 1981  and in 1987. no change in the national susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to cefoperazone was demonstrable in the five-year period during which the antibiotic has been available for clinical use.

AB  == a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci  were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold  dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin  against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.

TI  == comparative antibacterial activity of new quinolone-carboxylic acid derivatives.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of new quinolone-carboxylic acid derivatives are described. a compilation of mics of nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, and seven new quinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin,  pefloxacin, ny-198, and am-833) is presented. the new quinolones exhibit potent antibacterial activity against the enteric gram-negative bacteria. these compounds also are active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive bacteria. mics of these agents for bacteroides fragilis are higher. excellent bactericidal activity of new quinolones, the result of their strongly inhibitory  activity against bacterial dna gyrase, was found to be characteristic. the bioavailabilities of the new quinolones are discussed from the standpoint of their physicochemical properties. the quinolone compounds are classified roughly  into three groups: lipophilic, hydrophilic, and intermediate agents. ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin belong to the hydrophilic group. the intermediate group, which includes ofloxacin, am-833, ny-198, and pefloxacin, achieved higher serum levels after oral administration. thus, the antibacterial activities of these agents in vivo are thought to reflect their antibacterial activities in vitro and their bioavailability.

TI  == in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those  obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.

TI  == treatment of chronic postsurgical osteomyelitis with ciprofloxacin.
AB  == sixteen patients (11f, 5m, age 18-83, mean 59.8 years) with chronic postsurgical  osteomyelitis were treated with ciprofloxacin. the dosage was 500 or 750 mg twice daily orally during one to six months; four patients started with 300 mg twice daily intravenously and changed after 3-7 days to oral therapy. twelve patients had implanted prostheses. the organisms involved were enterobacteriaceae (11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7), staphylococcus aureus (5), streptococcus faecalis (4) and bacteroides fragilis (1). nine patients had pure cultures, seven mixed cultures. cure (disappearance of infection symptoms, return of normal function with negative cultures, without resurgery) was obtained in 11 patients, improvement (resurgery required to obtain complete cure) in two. three patients with infections by staphylococcus aureus (2) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) failed to respond after one and four months treatment respectively. no side effects were observed.

TI  == the in vitro activity of the combination of cefotaxime and hre 664.
AB  == cefotaxime (ctx) and hre 664 (a novel penem antibiotic) possess complementary in  vitro properties. differences can be observed in their antibacterial spectra, their beta-lactamase stability and -inhibition, and their affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. these differences suggested that combinations of the cephalosporin and the penem antibiotic would be advantageous and should be studied. the fractional inhibitory concentration values of checkerboard studies confirmed that ctx and hre 664 act synergistically against various gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. fixed combinations containing 80% ctx and 20% hre 664 possess broader antibacterial spectra and in certain cases higher antibacterial activities than each of the components alone. the combinations had improved activity against staphylococci including methicillin-resistant strains, beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter sp. and bacteroides fragilis. the combination as well as the single antibiotics had only limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == microbiological studies of tracheostomy site wounds.
AB  == specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered  in 19 (76%). a total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). the most frequently recovered isolates were peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. these included all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of bacteroides melaninogenicus group. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.

TI  == antibacterial effect of imipenem in vitro against important aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == imipenem is a thienamycin antibiotic of the first generation with broad antibacterial activity. it covers all gram-positive organisms (including streptococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (including pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp.) as well as bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides species. in this comparative study the antimicrobic effect against 1020 gram-negative, 927 gram-positive and 352 anaerobic strains from fresh clinical isolates was tested and compared with that of other frequently used antibiotics. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by means of a serial dilution test with micro standard plates. within the group of gram-negative strains, imipenem was the most active antibiotic with a mic90 of less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l for most isolates. imipenem shows a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp. and serratia spp., and also covers resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and alcaligenes faecalis. imipenem also shows high inhibiting activity against gram-positive strains and anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-6240, a new difluoroquinolone derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ro 23-6240 is a new difluorinated quinolone antimicrobial agent. its in vitro activity against a wide range of bacteria was compared with those of other quinolones and beta-lactams. generally, members of the family enterobacteriaceae  were inhibited by low concentrations of ro 23-6240 (mic90 [mic for 90% of isolates tested], less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). ninety percent of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) showed intermediate susceptibility, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) was less susceptible. strains resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all the quinolones tested. the protein binding of ro 23-6240  (5 micrograms/ml) was 27%.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == [clinical trials of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

TI  == activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. mic90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. all strains except escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. pefloxacin was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; mic90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other  enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). with bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and b. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l)  gave variable results. amongst genitourinary isolates, neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but gardnerella vaginalis (25) and mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). pefloxacin was  more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. no enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones,  whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

TI  == bactericidal effects of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in vivo.
AB  == the comparative efficacies of ticarcillin and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid have been determined in the mouse against experimental infections caused by ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the infections studied comprised an intraperitoneal infection, local tissue infections, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia. both ticarcillin and clavulanic acid penetrated readily to the sites of infection studied and at the doses employed were present at concentrations of  the same order as those obtained in humans after the administration of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid formulations (timentin; beecham). at these concentrations, the ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination caused significant bactericidal effects at the sites of infection against the ticarcillin-resistant  strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus investigated. the efficacy of ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against the infections resistant to therapy with ticarcillin demonstrated the beta-lactamase-inhibitory activity of clavulanic acid in vivo.

AB  == the therapeutic effects produced by ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid were compared with those of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid separately against infections in the mouse caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. the infections studied included a pneumonia model, a local tissue infection and pyelonephritis. the distribution of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid in infected animals was evaluated by measurement of the concentrations of the substances present at sites of infection. the results showed that both ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were well-distributed in the mouse and at the doses employed were present at the sites of infection at concentrations of the same order as those obtained in man after administration of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid formulations  (timentin). the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by the beta-lactamases produced in vivo by bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was demonstrated by the pronounced bactericidal effects produced by the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against the ticarcillin-refractory infections studied.

TI  == variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. all antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. against the strains of escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. at the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against e. coli and most strains of h. influenzae. antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with bacteroides fragilis. antibiotic resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == aztreonam. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == aztreonam (azthreonam; sq 26,776) is the first member of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the monobactams. aztreonam is selectively active against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and inactive against gram-positive bacteria. thus, in vitro, aztreonam is inhibitory at low concentrations (mic90 less than or equal to 1.6 mg/l) against enterobacteriaceae except enterobacter species, and is active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% of pseudomonads being inhibited by 12  to 32 mg/l. aztreonam is inactive against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis. therefore, when administered alone, aztreonam has minimal effect on indigenous faecal anaerobes. aztreonam must be administered intravenously or intramuscularly when used to treat systemic infections, since absolute bioavailability is very low (about 1%) after oral administration. since elimination half-life is less than 2 hours, 6- or 8-hourly  administration is used in the treatment of moderately severe or severe infections, although 12-hourly injection is adequate in less severe systemic and  some urinary tract infections. therapeutic trials have shown aztreonam to be effective in gram-negative infections including complicated infections of the urinary tract, in lower respiratory tract infections and in gynaecological and obstetric, intra-abdominal, joint and bone, skin and soft tissue infections, uncomplicated gonorrhoea and septicaemia. in comparisons with other antibiotics,  aztreonam has been at least as effective or more effective than cefamandole in urinary tract infections and similar in efficacy to tobramycin or gentamicin. where necessary, aztreonam and the standard drug have both been combined with another antibiotic active against gram-positive and/or anaerobic bacteria. aztreonam has been effective in eradicating pseudomonal infections in most patients (except in patients with cystic fibrosis), but the inevitably limited number of pseudomonal infections available for study prevents any conclusions as  to the relative efficacy of aztreonam compared with other appropriate regimens against these infections. thus, with an antibacterial spectrum which differs from that of other antibiotics, aztreonam should be a useful alternative to aminoglycosides or 'third generation' cephalosporins in patients with proven or suspected serious gram-negative infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

TI  == enhancement of growth of aerobic and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with bacteroides species.
AB  == the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of the bacteroides fragilis and b. melaninogenicus groups and the aerobic and facultative organisms commonly isolated with them in mixed infections was evaluated. enhancement was studied by  measuring the relative increase in cfu of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. of the 42 combinations between three isolates each of the b. fragilis and b. melaninogenicus groups and seven aerobic or facultative organisms, bacteroides spp. were enhanced in only 8 and inhibited in  4. the aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 31 of the 42 combinations and depressed in 2. the organisms uniformly enhanced by all of the bacteroides spp. were group a streptococci and escherichia coli (all six instances), followed by staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae (five of  six instances), pseudomonas aeruginosa (four instances), group d streptococci (in three instances only by the b. fragilis group), and haemophilus influenzae (one instance). it is apparent that the growth rate of facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. than that of their anaerobic counterparts.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == new beta-lactam antibiotics in granulocytopenic patients. new options and new questions.
AB  == infectious complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and, at many centers,  the major cause of death in patients with cancer. the increased risk and severity of infectious sequelae result from profound alterations in normal host defenses that occur secondary to the underlying malignancy and the treatment thereof. during the last decade, early empiric antibiotic therapy has become standard practice in the initial management of febrile granulocytopenic patients and has contributed significantly to the improved outcome among patients undergoing cancer therapy. although early death due to unsuspected or inadequately treated bacterial infection has been largely overcome, new problems--also with life-threatening implications--have emerged. as the use of cancer chemotherapy continues to increase, new populations of patients are being placed at increased  risk of infection. defining the host and environmental factors that contribute to this risk assumes central importance for delineating those patients who require the most intense surveillance. changing medical practices (e.g., increased use of indwelling catheters) have contributed to the emergence of new pathogens. recent  drug developments (e.g., the third-generation cephalosporins and extended-spectrum penicillins) offer new treatment options, as well as generate controversy and confusion. for example, authorities disagree on the optimal duration and modifications in treatment that are required by cancer patients who  remain granulocytopenic and who thus are at continued risk of multiple infectious episodes or superinfections. a question of current interest is whether combination therapy with synergistic agents is important in light of the development of the third-generation cephalosporins and extended-spectrum penicillins. several of these new antibiotics have an exceedingly broad spectrum  of activity that includes pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as enterobacteriaceae,  serratia, citrobacter, indole-positive proteus, and anaerobes (including bacteroides fragilis). however, the third-generation cephalosporins are not as active against staphylococci and streptococci as are the first-generation cephalosporins, and none is effective against enterococci. nonetheless, these agents achieve serum levels that can be 10 to 100 times greater than the minimal  inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of gram-negative bacteria, raising the possibility that these drugs might be effective as single agents. the advantages  of the third-generation cephalosporins are their minimal toxicity and long serum  half-lives.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk0787/mk0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. major pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus species. satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. no major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. the results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  == using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species. unlike many newer beta-lactams, sch 34343 was highly active  against gram-positive species. it was consistently active against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic50 and mic90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). this, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. sch 34343 was the most active compound tested  against bacteroides fragilis. in tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. it had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. it showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at ph values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees c. binding in human plasma was 72%. we concluded  that sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == efficacy of rifampicin in experimental bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa mixed infections.
AB  == experimental intraabdominal abscesses were produced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of rifampicin and cefsulodin alone, and in combination was investigated  in this in-vivo experimental mixed intraabdominal abscess model. treatment with rifampicin at 10, and 25 mg/kg or cefsulodin at 50, and 100 mg/kg singly or in combinations prevented mortality as compared to 68% mortality rate occurring in the untreated mice. rifampicin, at 25 mg/kg dose, was very effective in preventing abscess formation and produced bacterial eradication. it prevented abscess formation in 80% of the mice and eradicated both bacteroides and pseudomonas in 100% and 75% of the abscesses of the mice. cefsulodin failed to reduce the incidence of abscess formation, and to eradicate bact. fragilis from the abscesses, although it significantly decreased ps. aeruginosa in the abscesses. the combination of rifampicin at 10 mg/kg and cefsulodin at 100 mg/kg  was more effective than either of the antibiotics alone and was as effective as rifampicin alone at 25 mg/kg levels. this combination was bactericidal against both organisms in the infected mice.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == ceftizoxime. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == ceftizoxime is a 'third generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. like other third generation cephalosporins it has a wide spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, is particularly active against enterobacteriaceae (including beta-lactamase-positive strains), and is resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. however, the third generation cephalosporins are less active than earlier cephalosporins against staphylococci and so could not be considered  the drugs of choice. like many currently available third generation cephalosporins, ceftizoxime has limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and thus cannot be recommended as sole treatment of known or suspected non-urinary tract pseudomonal infections. similarly, although favourable clinical results have been obtained in patients treated with ceftizoxime for infections caused by mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms (such as intra-abdominal, and obstetric and gynaecological infections), the relatively low in vitro activity of ceftizoxime (in common with most other third generation cephalosporins) against bacteroides fragilis and enterococci may restrict its usage in situations where these organisms are the suspected or proven pathogens. ceftizoxime appears to be  similar in efficacy to several other cephalosporins in lower respiratory tract infections in elderly and/or debilitated patients, and in chronic and/or complicated urinary tract infections, 2 clinical situations in which third generation cephalosporins may have a major role. ceftizoxime is also effective clinically and bacteriologically in skin, soft tissue, bone and joint infections, septicaemia/bacteraemia, meningitis and neonatal infections. however, a few large, well designed clinical comparisons of efficacy with aminoglycosides are needed before ceftizoxime can be recommended as an alternative in patients in whom potential aminoglycoside toxicity is a concern. single intramuscular doses of ceftizoxime appear similar in efficacy to aqueous procaine penicillin g in gonorrhoeae due to nonpenicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoea, and ceftizoxime is also highly effective against penicillinase-producing strains. although only a few infections have been treated to date, ceftizoxime may be useful in the treatment of gonorrhoea in places where penicillinase-producing strains are common. thus, ceftizoxime appears to be an effective addition to the  growing number of third generation cephalosporins. however, further studies are needed to confirm its relative efficacy compared with other new cephalosporins, in particular cefotaxime.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat,  the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates.  an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and  10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at  4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

TI  == cefmenoxime: in vitro activity.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was determined for a broad spectrum of 1,234 organisms  isolated as part of a multiclinic study. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90 percent of strains tested (mic90) ranged from 0.12 to 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacteriaceae. mic90s were 0.015 and 0.06 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, respectively, and 4 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. the mic90 of cefmenoxime for neisseria gonorrhoeae and hemophilus influenzae was 0.06 microgram/ml. cefmenoxime was less active against  pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and bacteroides fragilis (mic50 =  16 micrograms/ml).

TI  == nature and location of amide-bound (r)-3-acyloxyacyl groups in lipid a of lipopolysaccharides from various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == it has previously been demonstrated [eur. j. biochem. 124, 191-198 (1982) and 137, 15-22 (1983)] that the lipid a component of salmonella and proteus lipopolysaccharides contains amide-linked (r)-3-acyloxyacyl residues. in the present study lipid a of other gram-negative bacteria was analysed for the presence of amide-bound 3-acyloxyacyl residues. it was found that such residues are constituents of all lipid a tested (agrobacterium tumefaciens, chromobacterium violaceum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas sinensis, bacteroides fragilis, vibrio cholerae, fusobacterium nucleatum, rhodospirillum tenue, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and escherichia coli). amide-linked (r)-3-acyloxyacyl groups, therefore, represent common and ubiquitous structural elements of bacterial lipid a. the composition of 3-acyloxyacyl groups differed considerably among different bacteria. as amide-bound (r)-3-hydroxy fatty acids straight chain and isobranched acyl groups with 10-17 carbon atoms were identified. the most frequently encountered fatty acids, substituting the 3-hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxy fatty acids, were nonhydroxylated straight chain and isobranched acyl residues with 10-17 carbon atoms as well as (s)-2-hydroxy fatty acids with 12 carbon atoms. in some cases, using laser desorption mass spectrometry, the distribution of 3-acyloxyacyl residues over the two available glucosamine amino groups of the lipid a backbone was investigated.

TI  == imipenem therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa and other serious bacterial infections.
AB  == imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with remarkable and extremely potent in vitro activity against most commonly isolated  bacterial pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and  hemophilus influenzae. the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem were evaluated in 35 patients with 38 different infections. the overall clinical response was favorable (infections cured or improved) in 89% of the infections (34 of 38). of the 17 infections with p. aeruginosa, 15 were cured or improved. however, p. aeruginosa isolates resistant to imipenem emerged during the therapy  of six infections, and two cases of p. aeruginosa septicemia later relapsed after imipenem therapy. gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea with or without emesis) occurred in 17% of the patients (6 of 35) but was ameliorated by slowing the rate of intravenous infusion or lowering the dose of imipenem. except for certain severe p. aeruginosa infections, imipenem is effective and relatively safe therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of brl 36650, a novel 6 alpha-substituted penicillin.
AB  == brl 36650 is a new type of penicillin in which a formamido group has been introduced into the 6 alpha-position of the nucleus. the compound is highly active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and is stable to a wide range of beta-lactamases produced by these organisms. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, brl 36650 was considerably more active than piperacillin, particularly against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and showed a similar level of activity to moxalactam, aztreonam, and the third-generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime. against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas  species, brl 36650 was more active than piperacillin, cefoperazone, and aztreonam and compared favorably with ceftazidime. brl 36650 was highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, and against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. clinical isolates of enterobacter species and p. aeruginosa which showed markedly reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam were only slightly less susceptible to brl 36650. against bacteroides fragilis and most gram-positive bacteria, brl 36650 showed only a low level of activity. brl 36650  was found to be only 35% bound to human serum protein, and the antibacterial activity was little affected by the presence of serum. in contrast, the composition of the test medium influenced the activity of brl 36650 slightly, and an antagonistic effect could be demonstrated between the compound and a component of certain mueller-hinton media.

TI  == piperacillin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties  and therapeutic use.
AB  == piperacillin is one of the new generation of semisynthetic penicillins which can  be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  although piperacillin has shown greater activity against beta-lactamase-producing organisms than the other penicillins, it is hydrolysed by the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem-1). activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is better than that of ticarcillin, carbenicillin and mezlocillin. although only limited controlled studies have been reported, in those which have been conducted and in  a larger number of open studies piperacillin was effective in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, caused by gram-negative bacilli. favourable clinical results have been obtained in patients with infections caused by mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms (such as intra-abdominal infections) but the relatively average in vitro activity of piperacillin against bacteroides fragilis may not indicate its usage in situations where this organism is the suspected or  proven pathogen. piperacillin in combination with an aminoglycoside or a 'third generation' cephalosporin gave encouraging results in the treatment of infections in immunocompromised patients, whilst its penetration into the diseased central nervous system and lack of toxicity indicate a potential value in the treatment of neonatal gram-negative bacillary meningitis, particularly where the causative  organism is pseudomonas aeruginosa. whether piperacillin alone is appropriate therapy for conditions usually treated with aminoglycosides (other than pseudomonal infections) needs additional clarification, but if established as equally effective in such conditions it has the advantages of its apparent lack of serious adverse effects and freedom from the need to undertake plasma concentration monitoring. these advantages would not, however, apply when considering one of the new (third generation) cephalosporins as alternative therapy in non-pseudomonal infections. generally, however, it is still considered necessary to treat serious and complicated infections with combination therapy, either a cephalosporin, or in cases of resistance to p. aeruginosa an aminoglycoside.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone: a review.
AB  == ceftriaxone possesses potent activity, both in vitro and in vivo, against a broad range of bacteria. mic50 and mic90 geometric means were calculated using the results of broth and agar dilution assays performed worldwide. the mic90 for ceftriaxone overall was 8 micrograms/ml or less for enterobacteriaceae and 0.024  microgram/ml or less for neisseria and hemophilus species. moderate activity was  noted against pseudomonas and acinetobacter species (mic50 12 to 28 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was extremely active against nonenterococcal streptococci (mic90 0.07 microgram/ml or less) and quite active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 5 micrograms/ml or less). ceftriaxone generally was inactive against enterococci and methicillin-resistant  staphylococci. activity against anaerobes was good, except for many strains of bacteroides fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron (mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone exhibited excellent stability to beta-lactamases. the effect of medium and inoculum on in vitro testing was minimal. excellent activity was demonstrated in vivo. against enterobacteriaceae, nonenterococcal streptococci, and h. influenzae, the pd50 in mice generally was less than 1 mg/kg. s. aureus strains responded moderately (mean pd50 6.5 mg/kg), whereas against most p. aeruginosa strains, pd50s ranged from 5 to greater than 250 mg/kg. the superior pharmacokinetic profile of ceftriaxone compared with that of other new cephalosporins was demonstrated by use of a prophylactic treatment schedule. the  ability of ceftriaxone to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid and provide excellent therapeutic coverage was confirmed in experimental meningitis models.

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

AB  == the activity of enoxacin against 362 clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. typical mics for enterobacteria lay between 0.12 and 1.0 mg/l. enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. tended to be more resistant. enoxacin was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean mic 0.5 mg/l) and highly active against fastidious gram-negative aerobes. typical mics for staphylococcus aureus were 1-2 mg/l while streptococci were more resistant (16-32 mg/l). enoxacin had no useful activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. enoxacin was generally more active at ph 8  than ph 6, and in broth than in urine. it was bactericidal in its action. daily serial passage from growth in broth containing enoxacin caused decreased sensitivity which was limited to four- to 16-fold greater than the original mic.  enoxacin was about half as active as norfloxacin against enterobacteria, equally  active against staphylococci, and some two to four times less active against streptococci.

TI  == activity of cefotaxime against enterococci.
AB  == the third-generation cephalosporins as a group are characterized by spectra of activity that are the broadest of the currently available antibiotics (farber and moellering, 1982). these agents provide excellent coverage of infections due to enterobacteriaceae. they also exhibit good (but variable) activity against a number of "nonfermentors" such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many of them are likewise active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis (farber and moellering, 1982). as a class, the third generation cephalosporins are less active against gram-positive organisms, but in spite of this they have been clinically effective against infections due to s. aureus and many other gram-positive cocci (saito, 1982). enterococci, however, have proven to be a difficult organism for the third-generation cephalosporins. none of the presently available compounds exhibits very good activity against these organisms in vitro  (fass, 1983). given this fact and the broad spectrum of activity of these compounds against other organisms, there is a significant potential for enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with the third-generation cephalosporins. indeed, serious enterococcal infection has clearly been documented in patients treated with some third-generation cephalosporins (moellering, 1982; yu, 1981). although none of the presently available third-generation cephalosporins exhibits therapeutically useful activity against  enterococci, currently available data suggest that there may be differences among these compounds in their ability to cause (or prevent) this complication. for instance, there are more published reports of enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with moxalactam than in patients receiving the other third-generation cephalosporins.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (ctx) is partially desacetylated in vivo. desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean mics of des-ctx lower than 1 microgram/ml. its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. it was only against some strains of p. cepacia that des-ctx surpassed the activity of ctx. the activity of des-ctx markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. this is especially true for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, most species of enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == ceftizoxime: a beta-lactamase-stable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin. pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and clinical use.
AB  == ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide  variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of streptococcus faecalis. staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. it inhibits pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable  concentrations. ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and  intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. the half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. the compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by  hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea,  including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. no major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

TI  == basic design of beta-lactam antibiotics--cephalosporins.
AB  == since the introduction of cephaloglycin and cephalothin as the first commercially available cephalosporin c derivatives, there has been a proliferation of new agents, predominantly injectables. these have provided compounds with increased potency, improved spectrum, and/or pharmacokinetic advantages. the nature of the  modifications producing these changes is the subject of the present report. the pathway generally followed by chemists working on a nucleus suitable for modification is initially a combination of trial and error and application of analogies from related areas. once a moiety conferring a desirable effect has been identified, it or its analogs will be widely utilized in an effort to achieve further improvements. the choice of derivatives to be made is appreciably influenced by potential patentability and the feasibility of synthesis. for oral  cephalosporins, to achieve adequate intrinsic bioavailability, the 7 beta-side chain has almost invariably been found to require a primary amino group on the alpha-carbon (d-configuration). this has limited potential changes at the 7 beta-position and leaves the 3-position as the major site for introducing novel substituents. among thousands of derivatives prepared, only a few have actually been developed for clinical use. for injectables, where oral absorption is not a  factor, there are no such specific preferred entities for either the 3- or 7 beta-position. because of this, cephalosporin derivatives containing a large and  diverse group of substituents at these positions have been prepared. in addition, another substitution site was identified upon discovery of the cephamycins, antibiotics which differ from cephalosporins by the presence of a methoxy group at the 7 alpha-position. substitution at this site confers remarkable beta-lactamase stability, but only methoxy has given acceptable potency. first generation injectables which have in the 3-position the naturally occurring acetoxymethyl group or other relatively simply substituents are very active against gram-positive organisms and a few species of gram-negatives. as new 3- and 7 beta-side chain moieties were studied, appropriate combinations yielded compounds active vs. a broader spectrum of enterobacteriaceae and/or pseudomonas  aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. furthermore, dramatic changes in pharmacokinetics (longer half-lives) were achieved by both 3- and 7 beta-side chain modifications.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == use of new beta-lactam antibiotics in intraabdominal surgery.
AB  == infections after gastrointestinal surgery may involve both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. although the broadspectrum cephalosporins are active against most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  many of these agents are ineffective against bacteroides fragilis, many clostridia and some strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci. these bacteria are frequently found in intraabdominal infections. a  major reason for this inefficacy is susceptibility to beta-lactamases. the new beta-lactam antibiotics--cephamycins, third generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, acyl ureidopenicillins and monobactams--are all more or less beta-lactamase stable. the beta-lactamase inhibitors combined with a beta-lactam  antibiotic give a broad antibacterial spectrum. most of these compounds are non-toxic or relatively atoxic and, with the exception of the monobactams, they can be used as a monotherapy in many infections derived from the gastrointestinal tract. antibiotic prophylaxis in colorectal surgery offers a clinical model for the study of the benefit and risks of new beta-lactam antibiotics. most infections are derived from the gastrointestinal endogenous microflora. the study of the impact of different antibiotics on the colonic microflora indicates the risk of bacterial resistance, superinfection, antibiotic associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. data obtained from such studies with the new beta-lactam antibiotics are compared to the results from controlled clinical trials with these antibiotics in this review article.

TI  == [chronological variations in blood isolates and their susceptibility to various antibiotics].
AB  == chronological variation in blood isolates obtained from 1968 to 1982 was studied. escherichia coli was the most frequent isolates followed by klebsiella species, glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), enterobacter-serratia group, and staphylococcus aureus. the isolation of glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, about half of which being achromobacter xylosoxidans, increased greatly in number from 1980. a total of 113 strains of blood isolates was examined for susceptibility to various antibiotics. although there was a significant increase in s. aureus resistant to gm, these strains were susceptible to cephalosporins. in the 9 strains of gm-resistant aerobic gram-negative rods (2 strains of klebsiella, 2 strains of enterobacter, 4 strains of serratia and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa), 3 strains of serratia species were also resistant to amk. two strains of lcm-resistant bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to lmox, but 1 strain was not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml of  cfx. among the clinical specimens, differences were found in the rate of isolation of resistant strains, particularly in the case of serratia and p. aeruginosa. antibiotic resistant strains were isolated more frequently from urine and the least frequently from sputum. since the frequency of isolation of resistant strains varied according to organism, clinical material and year of isolation, microbiological laboratories should develop their own data base from which clinicians can make rational therapeutic decisions.

TI  == thienamycin: development of imipenen-cilastatin.
AB  == thienamycin, a natural product produced by streptomyces cattleya is the first representative of a unique class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbapenems. despite its outstanding potency and antibacterial spectrum, thienamycin was itself unsuited for further development because of its chemical instability in concentrated solution and in the solid state. synthesis of the amidine derivative, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (imipenem, mk0787) resulted in a crystalline product with much improved stability and with antibacterial properties significantly superior to thienamycin. imipenem has an unusually broad antimicrobial spectrum. a high order of bactericidal activity is found against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, bacteroides fragilis, enterococci and numerous  other species intrinsically resistant to other antibiotics. imipenem is refractory to hydrolysis by all important classes of bacterial beta-lactamases and thus exhibits no cross-resistance with penicillins or cephalosporins. imipenem is distinguished from the new generation of extended-spectrum cephems by its unusually high potency against gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms. offsetting these excellent antimicrobial properties was an unusual susceptibility exhibited by imipenem to renal metabolism in animal species and in man. very low urinary recoveries resulted without, however, any significant reduction in the serum half-life of imipenem. a brush-border dipeptidase, dehydropeptidase-i, was shown to be responsible for renal metabolism. metabolism  has been countered with the development of cilastatin (mk0791), a substituted amino-propenoate inhibitor of dehydropeptidase which is specific, potent and well matched in its pharmacokinetic properties for co-administration with imipenem. with the imipenem/cilastatin combination, uniformly high urinary concentrations and recovery are obtained regardless of the varying but often extensive metabolism suffered by imipenem in human populations. an additional benefit conferred by cilastatin results from its ability to exclude imipenem competitively from entry into and subsequent metabolism within the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney. the tubular necrosis induced by imipenem alone  when it is administered at very high doses to susceptible mammalian species is thereby eliminated. thus the imipenem/cilastatin combination affords reliability  and enhanced safety in the application of the antibiotic's unusual antibacterial  potential in the treatment of difficult infections regardless of the site of disease.

TI  == moxalactam (latamoxef). a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == moxalactam (latamoxef) is a new synthetic oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, is particularly active against enterobacteriaceae and is resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. moxalactam has moderate activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but on the basis of present evidence can not be recommended as sole antibiotic treatment of known or suspected pseudomonal infections. like the related compounds, the cephalosporins, moxalactam is effective in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. as moxalactam is also active against bacteroides fragilis it has considerable potential in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in patients with normal immunological mechanisms, as well as in immunocompromised patients, when used alone or in combination with other antibiotics. likewise, its ready penetration into the diseased central nervous system, its high level of activity against gram-negative bacilli, and the lack of necessity to monitor drug plasma concentrations, indicate its potential value in  the treatment of neonatal gram-negative bacillary meningitis. further clinical experience is needed before it can be determined whether moxalactam alone can be  used in the treatment of conditions for which the aminoglycosides are drugs of choice, but if established as equally effective, moxalactam has the advantage of  being devoid of nephrotoxicity. bleeding is a potentially serious problem, however, particularly in the elderly, malnourished and in the presence of renal impairment.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of third-generation cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 823 clinical isolates to eight third-generation  cephalosporin and cephalosporinlike antibiotics were studied. all eight antibiotics were more active and had broader spectrums of activity against gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes than older derivatives; however, they were less active against gram-positive cocci. cefotaxime sodium, cefmenoxime hydrochloride, ceftriaxone disodium, and ceftizoxime sodium had similar activities. cefoperazone sodium was more active than those drugs against pseudomonas aeruginosa but less active against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter. ceftazidime pentahydrate was more active against p aeruginosa but  less active against gram-positive cocci. moxalactam disodium was more active against some enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis but less active against gram-positive cocci. thienamycin formamidide monohydrate had the broadest spectrum of activity and was the only antibiotic active against streptococcus faecalis; the only resistant species were p maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of u-63196e, a novel cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-63196e, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and compared with the in vitro activities of cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. although u-63196e inhibited many ampicillin-resistant bacteria and its activity against gram-negative species was similar to cefoperazone, it was much less active than the other agents. u-63196e was less active than cefazolin against gram-positive species, and it was less active than  cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. u-63196e did not inhibit most cefoperazone- or cefsulodin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. there was a difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations for isolates which contained beta-lactamases. plasmid beta-lactamases of the tem, hsv, oxa, and pse types hydrolyzed u-63196e. but u-63196e was relatively stable against hydrolysis by the chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == moxalactam therapy of serious infections.
AB  == twenty-four patients were treated with moxalactam for 25 serious infections. nineteen patients were septicemic and 18 presented severe underlying diseases considered to impair the normal response to bacterial pathogens. all of the pathogens had mics of less than 12 mg/l except one pseudomonas aeruginosa strain  with an mic of 32 mg/l. the dosage ranged from 3 to 12 g/day; the route of administration was either i.v. or i.m. the duration of treatment was six to 26 days. six patients had urinary tract infections (three bacteremia), four had pulmonary abscesses (two bacteremia), five had septic thrombophlebitis (five bacteremia) and ten had miscellaneous infections (nine bacteremia). twenty-two (92%) patients responded favourably. four patients (16.6%) developed superinfections due to organisms highly resistant to moxalactam: three streptococcus faecalis, one bacteroides fragilis and one aspergillus flavus. tolerance was good. nine moderate adverse reactions were observed: three cases of transient eosinophilia, two of phlebitis, three hepatic enzyme alterations and one rash. moxalactam kinetics were measured in serum from 15 patients with normal renal function after receiving 1 g i.v. over 30 min. the mean peak level after the infusion was 82.8 +/- 12.1 (se) mg/l; the mean trough level 8 h later was 6.2 +/- 1.7 (se) mg/l. the serum half-life was 2.6 +/- 0.6 (se) h for the beta phase. plasma clearance was 76.8 +/- 8.2 ml/min. moxalactam was found to be highly effective in the therapy of life-threatening infections.

TI  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and  the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a  broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of temocillin (brl 17421), a new penicillin.
AB  == the activity in vitro of the new parenteral penicillin, temocillin, was determined by an agar dilution technique at two inocula against 201 recent clinical isolates and also against reference strains that produced characterized  beta-lactamases. ampicillin, ticarcillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefoxitin were used as comparative agents. temocillin showed no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or the bacteroides fragilis group but was highly active against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates (serratia marcescens excepted) at less than or equal to 8 mg/l. the mic50 and mic90 were usually within one dilution and results with both inoculum sizes were similar. temocillin also had good activity against haemophilus influenzae and beta-lactamase producing strains were as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase producers. neither for the enterobacteriaceae nor for h. influenzae did a 1000-fold increase in inoculum result in a greater than two-fold increase in mic. the above results implied excellent stability to beta-lactamases and this was borne out by the activity of temocillin against strains containing chromosomal cephalosporinases,  the 'broad-spectrum' class iv enzyme and the plasmid mediated enzymes tem-1, oxa-1 and shv-1. the protein binding of temocillin was found to be 87%.

TI  == prostaglandin cytoprotection and lysosomal stability in acute canine gastric erosions.
AB  == prostaglandin cytoprotection may be related to lysosomal stability. in six mongrel dogs, bacterial peritonitis was created by the intraperitoneal instillation of bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to canine gallbladder bile. in three dogs, gallbladder bile alone was instilled. three of the six dogs with bacterial peritonitis also received 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin e2 (pge2) (0.2 micrograms/kg intramuscularly q6h) 24 hours before and for 3 days after the induction of peritonitis. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, gastroscopic examination demonstrated acute fundic erosions. none of the other dogs developed acute gastric erosions. in the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving pge2, fundic mucosal biopsy specimens demonstrated decreased lysosomal stability. in the dogs receiving pge2, lysosomal stability was similar to that in the animals with bile peritonitis. these experiments demonstrate that pge2 prevents the development of acute gastric erosions by stabilizing lysosomal membranes.

TI  == cefotaxime. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacological properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == synopsis: cefotaxime is a new 'third generation' semisynthetic cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria,  and is generally more active against gram-negative bacteria than the 'first' and  'second generation' cephalosporins. although cefotaxime has some activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the basis of present evidence it cannot be recommended as sole antibiotic therapy for pseudomonal infections. however, cefotaxime has been effective in treating infections due to other 'difficult' organisms, such as multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae. like other cephalosporins, cefotaxime is  effective in treating patients with complicated urinary tract and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacilli. high response rates have also been achieved in patients with gram-negative bacteraemia. although favourable clinical results have been obtained in patients with infections caused by mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms  (such as peritonitis or soft tissue infections), the relatively low in vitro activity of cefotaxime against bacteroides fragilis may restrict its usage in situations where this organism is the suspected or proven pathogen. in preliminary studies, males and females treated with a single intramuscular dose of cefotaxime for uncomplicated gonorrhoea caused by penicillinase-producing strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae responded very favourably. encouraging results have also been reported in open studies in children including neonates, treated with cefotaxime for meningitis and various other serious infections. in some situations, cefotaxime has been given in combination with another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside, but the merits of such a combination have not been clearly  established. whether cefotaxime alone is appropriate therapy for conditions previously treated with aminoglycosides (other than pseudomonal infections) also  needs additional clarification, but if established as equally effective in such conditions cefotaxime offers potentially important clinical and practical advantages in its apparent lack of serious adverse effects and freedom from the need to undertake drug plasma concentration monitoring.

TI  == cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  == the in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. cefoperazone is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. cefoperazone  is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci. against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. haemophilus and neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. against the bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive  because of endemic variations. the drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. cefoperazone  is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.

TI  == cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == cephalosporin antibiotics are bactericidal against most gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli of clinical importance. they are relatively nontoxic but like the penicillins may cause hypersensitivity reactions. agents with clinically advantageous pharmacokinetics include cefazolin, moxalactam, and cefadroxil. first-generation cephalosporins are indicated for surgical prophylaxis and for treatment of most staphylococcal and streptococcal infections in patients who are allergic to penicillins. activity against gram-negative bacilli increases from first- to third-generation drugs, but sensitive isolates should be treated with first-generation agents to prevent resistance to newer cephalosporins and to minimize the expense for the patient. treatment of bacteroides fragilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is not entirely satisfactory with currently available agents. no cephalosporin is active against the enterococci, and superinfection with these organisms has occurred during treatment with moxalactam. some experimental cephalosporins have improved activity against p. aeruginosa and gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to multiple drugs. a few  of these agents have a very long half-life. it is likely that cephalosporin antibiotics will continue to proliferate.

TI  == cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
AB  == cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). the in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against  12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci  to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those  of cefoxitin and cefamandole. no useful activity was present against streptococcus faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes types i, iii, and iv beta-lactamases. hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin padac (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin)  by type i beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.

TI  == in vitro activity of azthreonam, a monobactam antibiotic.
AB  == we studied the activity of azthreonam (sq 26,776), a novel monocyclic beta-lactam compound, against a variety of clinical isolates. it was more potent than moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ticarcillin, tobramycin, or amikacin against strains of klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and the proteus group. it was highly effective against escherichia coli and strains of salmonella spp. the median minimal inhibitory concentration for all species of enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. azthreonam was moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, including tobramycin-resistant  strains, and against pseudomonas cepacia (median minimal inhibitory concentration, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml), but was weakly active against pseudomonas maltophilia and strains of acinetobacter spp. and achromobacter spp. the drug showed little activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and anaerobic  bacteria, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., and gram-positive cocci. like moxalactam and cefoperazone, azthreonam exhibited a considerable inoculum effect with strains of enterobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. combination with clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of azthreonam against s. aureus but was synergistic for 5 of 15 strains of b. fragilis. azthreonam is about 50% bound to human serum protein. the selective range of activity of this compound could be of clinical benefit.

TI  == [antibacterial effects of niridazole. ii. effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. first, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as salmonella and escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole  is completely ineffective. there exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. the in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., fusobacterium spp. and peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. extremely low mic values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are  also relatively resistant to niridazole.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == moxalactam in serious infections: clinical, bacteriologic, and pharmacokinetic studies.
AB  == moxalactam was evaluated in vitro against 600 nosocomial isolates of gram-negative bacteria and was compared with cephalothin, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime. moxalactam was superior to the other compounds, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for 95% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates and less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for 85% of  the bacteroides fragilis isolates; 70% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited with less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. moxalactam at doses ranging from 1 g every 12 hr to 2 g every 8 hr was given to patients with serious infections of the respiratory (14) or urinary (13) tract, abdominal abscess (4),  osteomyelitis (4), meningitis (5), soft-tissue phlegmon (3), malignant external otitis (2), peritonitis (1), and panophthalmitis (1). the clinical response was excellent in 35 (74.5%) and improved in 12 (25.5%) of the 47 patients. the pathogen was eradicated in 29 (61.7%) patients, two patients had relapses, and bacteria persisted but in decreased numbers and without development of resistance in 16 patients. the half-life of moxalactam was 146 (+/- 21) and 125 (+/- 34) min after 2-g intravenous and 1-g intramuscular doses, respectively. kinetic studies  in sputum, bile, bone, aqueous humor, prostatic fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid showed moxalactam concentrations several times higher than the required mics. no  appreciable adverse effects or toxicity were observed.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of moxalactam, an oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == moxalactam, a new synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and was found to have a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. moxalactam showed more potent activity than did the cephalosporins tested against clinical gram-negative isolates, including cefazolin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, and bacteroides fragilis. moxalactam was the only beta-lactam antibiotic of those tested (including nine penicillins and 15 cephalosporins) that was not affected by beta-lactamase produced by 15 strains of 10 gram-negative species. the potent in vitro activity and high stability to beta-lactamase of moxalactam corresponded to lower ed50 (50% effective doses) required against intraperitoneal infections in mice due to various bacteria resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, or cefotiam. furthermore, moxalactam showed the greatest therapeutic activity among the nine beta-lactam antibiotics tested in models of intraperitoneal mixed infection in mice with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == antibacterial activity of desacetylcefotaxime alone and in combination with cefotaxime.
AB  == cefotaxime is metabolized to 3-desacetylcefotaxime. the antibacterial activity of desacetylcefotaxime is four- to eightfold less than that of cefotaxime. the activity of desacetylcefotaxime is species- and strain-specific. although desacetylcefotaxime is less active than cefotaxime, it is more active than cefazolin, cefamandole, or cefoxitin. desacetylcefotaxime does not inhibit many strains of morganella, most strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, some strains of serratia marcescens, some strains of providencia, and many strains of bacteroides fragilis at clinically achievable concentrations. cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against 72% of strains tested, and antagonism between the two compounds is seen only with strains of morganella and  proteus vulgaris. the presence of the metabolite desacetylcefotaxime increases rather than decreases the activity of cefotaxime.

TI  == cefotaxime: a review of in vitro antimicrobial properties and spectrum of activity.
AB  == cefotaxime has remarkable potency against all enterobacteriaceae, including enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and providencia species--all of which are resistant to earlier cephalosporins. cefotaxime generally inhibits greater than 90% of enteric bacilli at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml; in one study it inhibited greater than 98% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. for staphylococci and nonenterococcal streptococci, the mean values for the minimal inhibitory concentration50 (mic50) of cefotaxime (i.e., the lowest concentration inhibiting growth of 50% of tested strains) are 1.1-1.9  microgram/ml and 0.01-0.05 microgram/ml, respectively. cefotaxime is inactive against streptococcus faecalis and most other serogroup d streptococci. it is moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 19 microgram/ml) and acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus (mic50, 18 microgram/ml). because the activity of cefotaxime against other pseudomonads and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli varies, in vitro susceptibility testing must be used as a guide to therapy. cefotaxime is potent against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria species. infections due to beta-lactamase-producing gonococci have been treated effectively with cefotaxime (mic, mode = less than or equal to 0.004 microgram/ml). most anaerobes are highly susceptible to cefotaxime, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 10%-20% of bacteroides fragilis strains (mic50, 5.3 microgram/ml) and other bacteroides species may exceed obtainable serum concentrations. the potent antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime appears to  be the result of a combination of characteristics which include: beta-lactamase stability (types i, iii, iv, and v), good ability to pass through the cell membrane, strong affinity for lethal penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 1b(s), and 3, minimal limitation by the inoculum effect, and bactericidal action at or close to the inhibitory concentration. clinically useful methods of susceptibility testing have been developed and can be recommended for clinical laboratory use.

AB  == the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following  i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and  joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their  extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.

AB  == patterns of fever, shock, and chills in 100 episodes of febrile, gram-negative bacillemia were retrospectively analyzed to determine features predictive of the  site of infection, organism, and prognosis. pneumonias most often produced morning temperature rises, whereas infections in other sites were usually associated with an afternoon or evening peak. peritonitis (usually due to bacteroides fragilis) tended to cause an indolent temperature rise (over a day or more), whereas pyelonephritis and cholangitis typically produced an abrupt "spike." relatively low fevers characterized enterobacter pneumonias while very high fevers were noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with leukemia. chills occurred with unusually high frequency in cholangitis and in klebsiella bacteremia. patients going into shock had higher fevers than those who did not. more importantly, the development of shock was shown to be related to severity of underlying disease. shock never developed if the disease was not serious, unless the bacteremia was caused by instrumentation, but occurred in 73% of patients with leukemia or lymphoma. the clinical setting, pattern of fever, and presence or absence of a chill can in many cases usefully guide diagnosis and therapy in patients with gram-negative bacillemia.

AB  == the in-vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli  has been assessed for ceftazidime and compared to amikacin, gentamicin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime. using the ics-who agar dilution method, we found that ceftazidime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested against 147 isolates of pseudomonas  aeruginosa, with a mode mic=2 mg/l and all but 2% of isolates inhibited at 32 mg/l. 100% of indole-positive and negative proteus spp., 90% of citrobacter spp., 100% of acinetobacter spp. and 98% of enterobacter spp. were inhibited. a total of 142 isolates from the latter 5 groups of organisms were tested. cefoperazone and moxalactam were slightly more active by weight than ceftazidime versus enterobacter spp., but against other gram-negative bacilli ceftazidime was similar or more potent. additionally, 72 clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group were tested against ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoxitin. against these organisms cefoxitin and ceftizoxime were most active. ceftazidime demonstrates potent in-vitro activity against ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae, but it is relatively less active against bacteroides fragilis group than cefoxitin and ceftizoxime.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == ceftazidime and ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), two new parenteral cephalosporins, were compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics against a total of 237 recent clinical isolates. both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone had good activity against the enterobacteriaceae, with 90% of isolates being inhibited by 0.5 mg/l of ceftazidime and by 0.25 mg/l of ceftriaxone. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was about four times more active than ceftriaxone which, in turn, was at least eight times more active than carbenicillin. both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were highly active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae. against the bacteroides fragilis group, neither ceftazidime nor ceftriaxone showed good activity, the mic90 for ceftazidime being > 128 mg/l and the mic90 for ceftriaxone being 32 mg/l. both ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were less active than cephalothin against  staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ceftazidime.
AB  == mic determinations for 275 multiply-resistant nosocomial isolates of enterobacteria showed that ceftazidime was more effective than cefotaxime, cefoxitin or cephalothin. enterobacter species were the most resistant with 12% isolates resistant to more than 8 mg/l of ceftazidime, but this was still the most active agent. of 150 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (55% of which were resistant to gentamicin), only 9% were resistant to 8 mg/l of ceftazidime and 2%  to cefsulodin, both of which were more active than cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone or moxalactam. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, with 30% of strains resistant to 8 mg/l of ceftazidime, but it was more active than cefotaxime or cephalothin.

TI  == ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with mics mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (mics > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mics 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mics 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (mics 0.12-0.25 mg/l). ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (mics mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mics mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). however it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics mostly  1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides spp. (mics mostly 16-64 mg/l for bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. the compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including oxa-1 and the enzymes from klebsiella 1082e and proteus vulgaris pc37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. however, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of bact. fragilis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam  were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against  staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == brl 17421, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, highly resistant to beta-lactamases, giving high and prolonged serum levels in humans.
AB  == brl 17421 is a new semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotic with an unusual spectrum  of antibacterial activity. the compound exhibits exceptional stability to a wide  range of bacterial beta-lactamases and is active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae, including strains highly resistant to many of the penicillins and cephalosporins currently available. among the clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae tested, the frequency of strains resistant to brl 17421 was found to be low, and there was a slow rate of emergence of resistance during in vitro studies. brl 17421 was highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the compound was markedly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis  than against the enterobacteriaceae. against the gram-positive bacteria, brl 17421 showed a very low level of activity. brl 17421 was found to be 85% bound to human serum, and the antibacterial activity was diminished two- to fourfold in the presence of human serum. against experimental infections in mice, the activity of brl 17421 reflected the properties observed in vitro. studies in human volunteers showed unusually high and prolonged serum concentrations of the  compound after parenteral dosage, with a serum half-life of about 5 h, and approximately 85% of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine. brl 17421 was poorly absorbed after oral administration. the compound was well tolerated after  intramuscular and intravenous administration in volunteers, with no adverse side  effects.

TI  == investigation into the microbial flora of healing and non-healing decubitus ulcers.
AB  == seventy-four pressure lesions in fifty-three geriatric patients were observed at  weekly intervals to determine the bacterial flora and the healing index of each lesion, expressed as initial area of lesion (cm2) - final area of lesion (cm2) divided by time in days. the micro-organisms which caused infection included staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides asaccharolyticus. many lesions contained a mixed flora.  p mirabilis and ps aeruginosa were associated with necrotic (p less than 0.005) and enlarging (p less than 5 x 10(-7)) lesions. bacteroides spp were associated with necrotic lesions (p less than 0.05). the presence of s aureus in a lesion was not associated with any particular trend in healing index. the implications of the microbiological findings are discussed.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefoperazone (cpz) and cefotiam (ctm) was compared to other available cephalosporins. using an agar dilution procedure both ctm and cpz were more active against the enterobacteriaceae tested than cefoxitin, cefuroxime and cefazolin; ctm being slightly more active than cpz, in particular against klebsiella spp haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to cpz. ctm had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but cpz exhibited considerable activity (mode mic 4 mg/l). against bacteroides fragilis cpz had a similar activity to cefuroxime, but ctm was less active. ctm was about twice as active as cpz against staphylococcus aureus, cefazolin being the most active agent tested. the mbc was  about twice the mic for each compound and the presence of 75% serum had only a modest effect on the mic and mbc. the protein binding of cpz was 94% and ctm 62%.

TI  == antibiotic prophylaxis with cefoxitin in colorectal surgery: effect on the colon  microflora and septic complications--a clinical model for prediction of the benefit and risks in using a new antibiotic in prophylaxis.
AB  == cefoxitin was administered parenterally in doses of 2 g, every six hours for two  days, to 20 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. blood and fecal specimens were obtained for five days for analysis of cefoxitin concentrations. tissue samples from the gut wall were obtained at surgery. the maximum serum concentrations during surgery varied between 25 and 100 microgram/ml, and the cefoxitin concentrations for the fecal samples were 1.5-35 microgram/g and for the tissue samples, 2.0-50 microgram/g. fecal samples for cultivation of aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria were also obtained daily during the first five days, and after 14 day after operation. pronounced changes in the microflora occurred during the investigation period. among the aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin-sensitive  escherichia coli and other enterobacteria decreased markedly while cefoxitin-resistant enterococci, pseudomonas and enterobacter proliferated during the antibiotic prophylaxis period. among the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis and other gram-negative bacteria decreased significantly. however, after the antibiotic administration period, all cefoxitin-resistant strains decreased while the suppressed e. coli and b. fragilis strains increased. in one patient, a minor postoperative infection caused by a cefoxitin-resistant strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less  than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less  active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels.  bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.

TI  == comparative in vitro studies of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the spectra of activity and potency of ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were  quite similar; they were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis. moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. all six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group d streptococci. the action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally  being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. the only exception to this was found when large inocula of staphylococcus aureus were tested. increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [combined cefotaxime-amikacin treatment of infectious episodes in acute leukaemia patients with therapeutically-induced bone marrow aplasia (author's transl)].
AB  == in view of the clinical results obtained in severe septicaemia due to gram-negative organisms, cefotaxime and amikacin combination was used in leukaemic patients with chemotherapeutic aplasia. 30 infectious episodes were treated in 22 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia, one case of acute flare-up in chronic leukaemia and 7 cases of acute lymphoid leukaemia. cefotaxime was administered at daily doses of 100 mg/kg to the first 4 patients and of 60 mg/kg  to the remaining 26 patients by infusion every 6 hours. amikacin was administered at a daily dose of 15 mg/kg by the same route. 24 excellent results, 4 failures and 1 doubtful result were observed. tolerance was very good. a new infection appeared in 9 patients during prolonged treatment (mean: 13,7 days). cefotaxime appears to be a treatment of choice for infective conditions observed in chemotherapeutic aplastic leukaemia. a cure rate of 80% with amikacin combination can be obtained, but, in vivo, resistant pathogens (streptococcus, group d) or poorly sensitive organisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa + bacteroides fragilis: 1 case) may be selected. then, a new antibiotic treatment, based on accurate bacteriological results, could be given with success.

TI  == conclusion to be derived from in vitro data with respect to in vivo activity.
AB  == cefazolin and gentamicin were administered to mice with polymicrobial infection by escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. changes in the quantities of these bacteria in blood were investigated. bacterial replacement was evident. cefazolin was administered to mice with polymicrobial infection by e. coli and bacteroides fragilis. cefazolin was inactivated by b. fragilis-produced beta-lactamases. it was confirmed that the quantities of both b. fragilis and e.  coli in blood increased. even broad-spectrum antibiotics have different antibacterial activity against various bacteria. the present study suggested that an appropriate administration schedule should be determined to first inhibit the  growth of a highly resistant bacterium in polymicrobial infection. it was also suggested that an antibiotic that can inhibit the growth of a more resistant bacterium should first be administered in polymicrobial infection. in vivo antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be separately evaluated in mono-microbial infection and polymicrobial infection.

TI  == worldwide clinical experience with cefoperazone.
AB  == the safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone 1 to 2g 12-hourly was evaluated  in clinical trials conducted in the united states, europe, south and latin america, and japan. 1046 patients were treated in 4 comparative and 9 non-comparative studies. an overall satisfactory clinical response for cefoperazone therapy was achieved in 540 (88%) of the 615 evaluable patients. cefoperazone was effective in 92% of lower respiratory tract infections, 81% of urinary tract infections, 98% of gynaecological infections and 90% of a mixture of intra-abdominal, wound and soft tissue infections. a satisfactory clinical response was obtained in over 90% of patients infected with organisms normally susceptible to cephalosporins, such as staphylococci, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella and proteus species. 50 to 90% of infections caused by organisms resistant to presently available cephalosporins, such as enterobacter species, proteus vulgaris, providencia species, morganella morganii, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. in the 4 clinical trials comparing cefoperazone with cefamandole, cephazolin or carbenicillin, cefoperazone therapy resulted in a similar or higher rate of satisfactory clinical response. adverse reactions related to cefoperazone occurred in 8% of patients and were mainly diarrhoea (4%), skin reactions (3%) and phlebitis (1%). twice daily dosing with cefoperazone appears to be effective  against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a variety of clinical infections.

TI  == activity of mecillinam alone and in combination with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activities of mecillinam, ticarcillin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin, singly and in all possible combinations, against 53 clinical isolates were studied by a checkerboard method of determining minimal inhibitory concentrations. for selected representative strains, bactericidal activity was determined by minimal bactericidal concentrations and killing curves. mecillinam  was the least active antibiotic against gram-positive cocci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis and the most active against enterobacteriaceae. reproducibility of mecillinam minimal inhibitory concentrations for susceptible enterobacteriaceae was often poor, however, due to minor variations in inoculum size. when mecillinam resistance was observed with enterobacteriaceae, partial inhibition could be demonstrated at concentrations below minimal inhibitory concentrations, and bacterial cells were consistently ovoid or round; under those conditions the addition of a second study antibiotic  resulted in marked synergistic inhibition and killing which was independent of inoculum size and susceptibility to the second antibiotic. in contrast, synergy with mecillinam against mecillinam-susceptible strains or with other antibiotic combinations against any species was not consistently observed.

TI  == comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
AB  == piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed  in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin  with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin  or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.

TI  == structural requirements for antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of 7 beta-arylmalonylamino-7 alpha-methoxy-1-oxacephems.
AB  == replacement of a sulphur atom by an oxygen at the 1-position of the cephem nucleus generally resulted in fourfold to sixteenfold increase of antibacterial activity in each pair of the structural congeners. however, the increased antibacterial activity caused by the replacement was accompanied by instability to beta-lactamase to some extent, which was due presumably to the increased chemical reactivity of the beta-lactam ring system. the aim of the research effort is to confer beta-lactamase stability and expand the gram-negative spectrum. two types of substituents have been demonstrated to protect 1-oxacephem from enzymic hydrolysis and their protecting effects were specifically related to the types of beta-lactamases derived from gram-negative bacteria: the 7 beta-malonylamino function is specific to cephalosporinase and the 7 alpha-methoxy group to penicillinase. the complementary effect of these substituents was clearly demonstrated. this line of studies led us to prepare the clinical candidate 6059-s, which possessed widely expanded antibacterial spectra  against gram-negative bacteria including indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935) with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 420 blood culture isolates.
AB  == to compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. standard broth dilution methods were  used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. ly127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. ly127935 was the most active agent tested against bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. all streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of ly127935 than any other drug, and streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to ly127935 than to any other drug tested, ly127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.

TI  == moxalactam (6059-s), a novel 1-oxa-beta-lactam with an expanded antibacterial spectrum: laboratory evaluation.
AB  == moxalactam (6059-s) {7beta-[2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-7alpha-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl-1h-t etrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-1-oxa-1-dethia-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid disodium salt} is a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative for parenteral use. it  was highly active against a broad range of gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. when a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 10(6) or 10(8) organisms or both per ml, the 70%  minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,  25, and 0.8 mug/ml, respectively. its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. in these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059-s was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration.  6059-s was markedly bactericidal to both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial beta-lactamase degradation. administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059-s attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to  those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either sulbenicillin or piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro studies of moxalactam (ly127935), a new beta-lactam antibiotic with significant activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == moxalactam (ly127935) is a new beta-lactam antibiotic which is chemically related to the cephalosporins. the agent is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae, with most organisms sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. it is also active at low concentration against gentamicin-resistant strains of providencia and serratia. minimal inhibitory concentrations of moxalactam for pseudomonas aeruginosa are approximately four-fold lower than those of carbenicillin for the same isolates.  it is highly active against hemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains, with all strains tested sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. the majority of strains of neisseria gonorrheae and neisseria meningitidis are sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. moxalactam is more active against bacteroides fragilis than cefoxitin. however, activity of moxalactam against gram-positive cocci was uniformly less than cephalothin and other cephalosporins tested. little effect of inoculum size was observed with moxalactam except for particular strains of gram-negative bacilli. the drug was found to be 40-43% bound to human serum proteins.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == the in vitro activities of ly127935 (ly) were compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. ly was highly active (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] range 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) against the common enterobacteriaceae (including providencia stuartiia, enterobacter, and serrati marcescens), 8 to 16  times more active than cefoxitin, cefuroxime, or cefazolin, and from one-half to  one-eighth as active as cefotaxime (hr756). the activity of ly against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 4 and 64 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of test strains, respectively) was essentially similar to that of cefotaxime, but was only one-half as active as cgp 7174/e. ly, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime were essentially equally active against bacteroides fragilis--each was more active than cefuroxime and cefazolin. against staphylococcus aureus, ly (50% mic and 90% mic of 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) was less active than cefotaxime, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime and one-eighth as active as cefazolin. the composition and ph of the culture medium had little effect on the activity of ly, although 7.2 appeared to be the optimum ph.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly-127935, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, was examined by using 370 clinical bacterial strains. in comparison with several other beta-lactam agents, ly-127935 was the most inhibitory against the enterobacteriaceae. it was remarkably active against multi-drug-resistant strains of enterobacter spp., serratia spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ly-127935 had four- to eightfold greater activity than did cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis. production of beta-lactamase by enterobacteriaceae did not influence the minimal inhibitory concentration of ly-127935. however, the beta-lactamase-producing strains of b. fragilis and haemophilus influenzae had generally higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. ly-127935 was the least active agent tested against gram-positive aerobic cocci. variations in ph, salt content, protein content, or inocula size had little influence on susceptibility  to ly-127935. although combination studies with ly-127935 and gentamicin demonstrated synergy for p. aeruginosa, the rates of killing for the combination  and for gentamicin alone were similar.

(5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic piperazine penicillin  derivative, was evaluated against 626 clinical isolates and compared with the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml, piperacillin inhibited all streptococci except enterococci. non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were inhibited by 1.6 microgram or less per ml. both beta-lactamase- and non-beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus were inhibited by 0.1 microgram/ml. piperacillin inhibited non-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, but 20% of strains of these species containing type iii beta-lactamase were not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml. piperacillin at 25 micrograms/ml, inhibited 83% of citrobacter, 58% of klebsiella, 88% of enterobacter, and 50% of indole-positive proteus, acinetobacter, and providencia. at 25 micrograms/ml, piperacillin inhibited 95% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 78% of bacteroides fragilis. the minimal inhibitory concentration of piperacillin against pseudomonas was affected by increasing the  inoculum size and by ph. minimum bactericidal concentrations against pseudomonas  and serratia often were eightfold greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations. piperacillin was equal in activity to ampicillin against enterococci. it was more active than carbenicillin against e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and bacteroides. it was the most active penicillin against pseudomonas and inhibited many strains of pseudomonas for which the mics of carbenicillin were above 200 micrograms/ml. piperacillin was hydrolyzed by many different beta-lactamases. synergistic activity of piperacillin was demonstrated  when it was combined with amikacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. no antagonism was observed when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides; however, antagonism was observed  rarely against e. coli when piperacillin was combined with cefazolin.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  == using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group a strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes). among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested)  and proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis and bacteroides fragilis. therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.

TI  == anaerobes in human biliary tracts.
AB  == during a 2-year period, 1,892 patients underwent biliary tract surgery at the mayo clinic. both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile were performed in 371 of these patients. sixty-nine percent of the cultures were positive, and 41% (117) of these grew anaerobes, although they were present in pure culture only twice. mixed cultures most commonly contained four different organisms (three aerobes and one anaerobe). bacteroides fragilis was the single most commonly isolated anaerobe and ranked fourth in terms of overall isolates behind escherichia coli,  group d streptococci, and klebsiella b. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total  group d streptococci, and klebsiella. b. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total aerobic and anaerobic isolates and was present in 21% of all positive cultures. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens ranked fifth and sixth, providing 6.5 and 5.9% of all isolates, respectively. this study demonstrates the frequent presence of anaerobes in patients with bactibilia and suggests that they be considered in the formulation of antimicrobial therapy for infections involving human biliary tracts.

TI  == bl-s786, a new parenteral cephalosporin. i. a collaborative in vitro susceptibility comparison to cephalothin against 5,762 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of compound bl-s786 was compared with that of cephalothin against 5,762 clinical isolates by the microdilution broth method. bl-s786 demonstrated a broader spectrum and a significantly lower mic against the enterobacteriaceae. although greater susceptibility to bl-s786 than to cephalothin was exhibited by serratia marcescens, proteus morganii and proteus vulgaris, these three species were generally resistant to both drugs. by contrast, the staphylococci were significantly more susceptible to cephalothin than to bl-s786. resistance to both drugs was demonstrated by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonads, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == effect of dilution on recovery of bacteria from blood.
AB  == the multiplication rate of bacteria in undiluted blood containing sodium polyanethol sulfonate was compared with growth rates obtained in dilutions of blood ranging from 1:2 to 1:8. although all organisms tested grew in the undiluted blood, increased growth rates were seen in the 1:2 dilution. further dilution resulted in growth rates equivalent to that obtained with the 1:2 dilution. in view of these results, we question the present recommendations that  blood be diluted 1:10 or 1:20.

TI  == clindamycin and gentamicin for aerobic and anaerobic sepsis.
AB  == thirty-eight adult patients with serious pleuropulmonary, soft-tissue, bone, and  intra-abdominal infections caused by combinations of aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria were treated with parenterally given clindamycin phosphate and gentamicin sulfate and surgery when appropriate. nine had associated bacteremia.  in 29, infections failed to respond to other therapeutic regimens, which included penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol. results with clindamycin and gentamicin were excellent and were attributed primarily to the activity of clindamycin against anaerobes, particularly bacteroides fragilis. serum concentrations of clindamycin surpassed by manyfold the minimal inhibitory  concentrations (mics) for anaerobes. serum concentrations of gentamicin did not consistently surpass the mics for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa,  although those organisms were consistently gentamicinsusceptible by disk diffusion susceptibility tests. persistent colonization with enterobacteriaceae,  p aeruginosa, enterococci, or candida were common, and occasionally they were significant in prolonging the clinical courses of patients with extensive infections.

TI  == cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels and activities of adenylate cyclase and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase in pseudomonas and bacteroides.
AB  == a modified gilman assay was used to determine the concentrations of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (camp) in rapidly filtered cells and in the culture filtrates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli k-12, and bacteroides fragilis. in p. aeruginosa cultures, levels of camp in the filtrate increased with the culture absorbance (3.5 to 19.8 x 10(-9) m) but did not vary significantly with the carbon source used to support growth. intracellular concentrations (0.8 to 3.2 x 10(-5) m) were substantially higher and did not vary appreciably during growth or with carbon source. sodium camp (5 mm) failed to reverse the catabolite repression of inducible glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  (ec 1.1.1.49) synthesis caused by the addition of 10 mm succinate. exogenous camp also had no discernible effect on the catabolite repression control of inducible  mannitol dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.67). p. aeruginosa was found to contain both soluble camp phosphodiesterase (ec 3.1.4.17) and membrane-associated adenylate cyclase (ec 4.6.1.1) activity, and these were compared to the activities detected in crude extracts of e. coli. b. fragilis crude cell extracts contain neither of  these enzyme activities, and little or no camp was detected in cells or culture filtrates of this anaerobic bacterium.

TI  == a gram stain for smears of blood cultures, body fluids and tissues.
AB  == a new gram stain method for blood cultures was adapted from a method for tissue sections. this was accomplished by comparing various modifications of the latter  method on positive smears prepared from a 24-hour negative blood culture seeded with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. a blind study was then conducted using the new method and hucker's method on 24-hour and 72-hour blood cultures as well as a limited number of other body fluids and tissues. of the 35 positive blood cultures detected by the new method, the hucker method failed to detect 14  positive specimens (40 per cent) upon initial examination. ten additional cultures were negative using both stains, but were positive on subculture at three days. the 18 additional cultures positive after ten days were detected using only the hucker stain.

TI  == in vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to  3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin  and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.

TI  == pc-904, a novel broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin with marked antipseudomonal activity: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == pc-904, sodium 6-{d(-)-alpha-(4-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridine-3-carboxamido) phenylacetamido}-penicillanate, is a novel semisynthetic penicillin derivative that possesses a broad spectrum of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities. in low concentrations, pc-904 inhibits growth against large proportions of the gram-positive and gram-negative organisms susceptible to carbenicillin and gentamicin. in addition, pc-904 is several times more potent than carbenicillin against organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, shigella, salmonella, neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and bacteroides fragilis. most striking are the inhibitory effects of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. against these two clinical isolates, pc-904 is, respectively, 35 and 100 times more active than carbenicillin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of pc-904 against p. aeruginosa are comparable  to those of gentamicin. pc-904 acts bactericidally. the effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity is often small and generally comparable to carbenicillin. the rate of binding to serum protein is high (88 to 98%), but the  effect of the addition of serum on the drug's activity is not marked, because such binding is reversible. it is confirmed that pc-904 has a very potent in vivo antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. against systemic infections with p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli in mice, pc-904 is 7 to 10 times, over 8 times, and 2 to 15 times more active than carbenicillin, respectively.

AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.
