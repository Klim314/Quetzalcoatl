exopolysaccharides producing lactobacillus fermentum strain for enhancing rheological and sensory attributes of low-fat dahi.
lactobacillus fermentum v10 was able to show large capsules surrounding the cell  surface and produced 247.37 +/- 0.76 mg/l polysaccharides in fermentation medium. the effect on technological properties of low-fat dahi found to be significantly (p < 0.01) improved for lactobacillus fermentum v10 than control dahi made by eps(+) lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ncdc 285 and eps(-) lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 09 cultures. low fat dahi prepared by exopolysaccharides producing lactobacillus fermentum v10 exhibited optimum acid production, lesser whey separation, higher viscosity, increased adhesiveness and stickiness whereas decreased firmness and work of shear as compared to control dahi.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii, and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.
probiotic attributes of lactobacillus strains isolated from food and of human origin.
lactobacilli isolated from various sources were identified on the basis of 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic region amplification and subsequent sequencing of the smaller intergenic region. an in vitro analysis of probiotic properties including binding, ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile, survival in acidic buffer and antimicrobial activity of four different isolates and two standard strains (lactobacillus plantarum american type culture collection (atcc) 8014 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg)) was carried out. the ability of each isolate to stimulate caco-2 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and thp-1 cells resulting in immunomodulation of these cells was analysed. isolates l. rhamnosus cs25 and l. delbrueckii m and standard strain atcc 8014 showed broad antimicrobial activity, and isolates cs25 (percentage of survival 6.9 % at ph 2.5, 5.1 % at ph 2.0) and l. plantarum cs23 (5.7 % at ph 2.5, 4.9 % at ph 2.0) have shown good tolerance to acidic ph. isolate cs23 showed a good survival (14 %) after 2 h incubation in de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium containing 3 % bile salts. isolates cs23, cs25 and l. fermentum ast1 could stimulate caco-2 cells, human pbmc and thp-1 cells for a strong and varied immunomodulatory response in these cells. though lgg showed poor antimicrobial activity as well as bile and acid tolerance, it was found to be the best binding strain tested. child faecal isolate cs23 from the present study showed high binding ability (seventeen bacteria/caco-2), high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts and significant immunomodulation; therefore it is a good potential probiotic candidate.
modeling bacterial contamination of fuel ethanol fermentation.
the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to treat bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol plants, and therefore, new antibacterial intervention methods and tools to test their application are needed. using shake-flask cultures of saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on saccharified corn mash and strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a dry-grind ethanol facility, a simple model to simulate bacterial contamination and infection was developed. challenging the model with 10(8) cfu/ml lactobacillus fermentum decreased ethanol yield by 27% and increased residual glucose from 6.2 to 45.5 g/l. the magnitude of the effect was proportional to the initial bacterial load, with 10(5) cfu/ml l. fermentum still producing an 8% decrease in ethanol and a 3.2-fold increase in residual glucose. infection was also dependent on the bacterial species used to challenge the fermentation, as neither l. delbrueckii atcc 4797 nor l. amylovorus 0315-7b produced a significant decrease in ethanol when inoculated at a density of 10(8) cfu/ml. in the shake-flask model, treatment with 2 microg/ml virginiamycin mitigated the infection when challenged with a susceptible strain of l. fermentum (mic for virginiamycin < or =2 ppm), but treatment was ineffective at treating infection by a resistant strain of l. fermentum (mic = 16 ppm). the model may find application in developing new antibacterial agents and management practices for use in controlling contamination in the fuel ethanol industry.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
genetic analysis of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
the genes encoding the production of acidocin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus strain m46 which is active against listeria monocytogenes, clostridium sporogenes, brochothrix thermosphacta, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, but inactive against most other lactobacillus species, were previously localized on a 4 kb xbai-hindiii fragment of plasmid pcv461. in the present work, dna sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive orfs, which potentially code for hydrophobic peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 amino acids, respectively, and a fourth orf of opposite polarity which could potentially encode a peptide of 59 amino acids. the middle orf (orf-2; acdb) was identified as the gene encoding acidocin b by comparing the amino acid composition of highly purified acidocin b with the deduced amino acid sequence of orf-2. our results suggest that acidocin b is synthesized as a precursor which is processed at a site which conforms to the ' -3, -1' rules of von heijne to yield active acidocin b (59 amino acids). the presence of an immunity-protein-encoding gene on the 4 kb xbai-bamhi fragment was deduced from the capacity of a plasmid vector harbouring this fragment to confer immunity upon transformation of l. fermentum nck127. one of the three non-assigned orfs may encode this immunity protein.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
