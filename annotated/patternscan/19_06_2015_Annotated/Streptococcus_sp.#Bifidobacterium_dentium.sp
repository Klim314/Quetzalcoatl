TI  == aciduric microbial taxa including scardovia wiggsiae and bifidobacterium spp. in  caries and caries free subjects.
AB  == actinobacteria came into focus of being potential caries-associated pathogens and could, together with the established streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli thus function as caries indicator species. here we analyzed the role and diagnostic predictive value of the acidogenic-aciduric species scardovia wiggsiae and bifidobacterium dentium together with s. mutans, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria  in biofilm of non-cavitated (n=20) and cavitated (n=6) caries lesions versus controls (n=30). for the genus bifidobacterium and for b. dentium new sets of primers were designed. based on real-time quantitative pcr and confirmed by dna sequencing we found a higher prevalence (61.5%) of s. wiggsiae in caries lesions  than in controls (40%). however, among the controls we found three individuals with both the highest absolute and relative s. wiggsiae numbers. testing for s. mutans revealed the same prevalence as s. wiggsiae in caries lesions (61.5%) but  in controls its prevalence was only 10%. b. dentium was never found in healthy plaque but in 30.8% of clinical cases, with the highest numbers in cavitated lesions. the bifidobacterium-genus specific pcr had less discriminative power as  more control samples were positive. we calculated the relative abundances and applied receiver operating characteristic analyses. the top results of specificity (93% and 87%) and sensitivity (100% and 88%) were found when the constraint set was "lactobacillus relative abundance >/=0.02%" and "two aciduric  species with a relative abundance of each >/= 0.007%". combinatory measurement of several aciduric taxa may be useful to reveal caries activity or even to predict  caries progression.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == lab-test((r)) 4: dental caries and bacteriological analysis.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common infectious ultifactorial diseases worldwide, characterized by the progressive demineralization of the tooth, following the action of bacterial acid metabolism. the main factors predisposing  the onset of the carious process are: 1) the presence of bacterial species able to lower the ph until critical values of 5.5, 2) the absence of adequate oral hygiene, 3) an inefficient immune response anti-caries, 4) the type of alimentary diet and 5) the structure of the teeth. among the 200 bacterial species isolated  from dental plaque the most pathogenic for dental caries are: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomices viscusus and bifidobacterium dentium. our laboratory (lab((r)) s.r.l., codigoro, ferrara,  italy) has developed a test for absolute and relative quantification of the most  common oral cariogenic bacteria. the test uses specific primers and probes for the amplification of bacteria genome sequences in polymerase chain reaction real  time. the results provide a profile of patient infection, helpful for improving the diagnosis and planning of preventive treatment to reduce the bacterial load.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == resistance to acidic environments of caries-associated bacteria: bifidobacterium  dentium and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == oral bifidobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. this study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on b. dentium and b. longum, and to compare them with those on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus paracasei. effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a ph of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (mes)-koh buffer at ph 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)) at an extracellular ph of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate n-succinimidyl ester in mes-koh, 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-koh or n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-koh buffer, were investigated. b. longum grew as well as streptococcus strains over a wide ph range, whereas b. dentium grew best  in the narrow ph range around neutral. the cell viability of b. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a ph of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the streptococcus and lactobacillus species, whereas b. longum maintained almost 100% viability. the ph(in) was close to the extracellular ph at ph of 5.5-7.5 in the bifidobacterium and streptococcus strains, while at a ph of <5.0, the ph(in) was higher than the extracellular ph in all the strains, but the ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the streptococcus strains. the high survival rate and ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of s. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.

TI  == bacteria of dental caries in primary and permanent teeth in children and young adults.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a major etiological agent of dental caries, our cross-sectional preliminary study indicated that 10% of subjects with rampant caries in permanent teeth do not have detectable levels of  s. mutans. our aims were to use molecular methods to detect all bacterial species associated with caries in primary and permanent teeth and to determine the bacterial profiles associated with different disease states. plaque was collected from 39 healthy controls and from intact enamel and white-spot lesions, dentin lesions, and deep-dentin lesions in each of 51 subjects with severe caries. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identities. in a reverse-capture checkerboard assay, 243 samples were analyzed for 110 prevalent bacterial species. a sequencing analysis of 1,285 16s rrna clones detected 197 bacterial species/phylotypes, of which 50% were not cultivable. twenty-two new phylotypes were identified. proc mixed tests revealed  health- and disease-associated species. in subjects with s. mutans, additional species, e.g., species of the genera atopobium, propionibacterium, and lactobacillus, were present at significantly higher levels than those of s. mutans. lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium dentium, and low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in subjects with no detectable s. mutans. actinomyces spp. and non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in white-spot lesions, while known acid producers were found at their highest levels later in disease. bacterial profiles change with disease states and differ between primary and secondary dentitions. bacterial species other than s. mutans, e.g., species of the genera veillonella, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and propionibacterium, low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp., and atopobium spp., likely play important roles in caries progression.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin rp 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and rp 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included  for oral streptococci). all compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against gram-positive anaerobes, including actinomyces spp., propionibacterium spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium dentium. azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. in general, rp 59500 had higher mics than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at  2 mg/l. azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the gram-negative anaerobes: fusobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., wolinella spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, selenomonas spp. and mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most gram-negative species, but was superior against capnocytophaga ochraceus and eikenella corrodens. rp 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against fusobacterium spp. and leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were  moderately resistant to erythromycin. the macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas rp 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. the in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. rp 59500 showed useful activity against gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
