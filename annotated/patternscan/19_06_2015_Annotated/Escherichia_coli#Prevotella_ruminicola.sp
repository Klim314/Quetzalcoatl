TI  == a novel multifunctional cellulolytic enzyme screened from metagenomic resources representing ruminal bacteria.
AB  == metagenomic resources representing ruminal bacteria were screened for novel exocellulases using a robotic, high-throughput screening system, the novel celex-br12 gene was identified and the predicted celex-br12 protein was characterized. the celex-br12 gene had an open reading frame (orf) of 1140 base pairs that encoded a 380-amino-acid-protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.8 kda. the amino acid sequence was 83% identical to that of a family 5 glycosyl hydrolase from prevotella ruminicola 23. codon-optimized celex-br12 was  overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified using ni-nta affinity chromatography. the michaelis-menten constant (km value) and maximal reaction velocity (vmax values) for exocellulase activity were 12.92 mum and 1.55 x 10(-)(4 )mumol min(-1), respectively, and the enzyme was optimally active at ph 5.0 and 37 degrees c. multifunctional activities were observed against fluorogenic and natural glycosides, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobioside (0.3 u mg(-1)), cmc (105.9 u mg(-1)), birch wood xylan (132.3 u mg(-1)), oat spelt xylan (67.9 u mg(-1)), and 2-hydroxyethyl-cellulose (26.3 u mg(-1)). based on these findings, we believe that celex-br12 is an efficient multifunctional enzyme as endocellulase/exocellulase/xylanase activities that may prove useful for biotechnological applications.

TI  == purification, characterization, and expression of multiple glutamine synthetases  from prevotella ruminicola 23.
AB  == the prevotella ruminicola 23 genome encodes three different glutamine synthetase  (gs) enzymes: glutamine synthetase i (gsi) (orf02151), gsiii-1 (orf01459), and gsiii-2 (orf02034). gsi, gsiii-1, and gsiii-2 have each been heterologously expressed in and purified from escherichia coli. the subunit molecular mass of gsi was 56 kda, while gsiii-1 and gsiii-2 were both 83 kda. optimal conditions for gamma-glutamyl transferase activity were found to be 35 degrees c at ph 5.6 with 0.25 mm mn(2+) ions (gsi) or 37 degrees c at ph 6.0 (gsiii-1 and gsiii-2) with 0.50 to 1.00 mm mn(2+) ions. gsiii biosynthetic activity was found to be optimal at 50 to 60 degrees c and ph 6.8 to 7.0 with 10 mm mn(2+) ions, while gsi displayed no gs biosynthetic activity. kinetic analysis revealed k(m) values for  glutamate and ammonium as well as for hydrolysis of atp to be 8.58, 0.48, and 1.91 mm, respectively, for gsiii-1 and 1.72, 0.43, and 2.65 mm, respectively, for gsiii-2. a quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr assay (qrt-pcr) revealed gsiii-2 to be significantly induced by high concentrations of ammonia, and this corresponded with increases in measured gs activity. collectively, these results  show that both gsiii enzymes in p. ruminicola 23 are functional and indicate that gsiii-2, flanked by gogat (gltb and gltd genes), plays an important role in the acquisition and metabolism of ammonia, particularly under nonlimiting ammonia growth conditions.

TI  == biochemical characterization and relative expression levels of multiple carbohydrate esterases of the xylanolytic rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola 23 grown on an ester-enriched substrate.
AB  == we measured expression and used biochemical characterization of multiple carbohydrate esterases by the xylanolytic rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola 23 grown on an ester-enriched substrate to gain insight into the carbohydrate esterase activities of this hemicellulolytic rumen bacterium. the p. ruminicola 23 genome contains 16 genes predicted to encode carbohydrate esterase activity, and based on microarray data, four of these were upregulated >2-fold at the transcriptional level during growth on an ester-enriched oligosaccharide (xos(fa,ac)) from corn relative to a nonesterified fraction of corn oligosaccharides (axos). four of the 16 esterases (xyn10d-fae1a, axe1-6a, axea1,  and axe7a), including the two most highly induced esterases (xyn10d-fae1a and axe1-6a), were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. all four enzymes showed the highest activity at physiologically relevant ph (6 to 7) and temperature (30 to 40 degrees c) ranges. the p. ruminicola 23 xyn10d-fae1a (a carbohydrate esterase [ce] family 1 enzyme)  released ferulic acid from methylferulate, wheat bran, corn fiber, and xos(fa,ac), a corn fiber-derived substrate enriched in o-acetyl and ferulic acid  esters, but exhibited negligible activity on sugar acetates. as expected, the p.  ruminicola axe1-6a enzyme, which was predicted to possess two distinct esterase family domains (ce1 and ce6), released ferulic acid from the same substrates as xyn10d-fae1 and was also able to cleave o-acetyl ester bonds from various acetylated oligosaccharides (acxos). the p. ruminicola 23 axea1, which is not assigned to a ce family, and axe7a (ce7) were found to be acetyl esterases that had activity toward a broad range of mostly nonpolymeric acetylated substrates along with acxos. all enzymes were inhibited by the proximal location of other side groups like 4-o-methylglucuronic acid, ferulic acid, or acetyl groups. the unique diversity of carbohydrate esterases in p. ruminicola 23 likely gives it the ability to hydrolyze substituents on the xylan backbone and enhances its capacity to efficiently degrade hemicellulose.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == biochemical analysis of a beta-d-xylosidase and a bifunctional xylanase-ferulic acid esterase from a xylanolytic gene cluster in prevotella ruminicola 23.
AB  == prevotella ruminicola 23 is an obligate anaerobic bacterium in the phylum bacteroidetes that contributes to hemicellulose utilization within the bovine rumen. to gain insight into the cellular machinery that this organism elaborates  to degrade the hemicellulosic polymer xylan, we identified and cloned a gene predicted to encode a bifunctional xylanase-ferulic acid esterase (xyn10d-fae1a)  and expressed the recombinant protein in escherichia coli. biochemical analysis of purified xyn10d-fae1a revealed that this protein possesses both endo-beta-1,4-xylanase and ferulic acid esterase activities. a putative glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 3 beta-d-glucosidase gene, with a novel pa14-like insertion sequence, was identified two genes downstream of xyn10d-fae1a. biochemical analyses of the purified recombinant protein revealed that the putative beta-d-glucosidase has activity for pnp-beta-d-xylopyranoside, pnp-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside, and xylo-oligosaccharides; thus, the gene was designated xyl3a. when incubated in combination with xyn10d-fae1a, xyl3a improved the release of xylose monomers from a hemicellulosic xylan substrate, suggesting  that these two enzymes function synergistically to depolymerize xylan. directed mutagenesis studies of xyn10d-fae1a mapped the catalytic sites for the two enzymatic functionalities to distinct regions within the polypeptide sequence. when a mutation was introduced into the putative catalytic site for the xylanase  domain (e280s), the ferulic acid esterase activity increased threefold, which suggests that the two catalytic domains for xyn10d-fae1a are functionally coupled. directed mutagenesis of conserved residues for xyl3a resulted in attenuation of activity, which supports the assignment of xyl3a as a gh family 3  beta-d-xylosidase.

TI  == type ii restriction modification systems of prevotella bryantii tc1-1 and prevotella ruminicola 23 strains and their effect on the efficiency of dna introduction via electroporation.
AB  == the restriction endonucleases pbrti and pru2i, isoschizomers of sau3ai and haeiii, were partially purified and characterized from anaerobic rumen bacteria prevotella bryantii tc1-1 and prevotella ruminicola 23, respectively. these are the first type ii restriction endonucleases discovered in strains of the genus prevotella, and they represent one of the barriers hindering gene transfer in these microorganisms. heterologous dna was protected against the action of the pbrti or pru2i by incubation in a cell-free extract of the respective strain which contained 20 mm edta. this led to the development of a protocol enabling successful electrotransformation of the p. bryantii tc1-1 strain with a prh3 bacteroides--escherichia coli shuttle vector containing up to 7-kb long dna inserts. plasmid dna isolated from the transformed strain facilitated the transfer with further increased efficiency and made possible the introduction of  ligation reaction products directly to p. bryantii tc1-1 without passing them first through e. coli.

TI  == sequencing and expression of the gene encoding the clostridium stercorarium beta-xylosidase xyl43b in escherichia coli.
AB  == the clostridium stercorarium f-9 xyl43b gene encoding the beta-xylosidase xyl43b  consists of an open reading frame of 1,491 nucleotides that encodes a putative protein, classified in family 43, of 497 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 56,355. the deduced amino acid sequence of xyl43b has sequence similarity with beta-xylosidases from bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron (57% sequence  identity), prevotella ruminicola (45%), streptomyces coelicolor (40%), and clostridium acetobutylicum (36%), all of which have been classified in family 43  of the glycoside hydrolases. xyl43b was purified from a recombinant escherichia coli and characterized. the optimum ph of the purified enzyme was 3.5 and it was  stable over ph from 3.0 to 8.0. its optimum temperature was 80 degrees c and it showed thermostability in the temperature range from 50 to 70 degrees c. xyl43b had a k(m) of 6.2 mm and a v(max) of 15 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside.

TI  == sequence analysis of the plasmid prri2 from the rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola 223/m2/7 and the use of prri2 in prevotella/bacteroides shuttle vectors.
AB  == prri2 is a small cryptic plasmid from the rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola 223/m2/7 which has been used for the construction of shuttle vectors (prh3 and prri207) that replicate in many bacteroides/prevotella strains as well as in escherichia coli. sequence analysis of prri2 reveals that it is a 3240-bp plasmid carrying two clear open reading frames. rep, encoded by orf1, shows 48 and 47% amino acid sequence identity with repa proteins from bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides fragilis, respectively. orf2, named pre, shares 34% amino acid sequence identity with a putative plasmid recombination protein from the flavobacterium spp. plasmid pfl1 and 30% amino acid sequence identity with bmph from b. fragilis tn5520. disruption of orf1 with hindiii prevents replication and maintenance in bacteroides spp. hosts, but shuttle vectors carrying prri2 interrupted within orf2, by ecori*, are able to replicate. prri2 shows no significant similarity with the only other p. ruminicola plasmid to have been studied previously, pram4.

TI  == identification of a novel adenylate cyclase in the ruminal anaerobe, prevotella ruminicola d31d.
AB  == our previous evaluation of ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria showed only prevotella ruminicola d31d produced detectable concentrations of cyclic amp. in order to investigate the synthesis of this important metabolic regulator, the gene for adenylate cyclase (cya), which produces cyclic amp, was cloned and expressed in a cyaa mutant of escherichia coli. the cloned p. ruminicola d31d gene was able to complement the cyaa mutation and permitted fermentation of lactose on macconkey lactose agar plates. analysis of the dna sequence of the 2.5-kilobase pair insert revealed an open reading frame encoding for a 67-kda protein. this protein was novel in that no amino acid similarity was observed with other procaryotic or eucaryotic adenylate cyclases in the genbank database.  production of cyclic amp in the e. coli clone was confirmed with a radioimmunoassay technique. this is the first example of an adenylate cyclase gene identified from an anaerobic bacterium.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of the prevotella ruminicola reca gene.
AB  == the regulation of the reca gene expression in the obligately anaerobic rumen bacterium prevotella ruminicola was investigated by monitoring the reca-specific  transcript level. p. ruminicola reca forms a monocistronic unit, but no sos-box sequences resembling those of escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis can be identified upstream of the reca coding region. at the same time, we observed a fivefold increase in the level of reca mrna in response to dna damaging agents, mitomycin c and methyl methanesulfonate, as well as under conditions of oxidative stress. no induction was detected when growth of p. ruminicola was arrested by shifting to acidic (ph 4.8) conditions. primer extension experiment revealed the  three very close transcriptional start sites for reca. the putative -10 and -35 rna polymerase binding regions were proposed on the basis of transcript mapping.  these regions bear very little similarity to the e. coli (sigma70) and b. subtilis (sigmaa) consensus sequences, as well as to the recognition sites of other minor sigma-factors. transcript mapping experiments in e. coli expressing p. ruminicola reca confirmed that the transcription machineries of these two bacteria recognize completely different regulatory sequences on the template to initiate transcription. preliminary dnase i footprinting analysis data revealed that the region of imperfect dyad symmetry (aattataatcaattataaat) found between the putative -10 region and the translation initiation codon may serve as an sos-box-like regulatory sequence in p. ruminicola. this sequence bears no similarity to the known sos-box sequences and, in particular, to that of e. coli  and other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 operon encoding extracellular polysaccharide hydrolases.
AB  == when escherichia coli xl1-blue mra (p2) was infected with lambda dna containing prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 chromosomal dna, only a few plaques produced beta-1,4-endoglucanase activity, and all of these had mannanase activity. positive phage contained a 17-kb saci dna fragment that gave six bands after ecori digestion. the ecori fragments were ligated into pbluescript and sequenced. the order of the fragments was verified by pcr and by restriction mapping. the dna sequence contained 6 open reading frames (orfs). the 4th and 5th orfs encoded two related beta-1,4-endoglucanases. e. coli clones carrying orf5 and orf6 had beta-1,4-endoglucanase and mannanase activities, while a clone carrying only orf6 hydrolyzed mannan but not carboxymethylcellulose. the 6th orf had three regions of homology to mannanase a from pseudomonas fluorescens. based on these results,  orf6 encoded the mannanase gene. the 3rd orf had 10 regions of homology with cellulose-binding protein a from clostridium cellulovorans. the 1st and 2nd orfs  had no significant homology to genes or amino acid sequences in genebank or swissprot. all of the orfs except 1 encoded a potential signal peptide sequence.  the upstream region of orf1 contained four direct repeats and four inverted repeat elements, but no apparent sigma70 sequence-like promoter was present. the  segment of dna containing the 6 orfs was preceded and followed by potential transcription termination signals suggesting a single transcriptional unit.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and complementation analysis of the reca gene from prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == degenerate pcr primers based on conserved reca protein regions were used to amplify a portion of reca [corrected] from prevotella ruminicola strain 23, which was used as a probe to isolate the full-length reca gene from the p. ruminicola genomic library. the p. ruminicola reca gene encoded a protein of 340 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.81 kda, p. ruminicola reca was highly similar to other reca proteins and most closely resembled that of bacteroides fragilis (75%  identity). it alleviated the methyl methanesulfonate and mitomycin c sensitivities of escherichia coli reca mutants, but did not restore the resistance to uv-light irradiation. mitomycin c treatment of otherwise isogenic e. coli strains showed a higher level of prophage induction in a reca harboring lysogen.

TI  == structural organization of pram4, a cryptic plasmid from prevotella ruminicola.
AB  == a total of 530 strains of rumen bacteria were screened for the presence of plasmid dna. the percentage of plasmid-bearing strains was found to be the highest among the bacteroides/ prevotella group (9.9%), while it was less than 1% in the butyrivibrio (0.2%) and clostridium (0.6%) genera. a small cryptic plasmid pram4 from prevotella ruminicola t31 was subcloned in escherichia coli and completely sequenced. two open reading frames, encoding potential polypeptides of m(r) 32,322 (orf1) and 32,122 (orf2) with limited sequence similarity to replication initiation and mobilization proteins, respectively, could be identified within the sequence. the region upstream from orf1 had an at-rich (75%) region followed by four 22-bp direct repeats, a structure characteristic of replication origins. the plasmid hybridized at high stringency with plasmids from bacteroides/prevotella and butyrivibrio, and with pbr322, suggesting that at least regions of the plasmid are widespread.

TI  == use of a modified bacteroides-prevotella shuttle vector to transfer a reconstructed beta-1,4-d-endoglucanase gene into bacteroides uniformis and prevotella ruminicola b(1)4.
AB  == a carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) gene from prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 was reconstructed by adding a cellulose binding domain from a thermomonospora fusca cellulase and was conjugally transferred from escherichia coli to bacteroides uniformis 0061 by using a chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance shuttle vector (ptc-cow). ptc-cow was specifically constructed to facilitate conjugal transfer of vectors from b. uniformis donors to p. ruminicola recipients. b. uniformis transconjugants containing cmcase constructs cloned into ptc-cow expressed cmr, but they did not produce the reconstructed cmcase until a xylanase promoter from p. ruminicola 23 was added upstream of the cmcase (ptc-xrcmc). the  xylanase promoter allowed the b. uniformis transconjugants to produce large amounts of the reconstructed cmcase, which was present on the outside surface of  the cells. although the reconstructed cmcase alone did not allow b. uniformis to  grow on acid-swollen cellulose, rapid growth was observed when two exocellulases  were added to the culture supernatant. under these conditions, the reconstructed  cmcase permitted faster growth than the wild-type cmcase. the frequency of transfer of ptc-xrcmc from b. uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4 was increased 100-fold when strictly anaerobic conditions, nitrocelluose filters (cell immobilization), and more stringent selections were employed. although the p. ruminicola b(1)4 (ptc-xrcmc) transconjugates expressed tcr and had dna that hybridized with a probe to the shuttle vector, these transconjugants did not produce detectable levels of the reconstructed cmcase even when xylan was the carbon source. on the basis of these results, it appears that not all of the promoters recognized by b. uniformis and p. ruminicola 23 are functional in p. ruminicola b(1)4. however, the results with b. uniformis suggest that the introduction of a p. ruminicola b(1)4 promoter should allow expression of the reconstructed cmcase in p. ruminicola b(1)4.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a membrane-associated prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 beta-glucosidase with cellodextrinase and cyanoglycosidase activities.
AB  == prevotella ruminicola b(1)4 is a gram-negative, anaerobic gastrointestinal bacterium. a 2.4-kbp chromosomal fragment from p. ruminicola encoding an 87-kda aryl-glucosidase (cdxa) with cellodextrinase activity was cloned into escherichia coli dh5 alpha and sequenced. cdxa activity was found predominantly in the membrane fraction of both p. ruminicola and e. coli, but p. ruminicola localized  the protein extracellularly while e. coli did not. the hydrolase had the highest  activity on cellodextrins (3.43 to 4.13 mumol of glucose released min-1 mg of protein-1) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside (3.54 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1). significant activity (70% of p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose. cdxa attacks cellodextrins from the nonreducing end, releasing glucose units, and appears to be an exo-1,4-beta-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.74) which also is able to attack beta-1,6 linkages. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other glycosyl-hydrolases suggests that this enzyme belongs to family 3 (b. henrissat, biochem. j. 280:309-316, 1991). on the  basis of this sequence alignment, the catalytic residues are believed to be asp-275 and glu-265. this is the first report of a cloned ruminal bacterial enzyme which can cleave cyanogenic plant compounds and which may therefore contribute to cyanide toxicity in ruminants.

TI  == cyclic amp in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == an examination of camp levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. cellular camp concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, prevotella ruminicola d31d, selenomonas ruminantium hd4 and d, megasphaera elsdenii b159, streptococcus bovis jb1, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. the results were compared to those for escherichia coli nrrl b3704. the levels of camp ranged from undetectable for b. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for p. ruminicola d31d. varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of camp in these organisms. in general, camp concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for e. coli. the levels of camp in p. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. based on these data it seems unlikely that camp is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in p. ruminicola where it may have an unknown  regulatory function.

TI  == cloning and dna sequence analysis of the region containing attp of the temperate  phage phi ar29 of prevotella ruminicola ar29.
AB  == phage phi ar29 was shown to exist as a prophage integrated into the chromosome of prevotella ruminicola ar29. by dna hybridization studies, the point of integrative recombination on the phage genome (attp) was located on a 4.5 kb ecorv fragment. after preliminary mapping with restriction endonucleases, a 2.8 kb ecorv/hindiii fragment was isolated, cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. dna hybridization localized the attp site to the vicinity of an internal drai site. sequence analysis showed the presence of several direct and inverted repeats around the attp site, with consensus core sequences similar to the integrase binding sites of phage lambda. two open reading frames are present adjacent to attp (orf1 and orf2). the predicted polypeptide product of orf1 has a region of structural similarity to known integrases. although the predicted product of orf2 shows at best weak homology with known excisionases, no other orfs occur in the sequence upstream from orf1, leaving orf2 as the most likely candidate for this role. however, if orf2 does represent an xis gene, then this putative integration module would possess a notable difference from that of other temperate phages in the inversion of the positions of int and xis relative to attp. the proposed phi ar29 integration module is being used to develop phage-based integrative vector systems for the genetic manipulation of rumen bacteria.

AB  == prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola strains b(1)4 and s23 and selenomonas ruminantium strain d used xylose as the sole source of carbohydrate for growth, whereas fibrobacter succinogenes was unable to metabolize xylose. prevotella ruminicola strain b(1)4 exhibited transport activity for xylose. in contrast, f.  succinogenes lacked typical xylose uptake activity but did exhibit low binding potential for the sugar. prevotella ruminicola strains b(1)4 and s23 as well as s. ruminantium d showed low xylose isomerase activities but higher xylulokinase activities, using assays that gave high activities for these enzymes in escherichia coli. xylose isomerase appeared to be produced constitutively in these ruminal bacteria, but xylulokinase was induced to varying degrees with xylose as the source of carbohydrate. fibrobacter succinogenes lacked xylose isomerase and xylulokinase. all three species of ruminal bacteria possessed transketolase, xylulose-5-phosphate epimerase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase activities. neither p. ruminicola b(1)4 nor f. succinogenes s85 showed significant phosphoketolase activity. the data indicate that f. succinogenes is unable to either actively uptake or metabolize xylose as a result of the absence  of functional xylose permease, xylose isomerase, and xylulokinase activities, although it and both p. ruminicola and s. ruminantium possess the essential enzymes of the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate cycle.

TI  == dna sequence and transcription of an endoglucanase gene from prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola ar20.
AB  == the endoglucanase gene was sequenced from prevotella ruminicola ar20, isolated as clone pjw4. the endoglucanase (brend) is encoded by an open reading frame (orf1)  of 501 codons, corresponding to a protein of calculated molecular weight 55.7 kda. analysis of proteins on sds-page revealed a protein corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of the processed brend. the protein showed substantial homology to members of the a4 sub-family cellulases. primer extension studies revealed that transcription of cela is initiated at different sites in escherichia coli and prevotella ruminicola. e. coli sigma 70 recognition sequences were identified, which were located upstream from the transcription initiation site (tis) functional in e. coli. a longer extension product was identified using rna from p. ruminicola, indicating that the gene may normally be transcribed as part of a polycistronic message. the end of the primer extension product corresponded to a site beyond the 5' boundary of the cloned fragment, thus preventing identification of native promoter sequences. a second orf of 110  codons (orf2) was identified on the antisense strand, and primer extension indicated that transcription through orf2 was initiated at an identical site in both e. coli and p. ruminicola. e. coli-like consensus sequences were located at  positions -10 and -35 upstream from this site, suggesting that some promoter sequences in p. ruminicola are similar to e. coli consensus sequences, although others recognized by e. coli are non-functional in p. ruminicola.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == prevotella ruminicola (formerly bacteroides ruminicola) is an anaerobic, gram-negative, polysaccharide-degrading bacterium which is found in the rumina of cattle. since p. ruminicola is thought to make an important contribution to digestion of plant material in rumina, the ability to alter this strain genetically might help improve the efficiency of rumen fermentation. however, previously there has been no way to introduce foreign dna into p. ruminicola strains. in this study we transferred a shuttle vector, prdb5, from the colonic species bacteroides uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4. the transfer frequency was  10(-6) to 10(-7) per recipient. prdb5 contains sequences from pbr328, a cryptic colonic bacteroides plasmid pb8-51, and a colonic bacteroides tetracycline resistance (tcr) gene. prdb5 was mobilized out of b. uniformis by a self-transmissible bacteroides chromosomal element designated tcr emr 12256. prdb5 replicated in escherichia coli as well as in bacteroides spp. and was also  mobilized from e. coli to b. uniformis by using incp plasmid r751. however, direct transfer from e. coli to p. ruminicola b(1)4 was not detected. thus, to introduce cloned dna into p. ruminicola b(1)4, it was necessary first to mobilize the plasmid from e. coli to b. uniformis and then to mobilize the plasmid from b. uniformis to p. ruminicola b(1)4.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
