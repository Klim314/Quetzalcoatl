TI  == bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. as a unique class ii lantibiotic, bovicin hj50 is produced by streptococcus bovis hj50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. by using its precursor bova as a drive sequence, 16 bova-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. from them, three representative novel lan loci from clostridium perfringens d str. jgs1721, bacillus cereus as 1.348 and b. thuringiensis as 1.013 were identified by pcr screening. the corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. the disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. further analysis indicated  that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin hj50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. this  study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics.

TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == identification of glucose-fermenting bacteria present in an in vitro model of the human intestine by rna-stable isotope probing.
AB  == 16s rrna-based stable isotope probing (sip) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)  spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling were used to identify bacteria fermenting  glucose under conditions simulating the human intestine. the tim-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a gi tract microbiota resembling that  of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mm of [u-(13)c]-glucose were added. rna was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h  and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16s rrna revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and clostridium perfringens. distinct (13)c-incorporation into bacterial rna was only observed for the 40-mm addition. 16s rrna fingerprinting showed an activity drop of lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while streptococcus bovis and c. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. accordingly, nmr analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the (13)c-carbon balance. rna-sip combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.

TI  == isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == two-stage reimplantation in infected total knee arthroplasty.
AB  == twenty-one infected total knee arthroplasties (tka) in 21 patients were treated from september 1980 through october 1987. of these, 15 were followed for more than one year. treatment of these patients consisted of thorough debridement of all infected tissue and components; a cement spacer was used in ten patients. the cement was impregnated with antibiotics. this procedure was followed for an average of 4.2 weeks with intravenous antibiotics and tka utilizing antibiotic-impregnated cement. five patients had rheumatoid arthritis and ten had osteoarthritis. the organisms included staphylococcus coagulase negative (seven patients), streptococcus group b (two patients), streptococcus bovis (one patient), enterococcus (one patient), staphylococcus coagulase positive and bacillus circulans (one patient), staphylococcus coagulase negative and enterococcus (one patient), staphylococcus coagulase negative and pseudomonas aeuriginosa (one patient), and clostridium perfringens (one patient). of the 15 patients, 12 appeared to be free of infection, two were obvious failures and required knee fusion, and one was suspected of having continued infection at five years and was treated elsewhere. eleven patients with revision tka were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 2.9 years (range, one to six years).  one patient died five years after reimplantation but had been functioning well. one patient functioning at three years postreimplantation did not return for a later follow-up examination. the average knee score (modification of the hospital for special surgery knee score) was 75.5 points (range, 48-94); average flexion was 81 degrees (range, 52 degrees-120 degrees), and average extension was +6 degrees (range, 0 degrees-30 degrees).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
