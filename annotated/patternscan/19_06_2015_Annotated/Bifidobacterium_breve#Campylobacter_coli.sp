TI  == microbial induction of inflammatory bowel disease associated gene tl1a (tnfsf15)  in antigen presenting cells.
AB  == tl1a is a member of the tnf superfamily and its expression is increased in the mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients. neutralizing anti-mouse tl1a ab attenuates chronic colitis in two t-cell driven murine models, suggesting that tl1a is a central modulator of gut mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. we showed previously that tl1a is induced by immune complexes via the fc gamma r signaling pathway. in this study, we report that multiple bacteria, including gram negative organisms (e. coli, e. coli nissle 1917, salmonella typhimurium), gram positive organisms (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis), partial anaerobes (campylobacter jejuni), and obligate anaerobes (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium breve, clostridium a4) activate tl1a expression in human apc, including monocytes and monocyte-derived dc. bacterially induced tl1a mrna expression correlates with the detection of tl1a protein levels. tl1a induced by bacteria is mediated in part by the tlr signaling pathway and inhibited by downstream blockade of p38 mapk and nf-kappab activation. microbial induction of tl1a production by human apc potentiated cd4(+) t-cell effector function by augmenting ifn-gamma production. our findings  suggest a role for tl1a in pro-inflammatory apc-t cell interactions and implicate tl1a in host responses to enteric microorganisms.

TI  == production and application of new monoclonal antibodies specific for a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to establish monoclonal antibodies that could be used to produce a diagnostic test composed of one kind of monoclonal antibody recognizing a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen. the need to develop such a test  arose from disadvantages of the diagnostic test that uses a polyclonal antibody or plural kinds of monoclonal antibodies, such as the lower specificity for h. pylori antigen and the difficulty of reproduction with consistent quality. mice were immunized with sonicated cells of the coccoid form of h. pylori, and fecal samples from h. pylori-positive subjects were screened by a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (eia) for antibody production from 32 hybridoma clones. the three stable clones produced antibodies (21g2, 41a5, and 82b9) that reacted with  the same soluble antigen. gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular masses of the cellular antigen and the fecal antigen were the same, 260 kda. the  antigen was labile in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat treatments. a single-step direct sandwich eia using a single monoclonal antibody, 21g2, was developed. the eia could detect the antigen in 41 h. pylori clinical isolates and in fecal samples from seven h. pylori-positive subjects. several kinds of helicobacter species (helicobacter felis, helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter mustelae, and helicobacter cinaedi) except h. pylori, major bacteria in feces (campylobacter jejuni, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and escherichia coli), and fecal samples from six h. pylori-negative subjects showed negative results. these results indicate that the new monoclonal antibodies and the new specific eia would be useful as a noninvasive method of diagnosis of h. pylori infection.
