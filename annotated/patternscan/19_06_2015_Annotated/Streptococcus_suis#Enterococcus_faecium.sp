TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == [identification and characterization of a novel antigenic protein of streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  == an immunogenic protein, named hm3, of streptococcus suis type 2 ha9801 was identified by using immunoproteomic assay. some characters of this protein were analyzed by several online bioinformatical tools, including blast, singlp, hmmtop and psortb. the most homologous sequence of hm3 was extracellular solute-binding  protein (gi/69246104) of enterococcus faecium. the predictions results showed that hm3 contained signal peptide and one transmembrane region, and non-cytoplasmic localization were also predicted. partial gene of this protein were amplified from the genome of ha9801 by pcr and inserted into expression plasmid pet-32a (+) after double digested by bamh i and sal i, then transformed into bl21 (de3) where they were induced to express by iptg. after induced, there  was specific proteins band of approximately 45kda on the sds-page gel. western-blotting showed that recombinant protein could react with immune serum of ha9801 of spf (specefic pathogen free) mini-swine. this protein could be taken as vaccine candidate of ss2.

TI  == identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

TI  == identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs ent. hirae was found almost as often as ent. faecalis. most ent. faecium strains  from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in  that they fermented sorbitol. typical ent. avium as well as atypical ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as ent. cecorum, shared  characteristics with ent. columbae. the most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were streptococcus suis and strep. canis. streptococcus  canis and strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. the canine strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. the characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'ton 31 group' and 'o7 group' are described.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.

TI  == teichoic acids of group d streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (streptococcus suis).
AB  == immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with group d antisera. in phenol extracts from s. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with group d antiserum, was seen. this difference probably accounts for  the low yield of group d antigen from s. suis as compared with s. faecalis and s. faecium when heating at ph 2 is used for extraction. when phenol is used good yields are obtained from s. suis as well as from s. faecalis and s. faecium. lipoteichoic acids from s. faecalis and s. faecium have a backbone structure the  same as or similar to that of group a streptococcal teichoic acid. lipoteichoic acid from s. suis has a structure differing from that of s. faecalis and s. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. precipitation reactions between s. suis lipoteichoic acid and group d antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. reactions between s. bovis phenol extracts and some group d antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium were not. this may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from s. suis and s. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of s. faecalis.
