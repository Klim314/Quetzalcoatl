TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == clinical study comparing probiotic lactobacillus gr-1 and rc-14 with metronidazole vaginal gel to treat symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is particularly common in black women, and in nigeria it is often caused by mycoplasma, as well as atopobium, prevotella and gardnerella sp. antimicrobial metronidazole oral therapy is poorly effective in eradicating the condition and restoring the lactobacillus microbiota in the vagina. in this study, 40 women diagnosed with bv by discharge, fishy odor, sialidase positive test and nugent gram stain scoring, were randomized to receive either two dried capsules containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14  each night for 5 days, or 0.75% metronidazole gel, applied vaginally twice a day  (in the morning and evening). follow-up at day 6, 15 and 30 showed cure of bv in  significantly more probiotic treated subjects (16, 17 and 18/20, respectively) compared to metronidazole treatment (9, 9 and 11/20: p=0.016 at day 6, p=0.002 at day 15 and p=0.056 at day 30). this is the first report of an effective (90%) cure of bv using probiotic lactobacilli. given the correlation between bv and hiv, and the high risk of the latter in nigeria, intravaginal use of lactobacilli could provide women with a self-use therapy, similar to over-the-counter anti-yeast medication, for treatment of urogenital infections.
