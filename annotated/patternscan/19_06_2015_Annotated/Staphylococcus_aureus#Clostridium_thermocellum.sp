TI  == characterization of a dockerin-based affinity tag: application for purification of a broad variety of target proteins.
AB  == cellulose, a major component of plant matter, is degraded by a cell surface multiprotein complex called the cellulosome produced by several anaerobic bacteria. this complex coordinates the assembly of different glycoside hydrolases, via a high-affinity ca(2+)-dependent interaction between the enzyme-borne dockerin and the scaffoldin-borne cohesin modules. in this study, we characterized a new protein affinity tag, deltadoc, a truncated version (48 residues) of the clostridium thermocellum cel48s dockerin. the truncated dockerin tag has a binding affinity (k(a)) of 7.7 x 10(8)m(-1), calculated by a competitive enzyme-linked assay system. in order to examine whether the tag can be used for general application in affinity chromatography, it was fused to a range of target proteins, including aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (gfp), c. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, escherichia coli thioesterase/protease i (tep1), and the antibody-binding zz-domain from staphylococcus aureus protein a.  the results of this study significantly extend initial studies performed using the geobacillus stearothermophilus xylanase t-6 as a model system. in addition, the enzymatic activity of a c. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, purified using this approach, was tested and found to be similar to that of a beta-glucosidase preparation (without the deltadoc tag) purified using the standard his-tag. the truncated dockerin derivative functioned as an effective affinity tag through specific interaction with a cognate cohesin, and highly purified target proteins  were obtained in a single step directly from crude cell extracts. the relatively  inexpensive beaded cellulose-based affinity column was reusable and maintained high capacity after each cycle. this study demonstrates that deletion into the first ca(2+)-binding loop of the dockerin module results in an efficient and robust affinity tag that can be generally applied for protein purification.

TI  == structure and flexibility within proteins as identified through small angle x-ray scattering.
AB  == flexibility between domains of proteins is often critical for function. these motions and proteins with large scale flexibility in general are often not readily amenable to conventional structural analysis such as x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) or electron microscopy. a common evolution of a crystallography project, once a high resolution structure has been determined, is to postulate possible sights of flexibility. here we describe an analysis tool using relatively inexpensive small angle x-ray scattering (saxs) measurements to identify flexibility and validate a constructed minimal ensemble of models, which represent highly populated conformations in solution. the resolution of these results is sufficient to address the questions being asked: what kinds of conformations do the domains sample in solution? in our rigid body modeling strategy bilbomd, molecular dynamics (md) simulations are used to explore conformational space. a common strategy is to perform the md simulation on the domains connections at very high  temperature, where the additional kinetic energy prevents the molecule from becoming trapped in a local minimum. the md simulations provide an ensemble of molecular models from which a saxs curve is calculated and compared to the experimental curve. a genetic algorithm is used to identify the minimal ensemble  (minimal ensemble search, mes) required to best fit the experimental data. we demonstrate the use of mes in several model and in four experimental examples.
