TI  == intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with entamoeba histolytica by eric-pcr.
AB  == enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric)-pcr was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with entamoeba histolytica. the dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were  also tested. the intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of eric-pcr bands in the control healthy rabbit  was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. eric-pcr bands of orally  inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). the numbers of the eric-pcr bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i.  were above 95 % with sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, erwinia amylovora and salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 %  with xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, yersinia enterocolitica subsp., shigella flexneri, s. meliloti enterobacterial, yersinia pestis, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and escherichia coli. the prominent bacteria had changed after e. histolytica infection. the dnastar of staple of eric-pcr showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (e. coli, shigella, and salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with e. histolytica.

TI  == characterization of serracin p, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, and its activity against erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen.
AB  == serratia plymithicum j7 culture supernatant displayed activity against many pathogenic strains of erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the most serious bacterial disease of apple and pear trees, fire blight, and against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia liquefaciens, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas fluorescens. this activity increased significantly upon induction with mitomycin  c. a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, named serracin p, was purified from an induced  culture supernatant of s. plymithicum j7. it was found to be the only compound involved in the antibacterial activity against sensitive strains. the n-terminal  amino acid sequence analysis of the two major subunits (23 and 43 kda) of serracin p revealed high homology with the fels-2 prophage of salmonella enterica, the coliphages p2 and 168, the phictx prophage of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a prophage of yersinia pestis. this strongly suggests a common ancestry for serracin p and these bacteriophages.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == molecular analysis of sucrose metabolism of erwinia amylovora and influence on bacterial virulence.
AB  == sucrose is an important storage and transport sugar of plants and an energy source for many phytopathogenic bacteria. to analyze regulation and biochemistry  of sucrose metabolism of the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora, a chromosomal fragment which enabled escherichia coli to utilize sucrose as sole carbon source was cloned. by transposon mutagenesis, the scr regulon of e. amylovora was tagged, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. five open reading frames, with the genes scrk, scry, scra, scrb, and scrr, had high homology to genes of the scr regulons from klebsiella pneumoniae and plasmid pur400. scrb and scrr of e. amylovora were fused to a histidine tag and to the maltose-binding protein (male) of e. coli, respectively. scrb (53 kda) catalyzed  the hydrolysis of sucrose with a k(m) of 125 mm. binding of a male-scrr fusion protein to an scryab promoter fragment was shown by gel mobility shifts. this complex dissociated in the presence of fructose but not after addition of sucrose. expression of the scr regulon was studied with an scryab promoter-green  fluorescent protein gene fusion and measured by flow cytometry and spectrofluorometry. the operon was affected by catabolite repression and induced  by sucrose or fructose. the level of gene induction correlated to the sucrose concentration in plant tissue, as shown by flow cytometry. sucrose mutants created by site-directed mutagenesis did not produce significant fire blight symptoms on apple seedlings, indicating the importance of sucrose metabolism for  colonization of host plants by e. amylovora.

TI  == protein tyrosine kinases in bacterial pathogens are associated with virulence and production of exopolysaccharide.
AB  == in eukaryotes, tyrosine protein phosphorylation has been studied extensively, while in bacteria, it is considered rare and is poorly defined. we demonstrate that escherichia coli possesses a gene, etk, encoding an inner membrane protein that catalyses tyrosine autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a synthetic co-polymer poly(glu:tyr). this protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) was termed ep85 or etk. all the e.coli strains examined possessed etk; however, only a subset of pathogenic strains expressed it. etk is homologous to several bacterial proteins  including the ptk protein of acinetobacter johnsonii, which is the only other known prokaryotic ptk. other etk homologues are amsa of the plant pathogen erwinia amylovora and orf6 of the human pathogen klebsiella pneumoniae. these proteins are involved in the production of exopolysaccharide (eps) required for virulence. we demonstrated that like etk, amsa and probably also orf6 are ptks. taken together, these findings suggest that tyrosine protein phosphorylation in prokaryotes is more common than was appreciated previously, and that etk and its  homologues define a distinct protein family of prokaryotic membrane-associated ptks involved in eps production and virulence. these prokaryotic ptks may serve as a new target for the development of new antibiotics.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of erwinia species based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == the phylogenetic relationships of the type strains of 16 erwinia species were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the 16s rrna genes of these organisms. the sequence data were analyzed by the neighbor-joining method, and each branch was supported by moderate bootstrap values. the phylogenetic tree and sequence analyses confirmed that the genus erwinia is composed of species that exhibit considerable heterogeneity and form four clades that are intermixed with members of other genera, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. cluster i includes the type strains of erwinia herbicola, erwinia milletiae, erwinia ananas, erwinia uredovora, and erwinia stewartii and corresponds to dye's herbicola group. cluster ii consists of erwinia persicinus, erwinia rhapontici, erwinia amylovora, and erwinia cypripedii. cluster iii consists of erwinia carotovora subspecies and erwinia chrysanthemi and is characterized by the production of pectate lyases and cellulases. erwinia salicis, erwinia rubrifaciens, and erwinia nigrifluens form the cluster that is most distantly related to other erwinia species. the data from the sequence analyses are discussed in the context of biochemical and dna-dna hybridization data.

TI  == identification of the promoter region for the colanic acid polysaccharide biosynthetic genes in escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == the colanic acid polysaccharide capsule biosynthetic genes (cps genes) are primarily clustered at one site located at about 45 min on the escherichia coli chromosome. the network of proteins involved in regulating the expression of these genes includes the two positive regulators rcsa and rcsb. this work describes the site of action of these two activator proteins and the promoter of  the cps genes. it is likely that the cps genes are arranged in a single long operon that is at least 13.5 kb. the promoter region was identified with fusions  to lacz that resulted in regulated expression by the rcs network of regulatory proteins, and the start site of transcription was identified by primer extension. the operator region was cloned from kohara phage to multicopy plasmids and identified by titrating rcsa or rcsb. sequence analysis of the promoter and operator region revealed homology to the jumpstart element found in the untranslated region of many exopolysaccharide biosynthetic operons. in addition,  the deduced amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of the first open reading frame of the cps operon was found to be homologous to proteins encoded by the exopolysaccharide biosynthetic operons of klebsiella pneumoniae and erwinia amylovora.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of the rcsa gene from erwinia stewartii.
AB  == rcsa is a positive regulator of genes for extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis in the enterobacteriaceae. the nucleotide sequence of the rcsa gene  from erwinia stewartii was determined and compared to rcsa sequences from e. amylovora, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. three highly conserved regions of the gene were identified. the c-terminal end of the open reading frame (orf) shared significant amino acid homology to the luxr class of bacterial activator proteins. insertion and deletion mutagenesis of the 5' non-coding region indicated that maximal expression of rcsa was dependent upon cis-acting regulatory sequences located more than 300 bp upstream of the translational start site.

TI  == the rcsa gene from erwinia amylovora: identification, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == rcsa is a positive activator of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis in the enterobacteriaceae. a cosmid clone containing the rcsa gene from erwinia amylovora was identified by its ability to restore mucoidy to an e. stewartii rcsa mutant. the rcsa gene was subcloned on a 2.2-kilobase hindiii-psti fragment  that hybridized with an e. stewartii rcsa probe and complemented e. stewartii and escherichia coli rcsa mutants. in addition, the cloned e. amylovora rcsa gene stimulated expression of cps::lac fusions in e. coli and e. stewartii. the rcsa region was sequenced, and one open reading frame of 211 amino acids was found. the predicted protein sequence specified by this open reading frame was 55% homologous with that of the klebsiella pneumoniae rcsa protein. highly conserved  regions in the 3' and 5' ends of the two proteins were observed. an e. amylovora  rcsa mutant was constructed by tn5 mutagenesis of the cloned gene followed by recombination of the mutation into the chromosome of wild-type strain ea1/79. the synthesis of both amylovorin and levan was reduced by more than 90% in this mutant, indicating common regulation of the two polysaccharides by rcsa. virulence of the rcsa mutant on immature pear fruit was diminished but not completely abolished.

TI  == enzymatic degradation of polygalacturonic acid by yersinia and klebsiella species in relation to clinical laboratory procedures.
AB  == as scored by several specified plating procedures, clinical and environmental strains of yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and klebsiella pneumoniae "oxytocum" showed detectable, albeit generally weak, ability to digest polygalacturonic (pectic) acid. none of these bacterial strains had the vigorous  and rapid pectolytic activity on these polygalacturonic acid-containing media that is typical of soft-rot erwinia species, although some of the oxytocum strains came fairly close. analyses of the pectolytic enzyme contents of the cells and culture supernatants of the yersinia and klebsiella species revealed that readily detectable quantities of cell-bound polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase and hydrolytic polygalacturonase were formed by the yersinia and  klebsiella species; however, the total units of enzyme activity produced by these bacteria were, in general, lower than were produced by soft-rot erwinia species.  furthermore, unlike the situation in soft-rot erwinia cultures, these pectolytic  enzymes of yersinia and klebsiella species were not excreted rapidly and massively into the growth medium. cultures of other enterobacteria (citrobacter species, enterobacter species, erwinia amylovora, erwinia herbicola, escherichia  coli, proteus species, salmonella typhimurium, and serratia marcescens) showed no pectolytic ability whatsoever by any of the plating procedures used and (to the extent they were so examined) produced no pectolytic enzymes detectable either in their cells or culture supernatants. this slow or weak release of pectolytic enzymes by yersinia and klebsiella species has a bearing on clinical laboratory procedures suitable for detecting their pectolytic activity; methods adequate for this purpose are detailed.
