TI  == a novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  == to screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. lactobacillus plantarum (hm218749), lactobacillus reuteri (eu547310), and enterococcus faecalis (hm218543) were isolated from the slime on  the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (ph 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). lactobacillus plantarum, l. reuteri, and e. faecalis could adhere to ht-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of shigella dysenteriae 2457, staphylococcus cowan1, enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and escherichia coli 44102 to ht-29 cells.  moreover, the animal experiment showed that l. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.

TI  == heterologous expression of a recombinant lactobacillal beta-galactosidase in lactobacillus plantarum: effect of different parameters on the sakacin p-based expression system.
AB  == background: two overlapping genes lacl and lacm (laclm) encoding for heterodimeric beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus reuteri were previously cloned and over-expressed in the food-grade host strain lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, using the inducible lactobacillal psip expression system. in this study, we analyzed different factors that affect the production of recombinant l. reuteri beta-galactosidase. results: various factors related to the cultivation,  i.e. culture ph, growth temperature, glucose concentration, as well as the induction conditions, including cell concentration at induction point and inducer concentration, were tested. under optimal fermentation conditions, the maximum beta-galactosidase levels obtained were 130 u/mg protein and 35-40 u/ml of fermentation broth corresponding to the formation of approximately 200 mg of recombinant protein per litre of fermentation medium. as calculated from the specific activity of the purified enzyme (190 u/mg), beta-galactosidase yield amounted to roughly 70% of the total soluble intracellular protein of the host organism. it was observed that ph and substrate (glucose) concentration are the most prominent factors affecting the production of recombinant beta-galactosidase. conclusions: the over-expression of recombinant l. reuteri beta-galactosidase in a food-grade host strain was optimized, which is of interest for applications of this enzyme in the food industry. the results provide more detailed insight into these lactobacillal expression systems and confirm the potential of the psip system for efficient, tightly controlled expression of enzymes and proteins in lactobacilli.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == reutericyclin is a unique antimicrobial tetramic acid produced by some strains of lactobacillus reuteri. this study aimed to identify the genetic determinants of reutericyclin biosynthesis. comparisons of the genomes of reutericyclin-producing l. reuteri strains with those of non-reutericyclin-producing strains identified a genomic island of 14 open reading frames (orfs) including genes coding for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps), a polyketide synthase (pks), homologues of phla, phlb, and phlc, and putative transport and regulatory proteins. the protein encoded by rtcn is composed of a condensation domain, an adenylation domain likely specific for d-leucine, and a thiolation domain. rtck codes for a pks that is composed of a ketosynthase domain, an acyl-carrier protein domain, and a thioesterase domain. the products of rtca, rtcb, and rtcc are homologous to the diacetylphloroglucinol-biosynthetic proteins phlabc and may acetylate the tetramic acid moiety produced by rtcn and rtck, forming reutericyclin. deletion of rtcn or rtcabc in l. reuteri tmw1.656 abrogated reutericyclin production but did not affect resistance to reutericyclin. genes coding for transport and regulatory proteins could be deleted only in the reutericyclin-negative l. reuteri strain tmw1.656deltartcn, and these deletions eliminated reutericyclin resistance. the genomic analyses suggest that the reutericyclin genomic island was horizontally acquired from an unknown source during a unique event. the combination of phlabc homologues with both an nrps and a pks has also been identified in the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus plantarum, suggesting that the genes in these organisms and those in l. reuteri share an evolutionary origin.

TI  == phenotypic characteristics and probiotic potentials of lactobacillus spp. isolated from poultry.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus spp., have been considered as excellent probiotic microorganisms, because of their activities in  reducing the enteric diseases and maintaining healthy poultry. objectives: the current study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic characteristics and the probiotic  potentials of lactobacillus spp. isolated from poultry. materials and methods: a  total of 168 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from healthy six and twenty-one-day old chickens and their feed samples. the isolated bacteria were identified by morphological, biochemical, and molecular tests including polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and 16s rrna gene sequencing. biochemical fingerprinting with phene plate system (ph-p) was done and the acid and bile resistant lactobacilli were subjected to the antibiotic susceptibility test. results: amongst all of the examined lab, 30.3% were resistant to bile and acid.  most of the isolated lab (57.1%) belonged to the genus lactobacillus with lactobacillus brevis (78.1%) as the dominant species followed by l. reuteri (16.6%), l. plantarum (3%), and l. vaginalis (2%). the remaining isolates were identified as pediococcus spp. (42.9%). the ph-p cluster analysis of 75 l. brevis and 16 l. reuteri strains showed high phenotypic diversity. whilst the results of ph-p typing from l. reuteri strains showed low phenotypic variations especially among the strains sensitive to acid and bile salts. conclusions: overall, the results showed that some of the high potential probiotic lab species existed in iranian poultry.

TI  == bile tolerance and its effect on antibiotic susceptibility of probiotic lactobacillus candidates.
AB  == before use in practice, it is necessary to precisely identify and characterize a  new probiotic candidate. eight animal lactobacilli and collection strain lactobacillus reuteri ccm 3625 were studied from the point of saccharide fermentation profiles, bile salt resistance, antibiogram profiles, and influence  of bile on sensitivity to antibiotics. studied lactobacilli differed in their sugar fermentation ability determined by api 50chl and their identification based on these profiles did not correspond with molecular-biological one in most cases. survival of strains lactobacillus murinus c and l. reuteri ko4b was not affected  by presence of bile. the resistance of genus lactobacillus to vancomycin and quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) was confirmed in all strains tested. this study provides the new information about oxgall (0.5 and 1 %) effect on the lactobacilli antibiotic susceptibility. antibiotic profiles were not noticeably affected, and both bile concentrations tested had comparable impact on the lactobacilli antibiotic sensitivity. interesting change was noticed in l. murinus c, where the resistance to cephalosporins was reverted to susceptibility. similarly, susceptibility of l. reuteri e to ceftazidime arose after incubation in both concentration of bile. after influence of 1 % bile, lactobacillus mucosae d lost its resistance to gentamicin. on the base of gained outcomes, the best probiotic properties manifested l. reuteri ko4b, lactobacillus plantarum kg4, and l. reuteri e due to their survival in the presence of bile.

TI  == immunomodulation of monocytes by probiotic and selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, are recognized as common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and have received considerable attention in the last decades due to their postulated health-promoting effects. lab and probiotic bacteria can modulate the  host immune response. however, much is unknown about the mediators and mechanisms responsible for their immunological effect. here, we present a study using cytokine secretion from the monocytic cell line thp-1 and nf-kappab activation in the monocytic cell line u937-3xkb-luc to elucidate immune stimulating abilities of lab in vitro. in this study, we investigate both commercially available and potential probiotic lab strains, and the role of putative surface proteins of l.  reuteri using mutants. l. reuteri strains induced the highest cytokine secretion  and the highest nf-kappab activation, whereas l. plantarum strains and l. rhamnosus gg were low inducers/activators. one of the putative l. reuteri surface proteins, hmpref0536_10802, appeared to be of importance for the stimulation of thp-1 cells and the activation of nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells. live and uv-inactivated preparations resulted in different responses for two of the strains investigated. our results add to the complexity in the interaction between lab and human cells and suggest the possible involvement of secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of lab. it is likely that it is the sum of bacterial surface proteins and bacterial metabolites and/or secreted proteins that induce cytokine secretion in thp-1 cells and activate nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells in this study.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == quantitative high-resolution melting pcr analysis for monitoring of fermentation  microbiota in sourdough.
AB  == current methods of monitoring the microbial ecology of food fermentation system are generally labor intensive and/or time consuming. this study developed two methods based on high-resolution melting curves (hrm) to monitor sourdough microbiota during fermentation and to investigate the effect of cereal substrate  on microbial ecology. a strain cocktail of lactobacillus fermentum fua3165, lactobacillus plantarum fua3309, lactobacillus paracasei fua3166 and lactobacillus reuteri fua3168 was used to ferment red (town and pan8609) and white (commercial and segaolane) sorghum sourdough, and wheat sourdough. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate count and hrm-qpcr to differentiate at the species level. the resistance of each species to sorghum phenolic extract was measured. there was no difference in microbial composition among the four sorghum sourdoughs, with l. fermentum fua3165 in all sourdoughs. the competiveness of the strains in sorghum sourdoughs corresponded to their resistance to sorghum phenolic extract. in a second experiment, five l. reuteri strains, the human-lineage strains fua3400 and 3401 isolated from wheat sourdough, the rodent-lineage strain fua5448 isolated from rye sourdough and the  sorghum isolates fua3168 and 3324, were used to ferment wheat, rye and sorghum sourdoughs. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate counts and hrm-qpcr to different l. reuteri strains representing different host-adapted lineages. no difference among different substrates was observed; indicating cereal type had no selective effect on sourdough microbial ecology. in conclusion, hrm-qpcr assays were established as rapid and highly specific tool for monitoring of sourdough microbiota. the ability to distinguish highly similar microbes in samples containing only few genotypes makes hrm-qpcr suitable for quality control in other food fermentation systems. the presence of phenolic compounds in sorghum sourdough favored organisms with higher resistance.

TI  == gut dysbiosis and detection of "live gut bacteria" in blood of japanese patients  with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == objective: mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota are an important modifier of obesity and diabetes. however, so far there is no information on gut  microbiota and "live gut bacteria" in the systemic circulation of japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. research design and methods: using a sensitive reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method, we determined the composition of fecal gut microbiota in 50 japanese patients with type 2 diabetes  and 50 control subjects, and its association with various clinical parameters, including inflammatory markers. we also analyzed the presence of gut bacteria in  blood samples. results: the counts of the clostridium coccoides group, atopobium  cluster, and prevotella (obligate anaerobes) were significantly lower (p < 0.05), while the counts of total lactobacillus (facultative anaerobes) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in fecal samples of diabetic patients than in those of control subjects. especially, the counts of lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus plantarum subgroups were significantly higher (p < 0.05). gut bacteria were detected in blood at a significantly higher rate in diabetic patients than in control subjects (28% vs. 4%, p < 0.01), and most of these bacteria were gram-positive. conclusions: this is the first report of gut dysbiosis in japanese patients with type 2 diabetes as assessed by rt-qpcr. the high rate of gut bacteria in the circulation suggests translocation of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream.

TI  == l-arabinose isomerase and d-xylose isomerase from lactobacillus reuteri: characterization, coexpression in the food grade host lactobacillus plantarum, and application in the conversion of d-galactose and d-glucose.
AB  == the l-arabinose isomerase (l-ai) and the d-xylose isomerase (d-xi) encoding genes from lactobacillus reuteri (dsmz 17509) were cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the proteins were purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography and characterized biochemically. l-ai displayed  maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 6.0, whereas d-xi showed maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 5.0. both enzymes require divalent metal ions. the genes were also ligated into the inducible lactobacillal expression vectors psip409 and psip609, the latter containing a food grade auxotrophy marker instead of an antibiotic resistance marker, and the l-ai- and d-xi-encoding sequences/genes were coexpressed in the food grade host lactobacillus plantarum . the recombinant enzymes were tested for applications in carbohydrate conversion reactions of industrial relevance. the purified l-ai converted d-galactose to d-tagatose with  a maximum conversion rate of 35%, and the d-xi isomerized d-glucose to d-fructose with a maximum conversion rate of 48% at 60 degrees c.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == enrichment of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in hen eggs and broiler chickens meat by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to compare conjugated linoleic acid (cla) concentrations in chickens supplemented with 4 american tissue culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, and 4 isolates of lactobacillus  reuteri from camel, cattle, sheep and goat rumen extracts. 2. micro-organisms were grown anaerobically in mrs broth, and 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria were administered orally to mixed-sex, 1-d-old broiler chickens weekly for 4 weeks and to 23-week-old layer hens weekly for 6 weeks. 3. the 4 strains were evaluated for their effects on synthesis of cla in hen eggs and broiler meat cuts. 4. administration of pure lactobacillus and isolated l. reuteri strains from camel,  cattle, goat and sheep led to significantly increased cla concentrations of 0.2-1.2 mg/g of fat in eggs and 0.3-1.88 mg/g of fat in broiler chicken flesh homogenates of leg, thigh and breast. 5. these data demonstrate that lactic acid  bacteria of animal origin (l. reuteri) significantly enhanced cla synthesis in both eggs and broiler meat cuts.

TI  == isolation and characterization of faecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli isolated from dogs and primates.
AB  == although bifidobacteria and lactobacilli have been suggested beneficial for the host and are components of many probiotics and competitive exclusion mixtures, the knowledge on abundance, metabolic and probiotic characteristics in isolates from dogs and monkeys is still limited. the present study was aimed to isolate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus strains (faeces of 22 dogs and of 5 primates: cebus apella, eulemur fulvus, erythrocebus patas, macaca fascicularis, papio hamadryas) with the maldi-tof identification system lactobacillus murinus, bifidobacterium animalis and pediococcus acidilactici were more frequently isolated species in dogs while lactobacillus plantarum was isolated in several species of primates. ten strains of 6 species were assayed for enzymatic activities (only lactobacillus reuteri strains showed no undesirable enzymatic activity), antimicrobial susceptibility (detected higher minimum inhibitory concentration levels for tetracycline and gentamicin), and inhibitory activity against 15 indicator bacteria. all strains inhibited gram-negative indicators while lactobacilli showed larger inhibition zones than bifidobacteria. l. reuteri ii/3b/a (isolate from m. fascicularis) showed the best antimicrobial properties.  resistance to bile (0.3% w/v) was observed in all tested strains (no decrease of  cfu/ml) whereas the decrease of 68.4-94.4% (after 90 min exposition) and 78.4-99.9% cfu/ml (after 180 min) depending on the strain was detected in the artificial gastric juice.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == [testing of the potentially probiotic lactobacilli for use in food supplements].
AB  == some lactobacilli strains are used as probiotics in food industry and in dietary  supplements. eight lactobacilli strains, originated from the stomach of the lamb  and goatling, are tested for their potential use in human and/or veterinary medicine in our department. sanguinarine is a major alkaloid of papaveraceae suspension cultures. for its antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory properties sanguinarine found application in dental preparations. a mixture of sanguinarine with other alkaloids is used for appetite stimulation of livestock. this paper is focused on testing of selected lactobacilli sensitivity to sanguinarine, isolated from the opium poppy suspension cultures. l. reuteri ko5 demonstrated the lowest sensitivity (mic 0.6  mg.l-1). other less sensitive strains were l. murinus c, l. mucosae d and l. plantarum kg4 (mic 0.3 mg.l-1). for a combination of more strains of microorganisms in one preparation it is necessary to know their ability to influence their growth and survival. to test the mutual influence of lactobacilli, the streak line method on agar plates was used. the results show that the strains l. reuteri e, l. plantarum kg1 a l. reuteri ko4m are the most suitable ones for the use in combinations. keywords: lactobacillus spp. probiotics food supplements sanguinarine.

AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == acid production in dental plaque after exposure to probiotic bacteria.
AB  == background: the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli in health maintenance has raised the question of potential risks. one possible side effect  could be an increased acidogenicity in dental plaque. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on plaque lactic acid (la) production in vitro and in vivo. methods: in the first part (a), suspensions of two lactobacilli strains (l. reuteri dsm 17938, l. plantarum 299v) were added to  suspensions of supragingival dental plaque collected from healthy young adults (n=25). la production after fermentation with either xylitol or fructose was analyzed. in the second part (b), subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (l. reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over trial. the concentration of  la in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline and after 2 weeks.  salivary counts of mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli were estimated with  chair-side methods. results: plaque suspensions with l. reuteri dsm 17938 produced significantly less la compared with l. plantarum 299v or controls (p<0.05). fructose gave higher la concentrations than xylitol. in part b, there were no significant differences in la production between baseline and follow up in any of the groups and no differences between test and placebo were displayed.  the salivary ms counts were not significantly altered during the intervention but the lactobacilli counts increased significantly in the test group (p<0.05). conclusion: lactic acid production in suspensions of plaque and probiotic lactobacilli was strain-dependant and the present study provides no evidence of an increase in plaque acidity by the supply of selected probiotic lactobacilli when challenged by fructose or xylitol. the study protocol was approved by the danish national committee on biomedical research ethics (protocol no h-2-2010-112). trial registration: nct01700712.

TI  == isolation and identification of new lactobacilli from goatling stomach and investigation of reuterin production in lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  == five new strains of lactobacilli isolated from goatling's stomach were identified by molecular-biological approaches. profiles of fermentable saccharides, gram staining, and cell morphology were also determined. they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (strains ko4b, ko4m, ko5) and as lactobacillus plantarum (strains kg1z, kg4). in dna samples of all newly isolated l. reuteri strains as well as in l. reuteri e (lreu e; originated from lamb), the part of gldc gene, coding large subunit of glycerol dehydratase, that is necessary for 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa; reuterin) production, was amplified using two designed primer sets. however, the 3-hpa production was revealed only in the strain lreu e. it produced five- or ten-fold lower amount of 3-hpa in comparison  with probiotic l. reuteri atcc 55730 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions, respectively. moreover, lreu e completely lost its production ability after ca. five passages in mrs medium. the co-incubation of lreu e, but not other l. reuteri isolates, with escherichia coli re-induced 3-hpa production. in the case  of l. reuteri atcc 55730, the 3-hpa production increased more than four times after co-incubation with e. coli.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == biodiversity of antifungal lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw milk samples from cow, ewe and goat over one-year period.
AB  == antifungal lactic acid bacteria (alab) biodiversity was evaluated in raw milk from ewe, cow and goat over one year period. lactic acid bacteria were enumerated using 8 semi-selective media, and systematically screened for their antifungal activity against 4 spoilage fungi commonly encountered in dairy products. depending on the selective medium, between 0.05% (elliker agar) and 5.5% (lamvab  agar) screened colonies showed an antifungal activity. the great majority of these active colonies originated from cow (49%) and goat (43%) milks, whereas only 8% were isolated from ewe milk. penicillium expansum was the most frequently inhibited fungus with 48.5% of colonies active against p. expansum among the 1235 isolated, followed by mucor plumbeus with 30.6% of active colonies, kluyveromyces lactis with only 12.1% of active colonies and pichia anomala with 8.7% of active  colonies. in the tested conditions, 94% of the sequenced active colonies belonged to lactobacillus. among them, targeted fungal species differed according to the lactobacillus group, whose presence largely depended on year period and milk origin. the lb. casei and lb. reuteri groups, predominantly recovered in summer/fall, were overrepresented in the population targeting m. plumbeus, whereas isolates from the lb. plantarum group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting k. lactis, the ones belonging to the lb. buchneri group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting p. anomala. raw milk, especially cow and goat milks from the summer/fall period appeared to be a productive reservoir for antifungal  lactobacilli.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == effect of lactobacilli on paracellular permeability in the gut.
AB  == paracellular permeability is determined by the complex structures of junctions that are located between the epithelial cells. already in 1996, it was shown that the human probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum 299v and the rat-originating strain lactobacillus reuteri r2lc could reduce this permeability in a methotrexate-induced colitis model in the rat. subsequently, many animal models and cell culture systems have shown indications that lactobacilli are able to counteract increased paracellular permeability evoked by cytokines, chemicals, infections, or stress. there have been few human studies focusing on the effect of lactobacilli on intestinal paracellular permeability but recently it has been  shown that they could influence the tight junctions. more precisely, short-term administration of l. plantarum wcsf1 to healthy volunteers increased the relocation of occludin and zo-1 into the tight junction area between duodenal epithelial cells.

AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus reuteri alleviates the response to gastric distension in  rats.
AB  == probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to alleviate symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. however, they have not been tested for use in functional gastric disease. we therefore investigated if strains previously shown to protect from response to colorectal distension (crd) in rats  also modulate response to gastric distension (gd). healthy, male sprague-dawley rats were treated with viable, heat-killed, gamma-irradiated lactobacillus reuteri or viable lactobacillus plantarum wild type (wt), l. plantarum dlt mutant, conditioned medium or medium control (9 d), and subjected to gd under anesthesia using an i.g. teflon catheter. effects were measured by heart rate (hr) changes during noxious distension (60 mm hg) compared to baseline hr values. we also investigated the localization of viable, green fluorescent protein-transfected bacteria in the stomach mucosa. viable l. reuteri decreased the bradycardia induced by noxious gd compared to placebo controls (p < 0.001). heat-killed or gamma-irradiated l. reuteri and conditioned medium did not have a  protective effect in gd. viable l. plantarum wt and dlt mutant, previously shown  to be effective antinociceptive agents in crd, showed no protective effect in gd. all viable bacteria were associated with the pars glandularis of the rat stomach. thus, we conclude that the antinociceptive mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria differ between the stomach and the colon. symptom alleviation cannot be  attributed to the localization of the bacteria in the stomach. information derived from effects of crd cannot be extrapolated to effects in the stomach, which are likely to be strain and organ specific.

AB  == ting is a fermented sorghum product of botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. this study aimed to characterise ting with  respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. the ph values of 10 ting samples from botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and  1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in  all samples and enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. the microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16s rrna genes as lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus harbinensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus coryniformis. binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. all strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in ph from 6.3 to  4 within 8h. traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a ph below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.

TI  == quantitative transcript analysis of the inducible expression system psip: comparison of the overexpression of lactobacillus spp. beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: two sets of overlapping genes, laclmreu and laclmaci, encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, have previously been cloned and expressed using the psip vector system and lactobacillus plantarum wcsf1 as host. despite the high similarity between these laclm genes and the use of identical cloning and expression strategies, strains harboring laclmreu produced about twenty-fold more beta-galactosidase than strains containing laclmaci. results: in this study, the  plasmid copy numbers (pcn) of expression vectors peh9r (laclmreu) and peh9a (laclmaci) as well as the transcription levels of both laclm genes were compared  using quantitative pcr methods. analyses of parallel fermentations of l. plantarum harboring either peh9r or peh9a showed that the expression plasmids were present in similar copy numbers. however, transcript levels of laclm from l. reuteri (peh9r) were up to 18 times higher than those of laclm from l. acidophilus (peh9a). as a control, it was shown that the expression levels of regulatory genes involved in pheromone-induced promoter activation were similar in both strains. conclusion: the use of identical expression strategies for highly similar genes led to very different mrna levels. the data indicate that this difference is primarily caused by translational effects that are likely to affect both mrna synthesis rates and mrna stability. these translational effects  thus seem to be a dominant determinant for the success of gene expression efforts in lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == a food-grade system for inducible gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum using an alanine racemase-encoding selection marker.
AB  == food-grade gene expression systems for lactic acid bacteria are useful for applications in the food industry. we describe a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus plantarum based on psip expression vectors and the use of the homologous alanine racemase gene (alr) as selection marker. a new series of expression vectors were constructed by exchanging the erythromycin resistance  gene (erm) in psip vectors by the l. plantarum wcfs1 alr gene. the vectors were applied for the overexpression of beta-galactosidase genes from l. reuteri l103 and l. plantarum wcfs1 in an alr deletion mutant of l. plantarum wcfs1. the expression levels obtained in this way, i.e. without the use of antibiotics, were comparable to the levels obtained with the conventional system based on selection for erythromycin resistance. the new system is suitable for the production of ingredients and additives for the food industry.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial community of maize silage stored in a bunker silo inoculated with enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to monitor variations in the bacterial community and fermentation products  of maize silage within and between bunker silos. methods and results: silage samples were collected in 2008 and 2009 from three dairy farms, wherein the farmers arranged for a contractor to produce maize silage using bunker silos. silage was prepared using a lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculant consisting of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus buchneri. eight samples were collected from each bunker silo; 4 'outer' and 4 'inner' samples were collected from near the top and the bottom of the silo. the dry matter, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents differed between bunker silos in both sampling years. higher acetic acid, 1-propanol and 1,2-propanediol contents were found in the bottom than the top layers in the 2008 samples, and higher lactic acid content was found in the top than the bottom layers in the 2009 samples. the bacterial community varied more between bunker silos than within a bunker silo in the 2008 samples, whereas differences between the top and the bottom layers were seen across bunker silos in the 2009 samples. the inoculated lab were uniformly distributed, while several nonconventional silage bacteria were also detected. lactobacillus acetotolerans,  lactobacillus panis and acetobacter pasteurianus were detected in both years. stenotrophomonas maltophilia was detected in the 2008 samples, and lactobacillus  reuteri, acinetobacter sp. and rahnella sp. were detected in the 2009 samples. conclusions: although differences were seen within and between bunker silos, the  bacterial community may indicate a different relationship between bunker silos and sampling locations within a bunker silo from that indicated by the fermentation products. significance and impact of the study: analysis of bacterial community can help understand how diverse non-lab and lab species are involved in the ensiling process of bunker-made maize silage.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == lactobacillus-mediated priming of the respiratory mucosa protects against lethal  pneumovirus infection.
AB  == the inflammatory response to respiratory virus infection can be complex and refractory to standard therapy. lactobacilli, when targeted to the respiratory epithelium, are highly effective at suppressing virus-induced inflammation and protecting against lethal disease. specifically, wild-type mice primed via intranasal inoculation with live or heat-inactivated lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus reuteri were completely protected against lethal infection with the virulent rodent pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice; significant protection (60% survival) persisted for at least 13 wk. protection was not unique to lactobacillus species, and it was also observed in response to priming with nonpathogenic gram-positive listeria innocua. priming with live lactobacilli resulted in diminished granulocyte recruitment, diminished expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (cxcl10, cxcl1, ccl2, and tnf), and reduced virus recovery, although we have demonstrated clearly that absolute virus titer does not predict clinical outcome. lactobacillus priming also resulted in prolonged survival and protection against the lethal sequelae of pneumonia virus of mice infection in myd88 gene-deleted (myd88(-/-)) mice, suggesting that the protective mechanisms may be tlr-independent. most intriguing, virus recovery and cytokine expression patterns in lactobacillus-primed myd88(-/-) mice were indistinguishable from those observed in control-primed myd88(-/-) counterparts.  in summary, we have identified and characterized an effective lactobacillus-mediated innate immune shield, which may ultimately serve as critical and long-term protection against infection in the absence of specific antiviral vaccines.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == high-level expression of lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system nice.
AB  == in this work the overlapping genes (lacl and lacm) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri , lb. acidophilus , lb. sakei , and lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (nice) vectors and expressed using lactococcus lactis nz9000 and nz3900 as hosts. the lacl gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisa. chloramphenicol  was employed as selection marker for the standard system using l. lactis nz9000,  whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacf gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing l. lactis nz3900. comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 ku/l of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the laclm genes and the selection marker used. the occurrence of codons less frequently used by l. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacl gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of laclm from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli from sow milk and evaluation of their probiotic potential.
AB  == sow milk protects the piglet against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. in this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in this biological fluid was investigated. milk samples were obtained from 8 sows and a total of 19 rod-shaped isolates were selected for identification and assessment of their probiotic potential. rapd profiling revealed the existence of 8 different genetic profiles among them. one representative of each profile was selected for further characterization and they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri, lb. salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. paraplantarum, lb. brevis and weissella paramesenteroides. then, their probiotic  potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. three strains, lb. reuteri cr20 (a reuterin-producing strain), lb. salivarius cela2 (a  bacteriocin-producing strain) and lb. paraplantarum clb7 displayed the highest probiotic potential.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel tuf promoter from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403.
AB  == genetic engineering of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires a reliable gene expression system. especially, a stable promoter is an important genetic element  to induce gene expression in such a system. we report on a novel tuf promoter (ptuf) of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 that was screened and selected  through analysis of previously published microarray data. ptuf activity was examined and compared with three other known lactococcal promoters (pdnaj, ppfka, and pusp45) using different bacteria as expression hosts. each promoter was, respectively, fused to the promoterless and modified bmpb gene as a reporter, and we estimated promoter activity through bmpb expression. all promoters were active in il1403, and ptuf activity was strongest among them. the activity of each promoter differed by host bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lb25, lactobacillus reuteri atcc23272, and escherichia coli top10f'). ptuf had the highest activity in il1403 when growth reached late log phase. the activity of each promoter correlated with the expression of each cognate gene in the microarray data (r (2) = 0.7186, p = 0.06968). this study revealed that novel food-grade promoters such  as il1403 ptuf can be selected from microarray data for food-grade microorganisms and ptuf can be used to develop a reliable gene expression system in l. lactis.

TI  == coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. material and methods: six lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus (ccug 5917), l. plantarum 299v, l. rhamnosus gg and lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c in man rogosa sharpe (msb) broth for 24 h. four strains of human streptococci (s. mutans ingbritt, s.  mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus (atcc 33478) were similarly grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth. a gastrointestinal pathogen (escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on bhi broth as a positive control. after incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended  in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2). the probiotic strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. coaggregation  was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). results: all  probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the  results were strain specific and dependent on time. s. mutans gs-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and e. coli. the differences among the probiotic strains were modest with l. acidophilus being the most prone and l. rhamnosus lb21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. conclusions: the  results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.

TI  == identification and characterization of antibiotic resistance genes in lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == aims: the study aimed to identify the resistance genes mediating atypical minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and  chloramphenicol within two sets of representative strains of the species lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus plantarum and to characterize identified  genes by means of gene location and sequencing of flanking regions. methods and results: a tet(w) gene was found in 24 of the 28 lact. reuteri strains with atypical mic for tetracycline, whereas four of the six strains with atypical mic  for erythromycin were positive for erm(b) and one strain each was positive for erm(c) and erm(t). the two lact. plantarum strains with atypical mic for tetracycline harboured a plasmid-encoded tet(m) gene. the majority of the tet(w)-positive lact. reuteri strains and all erm-positive lact. reuteri strains  carried the genes on plasmids, as determined by southern blot and a real-time pcr method developed in this study. conclusions: most of the antibiotic-resistant strains of lact. reuteri and lact. plantarum harboured known plasmid-encoded resistance genes. examples of putative transfer machineries adjacent to both plasmid- and chromosome-located resistance genes were also demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: these data provide some of the knowledge required for assessing the possible risk of using lact. reuteri and lact. plantarum strains carrying antibiotic resistance genes as starter cultures and probiotics.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == sugar fermentation in probiotic bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == introduction: food supplemented with probiotic bacteria is a rapidly growing sector of the market. the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the acid production of selected probiotic strains available in commercial products. methods: six lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus plantarum 299v and 931; lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lb21; lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei f19, and lactobacillus reuteri pta 5289) were cultivated at 37 degrees  c in an anaerobic atmosphere on man, rogosa, shape (mrs) agar for 48 h or mrs broth for 16 h. after centrifugation, the cells were washed and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and immediately subjected to a fermentation assay with 12 different carbohydrates (nine sugars and three sugar alcohols) in microtiter plates with a ph indicator. the plates were examined for color changes after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. three scores were used: negative (ph > 6.8); weak (ph 5.2-6.8), and positive (ph  < 5.2). the strains were characterized with the api 50 ch system to confirm their identity. results: l. plantarum fermented all the sugars except for melibiose, raffinose, and xylitol. both l. rhamnosus strains were generally less active although l. rhamnosus gg was slightly more active than strain lb21 in the 5% co(2) setting. the latter strain exhibited negative reactions for sucrose, maltose, arabinose, and sorbitol under anaerobic conditions. the assays with l. paracasei and l. reuteri had negative or weak reactions for all tested sugars under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. conclusion: the metabolic capacity to form acid from dietary sugars differed significantly between the various probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == high-level expression of recombinant beta-galactosidases in lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus sakei using a sakacin p-based expression system.
AB  == this work presents the cloning and expression of the genes encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus reuteri l103, lactobacillus acidophilus r22, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, and lactobacillus sakei lb790. these enzymes  consist of two subunits of approximately 73 and 35 kda, which are encoded by two  overlapping genes, lacl and lacm, respectively. we have cloned these genes into the lactobacillal expression vectors psip403 and psip409, which are based on the  sakacin p operon of l. sakei ( sorvig et al. microbiology 2005, 151, 2439- 2449 ), and expressed them in the host strains l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. sakei lb790.  results varied considerably, ranging from 2.23 to 61.1 u/mg of beta-galactosidase activity, depending on the origin of the laclm genes, the host strain, and the expression vector used. highest expression levels were obtained in a laboratory cultivation of l. plantarum wcfs1 harboring the plasmid peh3r containing the laclm gene from l. reuteri l103. these cultivations yielded approximately 23 000  u of beta-galactosidase activity per liter, corresponding to the formation of roughly 100 mg of recombinant protein per liter of fermentation medium, and beta-galactosidase levels amounted to 55% of the total intracellular protein of the host organism. to further verify the suitability of this expression system, recombinant beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri was purified to apparent homogeneity. the properties of the purified enzyme were essentially identical with the properties of purified native beta-galactosidase from l. reuteri l103. the presented results lead the way to efficient overproduction of beta-galactosidase in a food-grade expression system, which is of high interest for applications in food industry.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == survival and persistence of lactobacillus plantarum 4.1 and lactobacillus reuteri 3s7 in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. are important inhabitants of the intestines of animals. they are also largely used as probiotics for both humans and animals. to exert beneficial effects, lactobacilli have to survive through the gastrointestinal transit. based on bile-salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and  heat resistance, lactobacillus plantarum 4.1 and lactobacillus reuteri 3s7 were previously selected and used as probiotic additives in pelleted feeding trials. both strains were fed to pigs (sows and piglets) at a cell number of ca. 10(10) viable cells per day. a polyphasic approach, comprising growth on selective media, biolog system analysis, 16s rrna gene sequencing and rapd-pcr typing, was  used to identify and differentiate l. plantarum 4.1 and l. reuteri 3s7 from other faecal lactobacillus sp., l. plantarum 4.1 and l. reuteri 3s7 had the capacity to survive during the gastrointestinal transit and were found in the feaces at a cell number of 6-8 log cfu/g. their persistence was shown after 6 days from the administration. compared to untreated pigs, the administration of l. plantarum 4.1 and l. reuteri 3s7 significantly (p<0.05) decreased the population of enterobacteriaceae. besides, the beta-glucuronidase activity of all pigs decreased of ca. 23.0% during administration. the findings of this study showed that l. plantarum 4.1 and l. reuteri 3s7 have the potential to be used as probiotic additives in pelleted feed for pigs.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == trans fatty acids promote the growth of some lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus strains (2 l. gasseri, 2 l. plantarum and 1 l. reuteri) were cultured in modified mrs medium containing fatty acids (fas) instead of tween 80  for 24 h at 37 degrees c, to learn the effect of saturated and unsaturated fas on the lactobacillus growth. free fas included palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (c9-16:1), stearic (18:0), oleic (c9-18:1), elaidic (t9-18:1), cis-vaccenic (c11-18:1), vaccenic (t11-18:1), linoleic (c9, c12-18:2), conjugated linoleic (c9, t11- and t10, c12-18:2), alpha-linolenic (c9, c12, c15-18:3), alpha-eleostearic (c9, t11, t13-18:3), eicosapentaenoic (20:5), and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids. among free fas, oleic acid stimulated the growth of all lactobacillus strains, whereas palmitoleic acid had almost no affect on the lactobacillus growth. saturated fas such as stearic and palmitic acids inhibited  or did not affect the lactobacillus growth. polyunsaturated fas such as alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids strongly inhibited the lactobacillus growth at 7.6 x 10(-4) m. octadecenoic acids such as oleic, elaidic, cis-vaccenic and vaccenic acids remarkably promoted the growth of l. gasseri, regardless of the different double bond positions and configurations. when oleic or cis-vaccenic acid was incubated with l. gasseri, the fas was transformed to cyclopropane fas (methyleneoctadecanoic acids) after incorporation into the cells. on the other hand, trans fas such as elaidic and vaccenic acids incorporated into the cells were not converted to another fas. conjugated linoleic and alpha-eleostearic acids having a trans double bond promoted the lactobacillus growth. the growth of l. gasseri was also stimulated by trans-rich  free fas from hydrogenated canola and fish oils. these results showed that octadecenoic acid and trans fas had strong promotion activities for the lactobacillus growth due to their incorporation into membrane lipids.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == growth of lactic acid bacteria and rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  == the zygomycete rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. the traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. lactic acid bacteria (lab) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of lab on r. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. we have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with r. oligosporus atcc 64063.  four lab species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on r. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. growth of lab was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of r. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. the two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, p<0.001, n=90). the ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. l. plantarum multiplied  from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and l. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c. l. reuteri and l. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to  5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. the growth of r. oligosporus and the final ph (4.9)  in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the lab investigated.

TI  == selective probiotic bacteria induce il-10-producing regulatory t cells in vitro by modulating dendritic cell function through dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are frequently tested in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. it is hypothesized that these probiotics have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance, which  is in part mediated by regulatory t cells (treg cells). on the basis of pathogenic or tissue-specific priming, dendritic cells (dc) acquire different t cell-instructive signals and drive the differentiation of naive t h cells into either t h 1, t h 2, or regulatory effector t cells. objective: we studied in what way different species of lactobacilli prime human dcs for their ability to drive treg cells. methods: human monocyte-derived dcs were cultured in vitro with lactobacilli of different species. results: two different species of lactobacilli, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei , but not lactobacillus plantarum, prime monocyte-derived dcs to drive the development of treg cells. these treg cells produced increased levels of il-10 and were capable  of inhibiting the proliferation of bystander t cells in an il-10-dependent fashion. strikingly, both l reuteri and l casei , but not l plantarum , bind the  c-type lectin dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (dc-sign). blocking antibodies to dc-sign inhibited the induction of the treg cells by these probiotic bacteria, stressing that ligation of dc-sign can actively prime dcs to induce treg cells. conclusions: the targeting of dc-sign by certain probiotic bacteria might explain their beneficial effect in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis and crohn's disease.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the effect of malt, wheat and barley extracts on the viability of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria under acidic conditions.
AB  == in this work, the effect of cereal extracts, used as delivery vehicles for potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab), on the acid tolerance of the cells was evaluated under conditions that simulate the gastric tract. more specifically, the effect of malt, barley and wheat extracts on the viability of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus reuteri during exposure for 4 h in a phosphate buffer acidified at ph 2.5 was investigated. in the absence of cereal extracts all strains demonstrated a significant reduction in their cell population, particularly l. plantarum. the viability of l. plantarum was improved by approximately 4 log(10) cycles in the presence of malt and 3 log(10) cycles in the presence of wheat and barley. the survival of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri was increased by more than 1.5 and 0.7  log(10) cycle, respectively, upon addition of cereal extracts. in order to evaluate the contribution of the cereal constituents on cell survival, the individual effect of glucose, maltose and free amino nitrogen (fan), which were added at concentrations that correlated to the reducing sugar and fan content of  the cereal extracts, was examined. the viability of l. plantarum was progressively improved as the maltose or glucose concentration increased; an increase by approximately 2 log(10) cycles was observed in the presence of 8.33 g/l sugar. the survival of l. acidophilus increased by more than 1 log(10) cycle, even at very low concentrations of maltose and glucose (e.g., 0.67 g/l), while l. reuteri stability was enhanced in the presence of maltose but no appreciable effect was demonstrated in the presence of glucose. sugar analysis indicated that glycolysis was inhibited in all cases. addition of tryptone and yeast extract, used as sources of fan, enhanced l. acidophilus acid tolerance, but did not affect l. reuteri and l. plantarum. the results presented in this study indicate  that malt, wheat and barley extracts exhibit a significant protective effect on the viability of l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri under acidic conditions, which could be mainly attributed to the amount of sugar present in the cereal extracts.

TI  == growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

TI  == effect of oral supplementation of lactobacilli on bacterial translocation in acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine.
AB  == background/aim: bacterial infections and sepsis are frequent complications of acute liver injury, with a high share in the mortality and morbidity of this condition. bacterial translocation from the gut may play an important role in the high rate of infections observed. in this experiment the effect of different oral supplementation on bacterial translocation was evaluated in acute liver injury induced by d-galactosamine in the rat. methods: rats were given oral supplements  of lactulose, neomycin, lactobacillus reuteri r2lc, and lactobacillus plantarum dsm 9843 for 1 week. liver injury was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 1.1 g/kg d-galactosamine. twenty-four hours later, rats were sacrificed and liver enzymes and histology, intestinal bacterial count and microflora, intestinal mucosal histology, dna and rna content, bacterial translocation to blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver, and serum endotoxin were studied or measured. results: lactulose was highly effective in prevention of liver injury and bacterial translocation. neomycin and lactobacillus plantarum dsm 9843 showed a moderate effect in prevention of liver injury and bacterial translocation. intestinal bacterial count and microflora were affected by different treatment modalities. no endotoxin concentration was found in any of the experimental groups. both lactobacilli could significantly improve the mucosal proliferative state. conclusions: oral supplementation of lactulose with anti-endotoxin effect  could successfully prevent the liver injury and the subsequent bacterial translocation in acute liver injury induced by administration of d-galactosamine  in the rat. this effect was irrespective of the intestinal bacterial alteration or mucosal proliferative state.

TI  == the effects of lactobacillus strains and oat fiber on methotrexate-induced enterocolitis in rats.
AB  == background & aims: administration of methotrexate to rats on an elemental diet results in severe enterocolitis and death. lactobacilli, an integral part of the  healthy gastrointestinal microecology, may provide therapeutic benefits to help the recovery from enterocolitis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of lactobacilli and oatbase on methotrexate-induced enterocolitis in rats. methods: rats received continuous intragastric infusion of elemental diet or with supplementation of oatbase, lactobacillus reuteri r2lc, and lactobacillus plantarum dsm 9843, with and without fermentation, from the beginning of the study. methotrexate (20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally on day 3, and the sampling was performed on day 6. results: lactobacilli and oatbase decreased body weight loss and intestinal permeability and increased bowel mucosal mass in enterocolitic rats. administration of lactobacilli, but not oatbase, decreased the intestinal myeloperoxidase level, reestablished intestinal microecology, and  reduced bacterial translocation to extraintestinal sites. both lactobacilli and oatbase reduced plasma endotoxin levels. the effects of lactobacilli were greater with fermentation than without fermentation or oatbase alone, and l. plantarum was more effective in reducing intestinal pathogens than l. reuteri. conclusions: exogenous administration of lactobacilli, especially l. plantarum with fermentation, is helpful in reducing the severity of enterocolitis in rats.

TI  == development of rapd protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  == a protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments has been developed. using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic dna. different conditions of dna release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. this rapd protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. helveticus, lact. casei, lact. reuteri, lact. plantarum, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium  and streptococcus thermophilus.

TI  == aggregation-promoting factor in pig intestinal lactobacillus strains.
AB  == autoaggregation was frequently encountered among intestinal lactobacilli isolated from weaned pigs. the aggregation mechanism was shown to be mediated by the production of a proteinaceous aggregation-promoting factor in two strains of lactobacillus reuteri. a 32 kda aggregation-promoting protein was detected in these strains by cross-reaction with rabbit polyclonal antibodies for aggregation-promoting factor produced by the human isolate lact. plantarum 4b2. coaggregation reactions of lact. reuteri strains with pathogenic and non-pathogenic escherichia coli were detected.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.
