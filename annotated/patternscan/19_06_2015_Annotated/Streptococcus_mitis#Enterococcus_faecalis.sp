TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of ferula gummosa plant essential oil compared to naocl and chx: a preliminary in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: the usage of medicinal plants as natural antimicrobial agents has grown in many fields including dental medicine. the aim of this in vitro study was three-fold: (i) to determine the chemical compositions of the ferula gummosa  essential oil (fgeo), (ii) to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of the oil with  sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine (chx), (iii) to assess the toxic behavior of fgeo in different concentrations compared to 5% naocl and 0.2% chx. materials and methods: gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) was used to determine the chemical compositions of the oil. the disk diffusion method and a broth micro-dilution susceptibility assay were exploited to assess the antimicrobial efficacy against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and candida albicans. the cytocompatibility of the fgeo was  assessed on l929 fibroblasts, and compared to that of naocl and chx. results: twenty-seven constituents were recognized in fgeo. the major component of the oil was beta-pinene (51.83%). all three irrigants significantly inhibited the growth  of all examined microorganisms compared to the negative control group. fgeo at 50 microg/ml was effective in lower concentration against enterococcus faecalis than 5% naocl and 0.2% chx, and was also more potent than 0.2% chx against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. fgeo was a cytocompatible solution, and had significantly lower toxicity compared to 5% naocl and 0.2% chx. conclusions: fgeo showed a promising biological potency as a root canal disinfectant. more investigations are required on the effectiveness of this oil on intracanal bacterial biofilms.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == comparative analysis of the biological and physical properties of enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage vb_efas_gec-efs_3 and streptococcus mitis bacteriophage vb_smm_gec-smitism_2.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mitis are common commensal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. however, both species can be opportunistic pathogens and cause disease in nosocomial settings. these infections can be difficult to treat because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance among these strains. bacteriophages are often suggested as an alternative therapeutic agent against these infections. in this study, e. faecalis and s. mitis strains were isolated from female patients with urinary tract infections. bacteriophages active against these strains were isolated from  sewage water from the mtkvari river. two phages, designated vb_efas_gec-efs_3 (syphoviridae) and vb_smm_gec-smitism_2 (myoviridae), were specific for e. faecalis and s. mitis, respectively. each phage's growth patterns and adsorption  rates were quantified. sensitivity to ultraviolet light and temperature was determined, as was host range and serology. the s. mitis bacteriophage was found  to be more resistant to ultraviolet light and exposure to high temperatures than  the e. faecalis bacteriophage, despite having a much greater rate of replication. while each phage was able to infect a broad range of strains of the same species  as the host species from which they were isolated, they were unable to infect other host species tested.

TI  == non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced il-17 production in human t cells.
AB  == interleukin-17 (il-17) is produced by a subset of cd4(+) t helper (th) lymphocytes known as th17 cells. in humans, il-1beta, enhanced by il-6 and il-23  is crucial for differentiation of these cells. il-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. the genus mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. here we investigated il-17 and il-23 production in human pbmc in response to intact uv-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (mycobacterium gordonae) species. representative gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of il-17, while il-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. purified cd4(+) t cells, but not cd4-depleted cell fractions, produced this il-17. isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced il-17, but not il-23 production. the ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce il-17 production in cd4(+) t cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential  of the particular mycobacterial species.

TI  == the surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the genus mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. mycobacteria have a unique  cell wall abundant in lipids. here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic  mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. the cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. mycobacteria induced no il-12 and less tnf and ifn-gamma compared with  conventional gram-positive bacteria. il-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of il-12 and ifn-gamma. the capacity of the gram-positive bacterium e. faecalis to induce il-12, as well as tnf and ifn-gamma, in human pbmcs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. the mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated  the production of il-12 and ifn-gamma without eliciting il-10 production. our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (il-12, tnf and ifn-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.

TI  == salivary iga antibody responses to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans in preterm and fullterm newborn children.
AB  == objectives: the intensities and specificities of salivary iga antibody responses  to antigens of streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, may influence colonization by these organisms during the first 1.5 year of life. thus, the ontogeny of salivary iga responses to oral colonizers continues to warrant investigation, especially with regard to the influence of birth conditions, e.g. prematurity, on the ability of children to efficiently respond to oral microorganisms. in this study, we characterised the salivary antibody responses to two bacterial species which are prototypes of pioneer and pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity (streptococcus mitis and streptococcus mutans,  respectively) in fullterm (ft) and preterm (pt) newborn children. methods: salivas from 123 infants (70 ft and 53 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth and levels of iga and igm antibodies and the presence of s. mutans and s. mitis were analysed respectively by elisa and by chequerboard dna-dna hybridization. two subgroups of 24 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against s. mutans and s. mitis antigens, using western blot assays. cross-adsorption of 10 infant's saliva was tested to s. mitis, s. mutans and enterococcus faecalis antigens. results: salivary levels of iga at birth were 2.5-fold higher in ft than in pt children (mann-whitney; p<0.05). salivary iga antibodies reactive with several antigens of s. mitis and s. mutans were detected at birth in children with undetectable levels of those bacteria. adsorption of infant saliva with cells of s. mutans produced a reduction of antibodies recognizing s. mitis antigens in half of the neonates. the diversity and intensity of iga responses were lower in pt compared  to ft children, although those differences were not significant. conclusion: these data provide evidence that children have salivary iga antibodies shortly after birth, which might influence the establishment of the oral microbiota, and  that the levels of salivary antibody might be related to prematurity.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate polymicrobial coronal leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and amalgam. there were 108 single-rooted teeth  randomly divided into 3 groups of 32 teeth each and positive and negative control groups of 6 teeth and obturated with gutta percha and either diaket (3m/espe, seefeld, germany), ah plus (dentsply, de trey, konstanz, germany), or ketac endo  (3m/espe). these groups were further divided into 2 subgroups of 16 teeth in which root ends were resected and obturated with either mta or zinc-free amalgam. the samples have been incorporated in a dual-chamber leakage model with a polymicrobial marker of five facultative anaerobes on the coronal part. leakage was observing during a period of 90 days. the least leakage was found in a combination of diaket and mta (76.9 +/-14.8 days) followed by ah plus and mta (66.1 +/- 18.7), diaket and amalgam (60.0 +/- 23.1), ah plus and amalgam (56.9 +/- 22.1), and ketac endo and mta (42.1 +/- 17.8), whereas the greatest leakage was observed in the ketac endo and amalgam group (40.0 +/- 17.24). samples filled with mta showed significantly better sealing than samples filled with amalgam (p  < 0.05).

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == antibody binding to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis cell fractions.
AB  == objective: to determine which cell fraction(s) of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary siga antibodies in infants. design: whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of s. mitis,  streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (cw), protease-treated cell walls (ptcw), cell membranes (cm) and cell protein (cp). whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-s. mitis sk145 and anti-s. oralis sk100 sera, and also by salivary siga antibodies from infants and adults.  results: anti-sk145 and anti-sk100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of s. mitis and s. oralis variably. cluster analysis of antibody binding  data placed the strains into s. mitis, s. oralis and 'non-s. mitis/non-s. oralis' clusters. antigens from cw and cm best discriminated s. mitis from s. oralis. cm  bound the most infant salivary siga antibody and ptcw bound the least. in contrast, adult salivary siga antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. conclusions: presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary siga antibody that preferentially bind cm of s.  mitis but not ptcw. by utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of  antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary siga antibodies induced by oral colonization by s. mitis.

TI  == infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

TI  == evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == incidence and behaviour of tn916-like elements within tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from root canals.
AB  == introduction: tetracycline resistance is commonly found in endodontic bacteria. one of the most common tetracycline-resistance genes is tet(m), which is often encoded on the broad-host-range conjugative transposon tn916. this study aimed to determine whether tet(m) was present in bacteria isolated from endodontic patients at the eastman dental institute and whether this gene was carried on the transferable conjugative transposon tn916. methods: the cultivable microflora isolated from 15 endodontic patients was screened for resistance to tetracycline. polymerase chain reactions for tet(m) and for unique regions of tn916 were carried out on the dna of all tetracycline-resistant bacteria. filter-mating experiments were used to see if transfer of any tn916-like elements could occur.  results: eight out of 15 tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated were shown to possess tet(m). furthermore, four of these eight were shown to possess the tn916-unique regions linked to the tet(m) gene. transfer experiments demonstrated that a neisseria sp. donor could transfer an extremely unstable tn916-like element to enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: the tet(m) gene is present in the  majority of tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated in this study and the conjugative transposon tn916 has been shown to be responsible for the support and transfer of this gene in some of the bacteria isolated.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == humoral immunity to commensal oral bacteria in human infants: salivary secretory  immunoglobulin a antibodies reactive with streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis during the  first two years of life.
AB  == secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) antibodies reactive with the pioneer oral streptococci streptococcus mitis biovar 1 and streptococcus oralis, the late oral colonizer streptococcus mutans, and the pioneer enteric bacterium enterococcus faecalis in saliva samples from 10 human infants from birth to age 2 years were analyzed. low levels of salivary siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with whole cells of all four species were detected within the first month after birth, even  though s. mutans and e. faecalis were not recovered from the mouths of the infants during the study period. although there was a fivefold increase in the concentration of siga between birth and age 2 years, there were no differences between the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with the four species over this time period. when the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with all four species were normalized to the concentrations of siga1 and siga2 in saliva, siga1 and siga2 antibodies reactive with these bacteria showed a significant decrease from birth to 2 years of age. adsorption of each infant's saliva with cells of one species produced a dramatic reduction of antibodies recognizing the other three species. sequential adsorption of saliva samples removed all siga antibody to the bacteria, indicating that the siga antibodies were directed to antigens shared by all four species. the induction by the host of a limited immune response to common antigens that are likely not involved in adherence may be among the mechanisms that commensal streptococci employ to persist in the oral cavity.

TI  == detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, haemophilus and pathogenic neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  == the phosphorylcholine (pc) determinant in streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (c-ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (lta) (forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. western blotting with two pc specific  murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) designated 145,f-2 (igm) and 147,a-1 (iga) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis. purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the pc of lta. unlike other techniques, western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the pc epitope. gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the mabs. for this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. analyses by thin-layer  chromatography (tlc) detected the pc epitope in lipopolysaccharide (lps) fraction from h. influenzae. some strains of the neisseriaceae family were also positive by western blotting, but tlc and immunostaining did not detect the pc determinant in lps.

AB  == background: the evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in nacl esculin broth and group d antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the enterococcus genus were performed. methods: one hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 8 e. faecium, 3 e. avium, 16 streptococcus  intermedius, 7 s. salivarius, 4 s. bovis, 4 s. constellatus, 2 s. sanguis and 1 strain of s. equinus, s. mitis, s. uberis and s. mutans were studied. the tests used were: rapid test in nacl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup d streptococcus agglutination (patho dx strep d/pyr; diagnostic product corporation). all catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the enterococcus genus. the usefulness of gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. results: the results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. no significant differences were observed between the results obtained with gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the streptococcus mutans strain. conclusions: the application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group d agglutination and rapid test in nacl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the enterococcus genus.

TI  == rapid identification of streptococcus and enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  == diffuse reflectance-absorbance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, streptococcus bovis, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes. principal components analysis of the ft-ir spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six  separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their ft-ir spectra. by contrast, artificial neural networks (anns) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their ft-ir spectra. these results demonstrate that the combination of ft-ir and anns provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.

AB  == sixty-three strains of group d streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and api strep. streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. constellatus (s.  milleri). one of the two isolates of s. faecium was a contamination. the reported increasing frequency of this organism and other group d and viridans streptococci as well as the association of s. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the  need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (sat) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains  isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. in the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. the surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.
