TI  == preparation and antimicrobial action of three tryptic digested functional molecules of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an 80 kda bilobal, iron binding glycoprotein which is primarily antimicrobial in nature. the hydrolysis of lactoferrin by various proteases in the gut produces several functional fragments of lactoferrin which have varying molecular sizes and properties. here, bovine lactoferrin has been hydrolyzed by trypsin, the major enzyme present in the gut, to produce three functional molecules of sizes approximately 21 kda, 38 kda and 45 kda. the molecules have been purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and identified using n-terminal sequencing, which reveals that while the 21 kda molecule corresponds to the n2 domain (21lf), the 38 kda represents the whole c-lobe (38lf) and the 45 kda is a portion of n1 domain of n-lobe attached to the c-lobe  (45lf). the iron binding and release properties of 21lf, 38lf and 45lf have been  studied and compared. the sequence and structure analysis of the portions of the  excision sites of lf from various species have been done. the antibacterial properties of these three molecules against bacterial strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes were investigated. the antifungal action of the molecules was also evaluated against candida albicans. this is the first report on the antimicrobial actions of the trypsin cleaved functional molecules of lactoferrin from any species.

TI  == rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  == aims: to evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. methods and results: using greenlight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes,  salmonella typhimurium and listeria innocua) were analysed. for each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. conclusion: the microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. significance and impact of the study: the new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.

TI  == use of a dna microarray for detection and identification of bacterial pathogens associated with fishery products.
AB  == we established a microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of  diverse putative pathogens often associated with fishery products by targeting specific genes of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio  vulnificus, and yersinia enterocolitica and the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) region of proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. the microarray contained 26 specific probes and was tested against a total of 123 target bacterial strains that included 55 representative strains, 68 clinical isolates, and 45 strains of other bacterial species that belonged to 8 genera and 34 species, and it was shown to be specific and reproducible. a detection sensitivity of 10 ng dna or 10 cfu/ml for pure cultures of each target organism demonstrated that the assay was highly sensitive and reproducible. mock and real  fishery product samples were tested by the microarray, and the accuracy was 100%. the dna microarray method described in this communication is specific, sensitive, and reliable and has several advantages over traditional methods of bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination assays.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == high levels of igg class antibodies to recombinant hsp60 kda of yersinia enterocolitica in sera of patients with uveitis.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels of igg class antibodies to recombinant heat shock protein 60 kda of yersinia enterocolitica (rhsp60ye), klebsiella pneumoniae (rhsp60kp), escherichia coli (rhsp60ec), shigella flexneri (rhsp60sf), and streptococcus pyogenes (rhsp60sp) in the serum of patients with hla-b27 associated acute anterior uveitis (hla-b27 associated aau), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (idiopathic aau), pars planitis, vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh), and healthy subjects. methods: the genes that code for hsp60ye, hsp60kp, hsp60ec, hsp60sf, and hsp60sp were cloned by pcr from genomic dna. the rhsps were purified by affinity using a ni-nta resin. the serum levels of igg class antibodies to rhsp60s were determined by elisa in patients with uveitis (n = 42) and in healthy subjects (n = 25). results: the majority of patients with uveitis had higher levels of igg class antibodies to rhsp60ye compared with levels of healthy subjects (p = 0.01), although these differences were only observed in the hla-b27 associated aau (p = 0.005) and in pars planitis patients (p = 0.001). the levels  of igg antibodies to the rhsp60kp, rhsp60sf, rhsp60ec, and rhsp60sp were similar  in patients with uveitis and in healthy subjects (p>0.05). conclusion: the results suggest that hsp60ye could be involved in the aetiology of hla-b27 associated aau and pars planitis.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == host recognition and target differentiation by factor h, a regulator of the alternative pathway of complement.
AB  == factor h is responsible for recognition of host cells and tissues and mediates discrimination among microbial pathogens during activation of the alternative pathway of complement (ap). its unique structure of 20 scr domains arranged in a  flexible chain permits a variety of functional sites to interact with complement  proteins and surface markers in a biological example of single-molecule combinatorial chemistry. in addition to the complement regulatory site located in the n-terminal four scr domains, two other sites bind complement protein c3b and  three sites appear to recognize a variety of polyanions that serve as host markers. recent studies indicate that cooperativity among several c3b- and polyanion-binding sites influences the biological functions of factor h and that  the degree of influence of each site varies on different cells. the engagement of one or more of the host marker recognition sites enables factor h to control activation of the ap. the absence of host-like markers allows ap activation, but  many common pathogens have developed receptors for factor h or mimics of host markers of varying degrees of authenticity allowing them to escape detection by this innate defense system. organisms using one or more of these evasive techniques include neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus pyogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, trypanosoma cruzi, and the hiv virus.

TI  == insertion of a yop translocation pore into the macrophage plasma membrane by yersinia enterocolitica: requirement for translocators yopb and yopd, but not lcrg.
AB  == the yersinia survival strategy is based on its ability to inject effector yops into the cytosol of host cells. translocation of these effectors across the eukaryotic cell membrane requires yopb, yopd and lcrg, but the mechanism is unclear. an effector polymutant of y. pseudotuberculosis has a yopb-dependent contact haemolytic activity, indicating that yopb participates in the formation of a pore in the cell membrane. here, we have investigated the formation of such  a pore in the plasma membrane of macrophages. infection of pu5-1.8 macrophages with an effector polymutant y. enterocolitica led to complete flattening of the cells, similar to treatment with the pore-forming streptolysin o from streptococcus pyogenes. upon infection, cells released the low-molecular-weight marker bcecf (623 da) but not the high-molecular-weight lactate dehydrogenase, indicating that there was no membrane lysis but, rather, insertion of a pore of small size into the macrophage plasma membrane. permeation to lucifer yellow ch (443 da) but not to texas red-x phalloidin (1490 da) supported this hypothesis. all these events were found to be dependent not only on translocator yopb as expected but also on yopd, which was required equally. in contrast, lcrg was not  necessary. consistently, lysis of sheep erythrocytes was also dependent on yopb and yopd, but not on lcrg.

TI  == behcet's disease and antibody titers to various heat-shock protein 60s.
AB  == it has been suggested that the 65 kda heat-shock protein (hsp) of streptococcus in recurrent aphthae within the oral cavity may be involved in the uveoretinitis  of behcet's disease, possibly through sensitization of the immune system. to investigate this possibility, we examined serum antibody titers for various members of the 60 kda family of hsps and their implications with regard to a role for hsp60s in behcet's disease. we isolated hsp60 of streptococcus pyogenes from  the margin of oral aphthae in one behcet's disease patient with severe uveoretinitis and the hsp60s of yersinia enterocolitica, retinoblastoma cell line clone y79, and bovine retinal extract and investigated the reaction of each of these hsp60s with 100-fold diluted serum samples from 20 behcet's disease patients using anti-hsp60 antibody titers determined by elisa. the anti- streptococcus hsp60 antibody and anti-retinal hsp60 antibody titers of the 100-fold diluted serum samples from the behcet's disease patients were both significantly higher than those of similarly diluted serum samples from healthy donors. the results of the elisa antibody titer assay showed that, although the various hsp60s share a common basic antigenicity, they differed in reactivity to  the anti-hsp60 antibodies in the sera of the behcet's disease patients. the results indicate that subtle but significant differences exist in the antigenicity of the various hsp60s tested, all of which share a common basic antigenicity and are of approximately the same molecular weight, and suggest that an immuno-cross-reaction between retinal and streptococcal hsps and a related autoimmune response may be involved in the development of behcet's disease.

TI  == expression of mhc class ii molecules on human monocytes is regulated independently from each other after phagocytosis of bacteria.
AB  == reactive arthritis is usually self-limiting polyarthritis which develops in hla-b27 positive individuals after certain gastrointestinal or urogenital infections. the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis is unknown but t cells seem to have a crucial role. most of the antigen-specific t cells isolated from the synovial fluid have been mhc class ii restricted. the role of antigen presentation in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis has been studied relatively little. in this work the authors studied the effect of arthritis-triggering bacterium (yersinia enterocolitica o:3) on the expression of mhc class ii molecules on human monocytes and found that the expression of different mhc class ii molecules was regulated independently from each other in half of the individuals after certain incubation periods. in these cases the expression of hla-dp was parallel to the expression of hla-dq, while hla-dr expression went to the opposite direction or did not change at all. no difference between hla-b27 negative and hla-b27 positive healthy individuals was seen. the authors conclude that independent regulation of the expression of different mhc class ii antigens on antigen-presenting cells is a more common phenomenon than usually thought.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == mhc-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.
AB  == a cd8+ alpha beta tcr+ t cell clone (a35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by yersinia enterocolitica. this clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. there was no restriction by polymorphic parts of hla-a, -b, or -c molecules and a hla class ii-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected hla class i-deficient cells (daudi cells) were not. the clone showed crossreaction between yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with staphylococcus epidermidis. mab to cd2, cd3, and cd8 efficiently blocked a35, whereas the addition of mab to hla class ii or to hla class i did not. this clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.

TI  == use of recombinant interleukin-2 to enhance adoptive transfer of resistance to listeria monocytogenes infection.
AB  == in vitro incubation of listeria-immune spleen cells (lisc) with recombinant interleukin-2 (ril-2) for at least 3 days increased their ability to transfer antilisteria resistance to recipient mice. this effect was blocked by the in vitro addition of transforming growth factor beta 1. the level of protection afforded by the transfer of ril-2-incubated lisc was further elevated by the in vivo administration of ril-2 at a dose that by itself did not significantly increase antilisteria resistance. the antilisteria resistance of recipient mice remained elevated for approximately 7 days and then rapidly declined to undetectable levels by 10 days. after cell transfer, recipient mice were protected against challenge with listeria monocytogenes but not salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, or streptococcus pyogenes. flow cytometric  analyses revealed an increase in the percentages of cd8+, nk+, and gamma delta t  cell receptor+ cells but no change in the percentage of cd4+ cells as a result of lisc coculturing with ril-2. in vitro depletion of cd4+ cells just prior to transfer had no significant effect on the adoptive transfer of resistance; depletion of cd8+ cells reduced the level of resistance by approximately 25%. combined depletion of thy-1.2+, cd4+, and cd8+ cells just prior to adoptive transfer diminished the level of protection in the spleens but not the livers of  recipient mice. these data suggest that ril-2 can be used to augment adoptive immunotherapy for bacterial infection in a manner similar to adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer patients. although the protective cell population was not definitively identified, it appeared to be independent of cd4+ cells and  only partly dependent on cd8+ cells.

AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.
