TI  == oral administration of heparin or heparosan increases the lactobacillus population in gut microbiota of rats.
AB  == heparin and heparosan have been confirmed to be effective blockers in inhibiting  adhesion of pathogens in vitro. however, their effects on gut microbiota in vivo  remain unknown. here we have studied the effects of oral administration of heparin or heparosan on gut microbiota in rats by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). results showed that  the predominant bacterial communities in the feces of heparin- or heparosan-treated animals were different from those of the saline-treated animals, with increased lactobacillus spp. and decreased enterococcus sp. different dgge banding patterns were also observed for the subpopulations of lactobacillus and bacteroides groups. in conclusion, heparin or heparosan may be  used as an effective gut microbiota modulator by increasing the subpopulation of  lactobacillus.

TI  == characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  == foot and mouth disease (fmd) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by aphthovirus. when fmd is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in korea. after the fmd incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they  live. this is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. in this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with dna extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with a genomic dna. our results revealed that bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and  sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. during the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, clostridium cochlearium, fusobacterium ulcerans, and fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. in addition, various microbes such as turicibacter sanguinis, clostridium haemolyticum, bacteroides propionicifaciens, and comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). in particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a  long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. it  is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for fmd-infected animals.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == effects of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of difructose anhydride iii (di-d-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; dfa iii) administration (3% dfa iii for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to dgge profiles, the number of bacteria related to bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and ruminococcus productus increased  in dfa iii-fed rat cecum. in the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats, a lowering of ph and an increase in short chain fatty acids (scfas), especially acetic acid, were observed. the dfa iii-assimilating bacterium, ruminococcus sp. m-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats. the strain had 98% similarity with r. productus atcc 27340t (l76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. these results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by dfa iii administration. moreover, dfa iii stimulated the growth of ruminococcus sp. m-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. it is expected that dfa iii would be  a new candidate as a prebiotic.

TI  == [effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  == aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens  (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). the predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 b  fragilis group and seven b melaninogenicus group), gram-positive anaerobic cocci  (15), fusobacterium sp (six), and clostridium sp (three). the predominant aerobic organisms were escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group a  beta-hemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus morganii (two of each). five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. incision and drainage were performed on  all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
