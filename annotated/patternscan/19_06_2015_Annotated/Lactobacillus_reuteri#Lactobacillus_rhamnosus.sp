TI  == transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel in rodents is a major target for antinociceptive effect of the probiotic l. reuteri dsm 17938.
AB  == certain bacteria exert visceral antinociceptive activity, but the mechanisms involved are not determined. lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 was examined since it may be antinociceptive in children. since transient receptor potential vanilloid (trpv1) channel activity may mediate nociceptive signals we hypothesised that trpv1 current is inhibited by dsm. we tested this by examining  the effect of dsm on the firing frequency of spinal nerve fibres in murine jejunal mesenteric nerve bundles following serosal application of capsaicin. we also measured the effects of dsm on capsaicin-evoked increase in intracellular ca2+ or ionic current in dorsal root ganglia neurons (drg). furthermore, we tested the in vivo antinociceptive effects of oral dsm on gastric distension in rats. live dsm reduced the response of capsaicin- and distension-evoked firing of spinal nerve action potentials (238 +/- 27.5% vs. 129 +/- 17%). dsm also reduced  the capsaicin-evoked trpv1 ionic current in drg neuronal primary culture from 83  +/- 11% to 41 +/- 8% of the initial response to capsaicin only. another lactobacillus (lactobacillus rhamnosus jb-1) with known visceral anti-nociceptive activity did not have these effects. dsm also inhibited capsaicin-evoked ca2+ increase in drg neurons; an increase in ca2+ fluorescence intensity ratio of 2.36 +/- 0.31 evoked by capsaicin was reduced to 1.25 +/- 0.04). dsm releasable products (conditioned medium) mimicked dsm inhibition of capsaicin-evoked excitability. the trpv1 antagonist (6-iodonordihydrocapsaicin) or the use of trpv1 knock-out mice revealed that trpv1 channels mediate about 80% of the inhibitory effect of dsm on mesenteric nerve response to high intensity gut distention. finally, feeding with dsm inhibited perception in rats of painful gastric distension. our results identify a specific target channel for a probiotic with potential therapeutic properties. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == in vitro modulation of probiotic bacteria on the biofilm of candida glabrata.
AB  == a conspicuous new concept of pathogens living as the microbial societies in the human host rather than free planktonic cells has raised considerable concerns among scientists and clinicians. fungal biofilms are communities of cells that possess distinct characteristic such as increased resistance to the immune defence and antimycotic agents in comparison to their planktonic cells counterpart. therefore, inhibition of the biofilm may represent a new paradigm for antifungal development. in this study, we aim to evaluate the in vitro modulation of vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc)-causing candida glabrata biofilms using probiotic lactobacilli strains. probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and  lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 were shown to have completely inhibited c. glabrata biofilms and the results were corroborated by scanning electron microscopy (sem), which revealed scanty structures of the mixed biofilms of c. glabrata and probiotic lactobacilli strains. in addition, biofilm-related c. glabrata genes epa6 and yak1 were downregulated in response to the probiotic lactobacilli challenges. the present study suggested that probiotic l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 strains inhibited c. glabrata biofilm by partially impeding the adherence of yeast cells and the effect might be contributed by the secretory compounds produced by these probiotic lactobacilli strains. further investigations are required to examine and identify the biofilm inhibitory compounds and the mechanism of probiotic actions of these lactobacilli strains.

TI  == biochemical analysis of respiratory metabolism in the heterofermentative lactobacillus spicheri and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == aims: this study evaluated the aerobic and respiratory metabolism in lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus spicheri, two heterofermentative species  used in sourdough fermentation. methods and results: in silico genome analysis, production of metabolites and gene expression of pyruvate oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were assessed in anaerobic and aerobic cultures of l. reuteri and l. spicheri. respiring homofermentative l. casei n87 and l. rhamnosus n132 were used for comparison. aerobiosis and respiration increased the biomass production of heterofermentative strains compared to anaerobic cultivation. respiration led to acetoin production by l. rhamnosus and  l. casei, but not in heterofermentative strains, in which lactate and acetate were the major end-products. l. spicheri lp38 showed the highest oxygen uptake. pyruvate oxidase, respiratory cytochromes, nadh-oxidase and nadh-peroxidase were  present in the genome of l. spicheri lp38. both l. spicheri lp38 and l. rhamnosus n132 overexpressed pox in aerobic cultures, while cyda was up-regulated only when heme was supplied; pdh was repressed during aerobic growth. conclusions: aerobic  and respiratory growth provided physiological and metabolic advantages also in heterofermentative lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: the exploitation of oxygen-tolerant phenotypes of l. spicheri may be useful for the development of improved starter cultures. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase functions in adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == this study was aimed to identify key surface proteins mediating the adhesion of lactobacilli to intestinal epithelial cells. by using caco-2 and ipec-j2 cells labeled with sulfo-nhs-biotin in the western blotting, a protein band of an approximately 37 kda was detected on the surface layer of lactobacillus reuteri strains zj616, zj617, zj621, and zj623 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. mass spectrometry analysis using the adhesion-related protein from l. reuteri zj617 showed that it was 100% homologous to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) of l. reuteri jcm 1112 (genbank: yp_001841377). the ability of l. reuteri zj617 to adhere to epithelial cells decreased significantly by treatment with licl or by blocking with an anti-gapdh antibody, in comparison with the untreated strain (p < 0.05). immunoelectron microscopic and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that gapdh is located on the surface layer  of l. reuteri zj617. the results indicated that the gapdh protein of l. reuteri zj617 acts as an adhesion component that plays an important role in binding to the intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was  further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical  resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the  results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 exhibit strong antifungal effects against vulvovaginal candidiasis-causing candida glabrata isolates.
AB  == aims: this study investigates the antagonistic effects of the probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 against vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc)-causing candida glabrata. methods and results: growth inhibitory activities of lact. rhamnosus gr-1 and lact. reuteri rc-14 strains against c. glabrata were demonstrated using a spot overlay assay and a plate-based microtitre assay. in addition, these probiotic lactobacilli strains also exhibited potent candidacidal activity against c. glabrata, as demonstrated  by a live/dead yeast viability assay performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. the metabolic activities of all c. glabrata strains were completely shut down in response to the challenges by the probiotic lactobacilli strains. in addition, both probiotic lactobacilli strains exhibited strong autoaggregation and coaggregation phenotypes in the presence of c. glabrata, which indicate that  these lactobacilli strains may exert their probiotic effects through the formation of aggregates and, thus the consequent prevention of colonization by c. glabrata. conclusions: probiotic lact. rhamnosus gr-1 and lact. reuteri rc-14 strains exhibited potent antagonistic activities against all of the tested c. glabrata strains. these lactobacilli exhibited antifungal effects, including those attributed to their aggregation abilities, and their presence caused the cessation of growth and eventual cell death of c. glabrata. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study to report on the antagonistic effects of these probiotic lactobacilli strains against the non-candida albicans  candida (ncac) species c. glabrata.

TI  == inhibitory effects of different lactobacilli on candida albicans hyphal formation and biofilm development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different species of lactobacilli on hyphal formation and biofilm development by the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans. we employed 4 different lactobacillus species,  namely l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. reuteri, and 2 c. albicans strains, the reference day286 and its isogenic hwp1/hwp1 mutant, the fjs24 strain. as assessed by morphological analysis and quantitative colorimetric assays, lactobacillus crude filtrate supernatant fluids (cfsf) affected candida,  impairing both hyphal formation and biofilm production. the cfsf-mediated phenomenon occurred in a dilution- and time-dependent manner and was consistently observed, irrespective of the c. albicans hwp1 genotype.

TI  == inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  == clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral candida species. sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and candida was also assessed. agar overlay assay was utilised  to study growth inhibition of candida albicans, candida glabrata and candida krusei by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus  reuteri sd2112, lactobacillus brevis cd2, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb86 and l. bulgaricus lb lact. the inhibitory effect was measured at ph 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). growth and final ph values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. l. rhamnosus gg showed the  strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against c. albicans, followed by l. casei shirota, l. reuteri sd2112 and l. brevis cd2. none of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of c. krusei. only l. rhamnosus gg produced slight inhibitory effect on c. glabrata. the lower ph values led to larger inhibition zones. sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains.  l. casei shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas l. brevis cd2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. all candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with c. glabrata. the results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different ph values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower ph.

TI  == immunomodulation of monocytes by probiotic and selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, are recognized as common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and have received considerable attention in the last decades due to their postulated health-promoting effects. lab and probiotic bacteria can modulate the  host immune response. however, much is unknown about the mediators and mechanisms responsible for their immunological effect. here, we present a study using cytokine secretion from the monocytic cell line thp-1 and nf-kappab activation in the monocytic cell line u937-3xkb-luc to elucidate immune stimulating abilities of lab in vitro. in this study, we investigate both commercially available and potential probiotic lab strains, and the role of putative surface proteins of l.  reuteri using mutants. l. reuteri strains induced the highest cytokine secretion  and the highest nf-kappab activation, whereas l. plantarum strains and l. rhamnosus gg were low inducers/activators. one of the putative l. reuteri surface proteins, hmpref0536_10802, appeared to be of importance for the stimulation of thp-1 cells and the activation of nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells. live and uv-inactivated preparations resulted in different responses for two of the strains investigated. our results add to the complexity in the interaction between lab and human cells and suggest the possible involvement of secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of lab. it is likely that it is the sum of bacterial surface proteins and bacterial metabolites and/or secreted proteins that induce cytokine secretion in thp-1 cells and activate nf-kappab in u937-3xkb-luc cells in this study.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == phenotypic surface properties (aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation) and presence of related genes in beneficial vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the phenotypic expression of auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation of lactobacilli isolated from human vagina and the presence of related genes. methods and results: seven different strains of three  lactobacillus species (lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri) were evaluated. the auto-aggregation property was determined by spectrophotometric assay and flow cytometry. adhesion and biofilm formation were assayed by crystal violet staining. the presence of the genes encoding sortases, pilin subunits and surface proteins was evaluated by polymerase chain reactions. the two lact. reuteri strains assayed showed high auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation ability. in these strains, the genes encoding three adhesion proteins were identified. in lact. rhamnosus crl (centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection) 1332, pilus-encoding genes were detected. in all lact. rhamnosus strains assayed, two genes encoding for other surface proteins related to adhesion and biofilm formation were detected. conclusions: the vaginal lactobacilli assayed exhibited  phenotypic and genetic characteristics that were specific for each strain. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study on auto-aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation of vaginal lactobacillus strains by phenotypic and genetic assays.

TI  == a systems biology approach investigating the effect of probiotics on the vaginal  microbiome and host responses in a double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of post-menopausal women.
AB  == a lactobacilli dominated microbiota in most pre and post-menopausal women is an indicator of vaginal health. the objective of this double blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study was to evaluate in 14 post-menopausal women with an intermediate nugent score, the effect of 3 days of vaginal administration of probiotic l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (2.5x109 cfu each) on the microbiota and host response. the probiotic treatment did not result in an improved nugent score when compared to when placebo. analysis using 16s rrna sequencing and metabolomics profiling revealed that the relative abundance of lactobacillus was increased following probiotic administration as compared to placebo, which was weakly associated with an increase in lactate levels. a decrease in atopobium was also observed. analysis of host responses by microarray showed the probiotics had an immune-modulatory response including effects on pattern recognition receptors such as tlr2 while also affecting epithelial barrier function. this is the first study to use an interactomic approach for the study of vaginal probiotic administration in post-menopausal women. it shows that in some cases multifaceted approaches are required to detect the subtle molecular changes induced by the host to instillation of probiotic strains. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02139839.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == use of probiotics for management of acute gastroenteritis: a position paper by the espghan working group for probiotics and prebiotics.
AB  == the use of probiotics has been suggested in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis (age) in addition to early rehydration and avoidance of dietary restrictions. this document provides recommendations for the use of probiotics for the treatment of age in previously healthy infants and children based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic reviews and of randomized controlled trials (rcts) published subsequently to these reviews. the recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 rcts that used a given probiotic (with strain specification) were available. the grade system developed  by the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations working group, was used to grade the strength of evidence and grades of recommendations used in these guidelines. it offers 4 categories of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) and 2 categories of the strength of recommendation (strong or weak). the use of the following probiotics  (in alphabetical order) may be considered in the management of children with age  in addition to rehydration therapy: lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation) and saccharomyces boulardii (low quality of evidence, strong recommendation). less compelling evidence is available for lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation) and heat-inactivated lactobacillus acidophilus lb (very low quality of evidence, weak recommendation). the latter, although traditionally discussed with other probiotics, does not fit with the definition of probiotics.  other strains or combinations of strains have been tested, but evidence of their  efficacy is weak or preliminary.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == management strategies in the treatment of neonatal and pediatric gastroenteritis.
AB  == acute gastroenteritis, characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in mostly resource-constrained nations. although generally a mild and self-limiting  disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and  is associated with a substantial disease burden. worldwide, up to 40% of children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are hospitalized with rotavirus. also, some  microorganisms have been found predominantly in resource-constrained nations, including shigella spp, vibrio cholerae, and the protozoan infections. prevention remains essential, and the rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials. because dehydration is the major complication associated with gastroenteritis, appropriate fluid management (oral  or intravenous) is an effective and safe strategy for rehydration. continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended. new treatments such as antiemetics (ondansetron), some antidiarrheal agents (racecadotril), and chemotherapeutic agents are often proposed, but not yet universally recommended. probiotics, also  known as "food supplement," seem to improve intestinal microbial balance, reducing the duration and the severity of acute infectious diarrhea. the european society for paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the european society of paediatric infectious diseases guidelines make a stronger recommendation for the use of probiotics for the management of acute gastroenteritis, particularly those with documented efficacy such as lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri, and saccharomyces boulardii. to date, the management of acute gastroenteritis has been based on the option of  "doing the least": oral rehydration-solution administration, early refeeding, no  testing, no unnecessary drugs.

AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == lactobacillus decelerates cervical epithelial cell cycle progression.
AB  == we investigated cell cycle progression in epithelial cervical me-180 cells during colonization of three different lactobacillus species utilizing live cell microscopy, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, and flow cytometry. the colonization of these me-180 cells by l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri, originating from human gastric epithelia and saliva, respectively, was shown to reduce cell cycle progression and to cause host cells to accumulate in the g1 phase of the cell cycle. the g1 phase accumulation in l. rhamnosus-colonized cells was accompanied by the up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of p21. by contrast, the vaginal isolate l. crispatus did not affect cell cycle progression. furthermore, both the supernatants from the lactic acid-producing l. rhamnosus colonies and lactic acid added to cell culture media were able to reduce the proliferation of me-180 cells. in this study, we reveal the diversity of the lactobacillus species to affect host cell cycle progression and demonstrate that  l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exert anti-proliferative effects on human cervical carcinoma cells.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == spatiotemporal maps reveal regional differences in the effects on gut motility for lactobacillus reuteri and rhamnosus strains.
AB  == background: commensal bacteria such as probiotics that are neuroactive acutely affect the amplitudes of intestinal migrating motor complexes (mmcs). what is lacking for an improved understanding of these motility effects are region specific measurements of velocity and frequency. we have combined intraluminal pressure recordings with spatiotemporal diameter maps to analyze more completely  effects of different strains of beneficial bacteria on motility. methods: intraluminal peak pressure (ppr) was measured and video recordings made of mouse  ex vivo jejunum and colon segments before and after intraluminal applications of  lactobacillus rhamnosus (jb-1) or lactobacillus reuteri (dsm 17938). migrating motor complex frequency and velocity were calculated. key results: jb-1 decreased jejunal frequencies by 56% and 34% in colon. jejunal velocities increased 171%, but decreased 31% in colon. jejunal ppr decreased by 55% and in colon by 21%. dsm 17938 increased jejunal frequencies 63% and in colon 75%; jejunal velocity decreased 57%, but increased in colon 146%; jejunal ppr was reduced 26% and 12% in colon. tram-34 decreased frequency by 71% and increased velocity 200% for jejunum, but increased frequency 46% and velocity 50% for colon; ppr was decreased 59% for jejunum and 39% for colon. conclusions & inferences: the results show that probiotics and other beneficial bacteria have strain and region-specific actions on gut motility that can be successfully discriminated using spatiotemporal mapping of diameter changes. effects are not necessarily the same in colon and jejunum. further research is needed on the detailed effects of  the strains on enteric neuron currents for each gut region.

AB  == candida albicans is the most important candida species causing vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc). vvc has significant medical and economical impact on women's health and wellbeing. while current antifungal treatment is reasonably effective, supportive and preventive measures such as application of probiotics are required to reduce the incidence of vvc. we investigated the potential of the probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 towards control of c. albicans. in vitro experiments demonstrated that lactic acid at low ph plays a major role in suppressing fungal growth. viability staining following cocultures  with lactobacilli revealed that c. albicans cells lost metabolic activity and eventually were killed. transcriptome analyses showed increased expression of stress-related genes and lower expression of genes involved in fluconazole resistance, which might explain the increased eradication of candida in a previous clinical study on conjoint probiotic therapy. our results provide insights on the impact of probiotics on c. albicans survival.

TI  == lactobacilli vs antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections: a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: growing antibiotic resistance warrants studying nonantibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis). use of lactobacilli appears to be promising. methods: between january 2005 and august 2007, we randomized 252 postmenopausal women with recurrent utis taking part in a double-blind noninferiority trial to receive 12 months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 480 mg, once daily or oral capsules containing 109 colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 twice daily. primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic utis, proportion of participants with at least 1 uti during 12 months, time to first uti, and development of antibiotic resistance by escherichia coli. results: the mean number of symptomatic utis in the year preceding randomization was 7.0 in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 6.8 in the lactobacilli group. in the intention-to-treat analysis, after 12 months of prophylaxis, these numbers were 2.9 and 3.3, respectively. the between-treatment difference of 0.4 utis per year  (95% ci, -0.4 to 1.5) was outside our noninferiority margin. at least 1 symptomatic uti occurred in 69.3% and 79.1% of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  and lactobacilli participants, respectively; median times to the first uti were 6 and 3 months, respectively. after 1 month of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin had increased from approximately 20% to 40% to approximately 80% to 95% in e coli from the feces and urine of asymptomatic women and among e coli causing a uti. during the 3 months after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole discontinuation, resistance levels gradually decreased. resistance did not increase during lactobacilli prophylaxis. conclusions: in postmenopausal women with recurrent utis, l rhamnosus gr-1 and l reuteri rc-14 do not meet the noninferiority criteria in the prevention of utis when compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. however, unlike trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, lactobacilli do not increase antibiotic resistance. trial registration isrctn.org identifier: isrctn50717094.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus and estrogen effects on vaginal epithelial gene expression responses to candida albicans.
AB  == background: vaginal epithelial cells have receptors, signal transduction mechanisms, and cytokine secretion capabilities to recruit host defenses against  candida albicans infections. this research evaluates how probiotic lactobacilli affect the defensive epithelial response. methods: this study used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (qrt-pcr), flow cytometry,  and a multiplex immunoassay to observe changes in the regulation of gene expression related to cytokine responses in the vk2 (e6/e7) vaginal epithelial cell line treated with 17beta-estradiol, exposed to probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1(r) and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14(r) and challenged with c. albicans. data were statistically evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t-tests where appropriate. results: c. albicans induced mrna  expression of genes related to inflammatory cytokine responses associated with nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction pathways. 17beta-estradiol suppressed expression of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha), il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) mrna. probiotic lactobacilli suppressed c. albicans-induced nuclear factor-kappa b inhibitor kinase kinase alpha (ikappakappaalpha), toll-like receptor-2 (tlr2), tlr6, il-8, and tnfalpha, also suggesting inhibition of nf-kappab signaling. the lactobacilli induced expression of il-1alpha, and il-1beta mrna, which was not inhibited by curcumin, suggesting that they induce an alternate inflammatory signal transduction pathway to nf-kappab, such as the mitogen activated protein kinase and activator protein-1 (mapk/ap-1) signal transduction pathway. curcumin inhibited il-13 secretion, suggesting that expression of this cytokine is mainly regulated by nf-kappab signaling in vk2 cells. conclusions: the results suggest that c. albicans infection induces pro-inflammatory responses in vaginal epithelial cells, and estrogen and lactobacilli suppress expression of nf-kappab-related inflammatory genes. probiotic lactobacilli may induce il-1alpha and il-1beta expression by an alternate signal transduction pathway, such as mapk/ap-1. activation of alternate signaling mechanisms by lactobacilli to modify epithelial cell cytokine production may be a mechanism for probiotic modulation of morbidity in vulvovaginal candidiasis.

AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

AB  == recent studies have suggested that the topical application of probiotic bacteria  can improve skin health or combat disease. we have utilized a primary human keratinocyte culture model to investigate whether probiotic bacteria can inhibit  staphylococcus aureus infection. evaluation of the candidate probiotics lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730, lactobacillus rhamnosus ac413, and lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 demonstrated that both l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus, but not l. salivarius, reduced s. aureus-induced keratinocyte cell death in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. keratinocyte survival was significantly higher if the probiotic was applied prior to (p < 0.01) or simultaneously with (p < 0.01) infection with s. aureus but not when added after infection had commenced (p > 0.05). the protective effect of l. reuteri was not dependent on the elaboration of inhibitory substances such as lactic acid. l. reuteri inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion (p = 0.026). l. salivarius ucc118, however, did not inhibit s. aureus from adhering to keratinocytes (p > 0.05) and did not protect keratinocyte viability. s. aureus utilizes the alpha5beta1 integrin to adhere to  keratinocytes, and blocking of this integrin resulted in a protective effect similar to that observed with probiotics (p = 0.03). this suggests that the protective mechanism for l. reuteri-mediated protection of keratinocytes was by competitive exclusion of the pathogen from its binding sites on the cells. our results suggest that use of a topical probiotic prophylactically could inhibit the colonization of skin by s. aureus and thus aid in the prevention of infection.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == the influence of probiotics on the cervical malignancy diagnostics quality.
AB  == background/aim: probiotics help to provide an optimum balance in the intestines.  probiotics species competitive block toxic substances and growth of unwanted bacteria and yeast species while they compete for the space and food. lactogyn is the first oral probiotics on serbian market dedicated to maintaining a normal vaginal flora. lactogyn contains two well studied probiotics strains - lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14. both of them are considered as probiotic agents with therapeutic properties increase the population of beneficial lactobacillus organisms within the vagina. the aim of this study was to exam an influence of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 on results of cervical smear cytological testing including detection of atypical cells, detection of false positive and false negative findings as well as on vaginal microflora content in patients with vaginal infection signs and symptoms. methods: totally 250 women with signs of vaginal infection were selected to participate in the study. the study group comprised 125 patients taking studied probiotic strains along with specific anti-infective therapy. the control group comprised, also, 125 patients taking anti-infective agents, only. probiotic preparation (lactogyn capsules) was administered orally (one capsule daily) during 4 weeks. before and six weeks after beginning of the therapy a cervical smear cytological test (the papanicolaou test), as well as microbiological examination of the vaginal smear were performed. results: number of cases of inflammation and atypical squamous cells of undeterminated significance (ascus) in the study group were significantly higher before administration of the probiotic preparation. the number of lactobacilli was significantly higher, and the number of pathogenic microorganisms lower in the group treated with this preparation. conclusion: the  application of probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 concomitantly with specific anti-infective agents provides more reliable cytological diagnostics, reduces the number of false positive and false  negative findings on cervical malignancy and normalizes vaginal microflora in higher percentage of patients with vaginal infections comapred with therapy including antiinfective agents only.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == short-term consumption of probiotic lactobacilli has no effect on acid production of supragingival plaque.
AB  == acidogenicity and the levels of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental plaque after the use of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and lactobacillus reuteri were determined. the study had a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. thirteen  volunteers used tablets containing lgg or a combination of l. reuteri sd2112 and  pta 5289 for 2 weeks. at baseline and at the end of each tablet period, all available supragingival plaque was collected. lactic acid production was determined from a fixed volume (8 mul) of fresh plaque and the rest of the plaque was used for culturing ms and lactobacilli. the retention of probiotics to the plaque was assessed using pcr techniques. no probiotic-induced changes were found in the acidogenicity of plaque. also, ms counts remained at the original level. the number of subjects with lactobacilli in plaque increased in the l. reuteri group (p = 0.011) but not in the lgg group. pcr analysis of plaque revealed the presence of lgg in four and l. reuteri in six subjects after the use of the probiotic. the use of the lactobacilli did not affect the acidogenicity or ms levels of plaque. short-term consumption of lgg and l. reuteri appeared not to influence the acidogenicity of plaque.

TI  == effect of 25 weeks probiotic supplementation on immune function of hiv patients.
AB  == introduction: studies with a follow-up of < 8 weeks have indicated immune-preserving effects of yogurt probiotic supplementation among hiv patients. to evaluate the impact of 25 weeks use of probiotics, a randomized, double blind, controlled study was undertaken on 65 women who were naive to anti-retroviral treatment. results: ten participants were excluded post-randomization due to non-eligibility. thirty participants were assigned placebo, of whom 25 completed  the study versus 19 of 25 completing the study in the probiotics group (p = 0.5). from baseline to 10 weeks follow-up, the cd4 count declined on average 3 cd4 cells/mul (95% confidence interval: -97; 91) with placebo versus an increase of 50 cells/mul (95% ci: -61; 162) with probiotics (p = 0.5). from baseline to 25 weeks, the cd4 count increased with 19 cells/mul (95% ci: -90; 129) in the placebo group versus 46 cells/mul (95% ci: -100; 192) with probiotics (p = 0.8).  no differences in immune markers, diarrhea incidence or adverse events were observed. discussion: lactobacillus gr-1 and rc-14 may be safely consumed at 2 x  10(9) cfu/day by moderately immune compromised hiv patients but this did not universally preserve immune-function. patients and methods: women were randomized to receive oral capsules containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (2 x 10(9) colony forming units) or placebo twice daily for 25 weeks. the cd4 count and immune markers (igg, ige, ifngamma and il-10) were measured at baseline and during follow-up, the occurrence of diarrhea was reported daily.

TI  == a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study of probiotics in active rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: to examine the effect of probiotics as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). a sample size of 30 subjects was calculated to determine a moderate effect. material/methods: a three month double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed using probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 capsules administered orally. inclusion criteria required at least 4 swollen and 4 tender  joints and stable medications with no steroids for at least 1 month prior to and  during the study. twenty-nine patients with ra were randomized to treatment. acr20 responses, serum cytokine levels and safety parameters were assessed. results: fifteen patients were randomized to the probiotic group, and 14 to placebo. three subjects in the probiotic (20%) and one in the placebo group (7%)  achieved an acr20 response (p= 0.33). there was no statistically significant difference between individual components of the acr20 criteria. changes in cytokines favored placebo over probiotic. there was a significant improvement in  the health assessment questionnaire (haq) score in the probiotic group from visit 1 to visit 3 (p=0.02) but no between-group differences. conclusions: due to inclusion criteria, patients selected for the study had stable ra with chronic synovitis, and thus it may have been difficult for an adjunctive therapy to demonstrate improvement within 3 months. although probiotics did not clinically improve ra as measured by the acr20, it is interesting that there was functional  improvement seen within the probiotic group compared to placebo.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == co-aggregation and growth inhibition of probiotic lactobacilli and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

AB  == diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in westernized communities. the development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. the present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific lactobacillus species and genetic variations in dc-sign, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) and sensitization in infancy. within the koala birth cohort study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five lactobacillus species: l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri. eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the dc-sign gene were genotyped in these children. allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of ad and sensitization (specific ige) at age 2 years. l. rhamnosus (31.5 %), l. paracasei  (31.3 %) and l. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas l. casei (2.5 %) and l. reuteri (<1 %)  were rare. colonization with l. paracasei decreased the risk of ad significantly  (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of l. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). two dc-sign polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. the present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in dc-sign in association with  the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 to prevent or cure bacterial vaginosis among women with hiv.
AB  == objective: to assess, among women with hiv, whether long-term oral lactobacillus  rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 supplementation can prevent bacterial vaginosis (bv) and enhance the cure rate of metronidazole among those with bv. methods: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted  among 65 hiv-infected women with an aberrant microbiota (nugent score 4-10) who were randomized to receive daily probiotics or placebo for 6 months. those with bv (nugent score 7-10) additionally received metronidazole for 10 days (400 mg twice daily). results: we did not find an enhanced cure rate of bv among women with hiv treated with adjuvant probiotics to metronidazole treatment. among women with an intermediate vaginal flora, probiotics tended to increase the probability of a normal vaginal flora (odds ratio 2.4; p=0.1) and significantly increased the probability of a beneficial vaginal ph (odds ratio 3.8; p=0.02) at follow-up. conclusion: supplementation of probiotic l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 did not enhance the cure of bv among women living with hiv, but may prevent the condition among this population. trial registration: nct00536848.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial activity of probiotic bacteria against salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium 1344 in a common medium under different environmental conditions.
AB  == the importance of probiotics in human nutrition has been gaining recognition in recent years. these organisms have been shown to promote human health by enhancing immunological and digestive functions and fighting respiratory tract infections. we propose an improved in vitro model for the study of probiotic antimicrobial activity against enteropathogens, by attempting to re-create, in a  common culture medium, environmental growth conditions comparable to those present in the small intestine. a preliminary experiment was carried out in order to find a culture medium able to support both probiotics and pathogens. this was  done with the aim of obtaining correct assessment of the interaction under shared growth conditions. bhi medium was selected as the common culture medium and was therefore used in antimicrobial activity assays. the interactions between salmonella 1344 and lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri were then assessed at different ph and oxygen availability conditions mimicking the small intestinal environment. l. rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 (lgg) had the strongest antimicrobial effect, in particular under anaerobic conditions and at lower ph levels. its antagonistic activity involved both lactic acid and secreted non-lactic acid molecules. our findings suggest that each probiotic strain has an optimum range of action and should therefore be thoroughly investigated to optimize its use.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == randomized controlled trial of probiotics for the prevention of spontaneous preterm delivery associated with intrauterine infection: study protocol.
AB  == background: spontaneous preterm deliveries that occur before the 34th week of gestation, and particularly before the 32nd week of gestation, have been strongly associated to intrauterine infection, ascending from vagina, and represent the largest portion of neonatal deaths and neurological problems. bacterial vaginosis, characterized by a diminished or absent flora of lactobacilli and increased colonization of several anaerobic or facultative microorganisms, increases two times the risk of preterm delivery before the 34th week. trials of  antibiotics failed to show efficacy and effectiveness against spontaneous preterm birth related to bacterial vaginosis. some studies indicate benefit from selected probiotics to treat genitourinary infections, including bacterial vaginosis. objective: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the early administration of selected probiotics to pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis/intermediate degree infection to reduce the occurrence of spontaneous preterm delivery and related neonatal mortality and morbidity. methods/design: women attending public prenatal care services in rio de janeiro will be screened to select asymptomatic pregnant women, less than 20 weeks' gestation, with no indication of elective preterm delivery. those with vaginal ph > = 4.5 and a nugent score between 4 and 10 (intermediate degree infection or bacterial vaginosis) will be randomized to either the placebo or the intervention group, after written informed consent. intervention consists in the use of probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14, 2 capsules a day, each capsule containing more than one million bacilli of each strain, for 6-12 weeks, up to the 24th-25th wk of gestation. ancillary analyses include quantification of selected cervicovaginal cytokines and genotyping of selected polymorphisms. the randomization process is stratified for history of preterm delivery and blocked. allocation concealment was designed as well as blinding of women, caregivers and outcome evaluators. the study will be supervised by an independent monitoring committee. outcomes under study are preterm delivery (< 34- < 32 weeks of gestation) and associated neonatal complications: early neonatal sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and prematurity-related retinopathy; definitions were adapted from those recommended by the 2002 version of the vermont-oxford network. trial registration at nih register: nct00303082.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention of the enteric colonization by candida in preterm newborns: incidence of late-onset sepsis and neurological outcome.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of gastrointestinal colonization by candida species, of late-onset sepsis and neurological outcome in preterm newborns. study design: a prospective study was conducted in 249 preterms who were subdivided into three groups: one group (n=83) was supplemented with lactobacillus (l.) reuteri, one group with l. rhamnosus (n=83) and the other with no supplementation (n=83). the fungal colonization in the gastrointestinal tract, the late onset of sepsis and clinical parameters were recorded. a neurological structured assessment was further performed at 1 year of age. result: candida stool colonization was significantly higher (p<0.01) in the  control group than in the groups treated with probiotics. the l. reuteri group presented a significantly higher reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms than did  the l. rhamnosus and control groups. infants treated with probiotics showed a statistically significant lower incidence of abnormal neurological outcome than did the control group. conclusion: the use of both probiotics seems to be effective in the prevention of gastrointestinal colonization by candida, in the protection from late-onset sepis and in reducing abnormal neurological outcomes in preterms.

TI  == lactobacillus by-products inhibit the growth and virulence of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == uropathogenic strains of escherichia coli (upec) can colonize the vagina and cause infections within the entire urogenital tract, including those associated with urinary tract devices. lactobacilli typically dominate the vaginal microbiota in healthy women, and studies have shown that they can inhibit upec growth and vaginal colonization. however, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind these effects. using a luciferase-based reporter construct, gradients of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and spent culture supernatants (scs)  from urogenital probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 were examined for their effects on growth and virulence factor expression in upec isolate c1212. in a dose- and ph- dependent manner, lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and lactobacillus scs all strongly inhibited upec c1212 growth and increased the promoter activity of outer membrane proteins (omps) a and x, two porins normally upregulated in response to upec membrane stress. lactic acid and  the culture supernatants also downregulated the promoter activity of the major subunits of type 1 and p fimbriae, critical adherence factors within the urogenital tract. our findings indicate that compounds secreted by lactobacilli likely protect the urogenital tract from upec colonization and infection by inhibiting growth, inducing stress and downregulating proteins critical for host  attachment.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

TI  == in vitro effects of food extracts on selected probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a panel of 148 extracts from 37 food products was prepared using organic and aqueous solvents and both neutral and acidic conditions. the panel of food products tested included fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs and spices, most of which are common in a normal european-style diet. the impact of these extracts on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacteria lactis) and pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli 0157:h7 and escherichia coli lf82) was assessed using a standard minimum inhibitory concentration method. the results showed that aqueous extractions of garlic and black peppercorns significantly enhanced the growth of one strain of probiotic bacteria (l. reuteri) whilst inhibiting both pathogenic strains of e. coli at a 1:50 dilution. aqueous extracts of banana, apple and orange all enhanced the growth of the three probiotic strains significantly, and inhibited the pathogens to approximately 80% of the controls (not significant). both aqueous and organic extractions of ginger significantly inhibited the growth of one or both e. coli strains, respectively (also at the 1:50 dilution).

AB  == the management of urinary tract infection (uti) in individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) continues to be of concern, due to complications that can occur. an  emerging concept that is a common underlying pathophysiological process is involved, wherein pathogens causing uti have a role in inflammatory progression.  we hypothesized that members of the commensal flora, such as lactobacilli, may counter this reaction through anti-inflammatory mediation. this was assessed in a pilot two-patient study in which probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri were administered to one patient and placebo to another, both along with antibiotics to treat acute uti. urinary tnf-alpha was significantly downregulated (p = .015) in the patient who received the probiotic  and who used intermittent catheterization compared with patient on placebo and using an indwelling catheter. the extent to which this alteration resulted in improved well-being in spinal cord injured patients remains to be determined in a larger study.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 on the ability of candida albicans to infect cells and induce inflammation.
AB  == vulvovaginal candidiasis, a high prevailing infection worldwide, is mainly caused by candida albicans. probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 have been previously shown to be useful as adjuvants in the treatment of women with vvc. in order to demonstrate and better understand the anti-candida activity of the probiotic microorganisms in an in vitro model simulating vaginal candidiasis, a human vaginal epithelial cell line (vk2/e6e7) was infected with c.albicans 3153a and then challenged with probiotic l. rhamnosus gr-1 and/or l. reuteri rc-14 or their respective cfs (alone or in combination). at each time point (0, 6, 12 and 24 hr), numbers of yeast, lactobacilli and viable vk2/e6e7 cells were determined and, at 0, 6 and 12 hr, the supernatants were measured for cytokine levels. we found that c. albicans induced a significant increase in il-1alpha and il-8 production by vk2/e6e7 cells. after lactobacilli challenge, epithelial cells did not alter il-6, il-1alpha, rantes and vegf levels. however, cfs from the probiotic microorganisms up-regulated il-8 and ip-10 levels secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells infected with c. albicans. at 24 hr of co-incubation, l. reuteri rc-14 alone and in combination with l. rhamnosus gr-1 decreased the yeast population recoverable from the cells. in conclusion, l. reuteri rc-14 alone and together with l. rhamnosus gr-1 have the potential to inhibit the yeast growth and their cfs may up-regulate il-8 and  ip-10 secretion by vk2/e6e7 cells, which could possibly have played an important  role in helping to clear vvc in vivo.

TI  == survival of lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg in the human gastrointestinal tract with daily consumption of a low-fat probiotic spread.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts,  confer a health benefit on the host. therefore, probiotic strains should be able  to survive passage through the human gastrointestinal tract. human gastrointestinal tract survival of probiotics in a low-fat spread matrix has, however, never been tested. the objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human intervention study was to test the human gastrointestinal tract survival of lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg after daily consumption of a low-fat probiotic spread  by using traditional culturing, as well as molecular methods. forty-two healthy human volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups provided with 20 g of placebo spread (n = 13), 20 g of spread with a target dose of 1 x 10(9) cfu of l. reuteri dsm 17938 (n = 13), or 20 g of spread with a target dose  of 5 x 10(9) cfu of l. rhamnosus gg (n = 16) daily for 3 weeks. fecal samples were obtained before and after the intervention period. a significant increase, compared to the baseline, in the recovery of viable probiotic lactobacilli in fecal samples was demonstrated after 3 weeks of daily consumption of the spread containing either l. reuteri dsm 17938 or l. rhamnosus gg by selective enumeration. in the placebo group, no increase was detected. the results of selective enumeration were supported by quantitative pcr, detecting a significant increase in dna resulting from the probiotics after intervention. overall, our results indicate for the first time that low-fat spread is a suitable carrier for these probiotic strains.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == the role of lactobacillus probiotics in the treatment or prevention of urogenital infections--a systematic review.
AB  == probiotics are increasingly being used to treat and prevent urogenital infections. however, a critical assessment of their efficacy in major urogenital  infections is lacking. we report the results of a systematic review to determine  the efficacy of probiotics for prevention or treatment of three major urogenital  infections: bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infection. using multiple computerized databases, we extracted data from clinical trials using a lactobacillus-containing preparation to either prevent or treat a  urogenital infection. of 25 included studies, 18 studies used lactobacillus preparations for treatment or prevention of urogenital infections and seven studies focused solely on vaginal colonization. four studies included patients with vaginal candidiasis, five included patients with urinary tract infections, and eight included patients with bacterial vaginosis. one included several types  of genitourinary infections. overall, lactobacilli were beneficial for the treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis. no clear benefit was seen for candidiasis or urinary tract infection. studies were heterogeneous, with some limited by a small population size. in conclusion, the use of certain lactobacillus strains such as l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri for prevention and treatment of recurrent urogenital infection is promising, especially for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. scant data on the use of probiotics for urinary tract infection and vulvovaginal candidiasis precludes definitive recommendations. further research and larger studies on types of lactobacilli strains, dosage of lactobacilli, optimal route and vehicle of administration are  needed.

TI  == adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. in this study we  analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. we show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between lactobacillus species. lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached  to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli  and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting  in reduced bacterial colonisation. also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of  removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

TI  == randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral lactobacilli to improve the vaginal flora of postmenopausal women.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the influence of the orally administered probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 on the quality of the vaginal flora in postmenopausal women. study design: postmenopausal women with nugent scores between 4 and 6 in initial vaginal swab, were randomized into  two groups. women in the intervention group received probiotic capsules containing 2.5x10(9)cfu (colony forming units) each of lyophilized l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 and women in the control group received an oral placebo once daily, in both groups for 14 days. final vaginal swabs were taken 1 day after the last administration of the medication. the primary efficacy variable was a change in the nugent score between baseline and the end of the study of at  least two grades in each individual patient. results: seventy two women were recruited in the study, 35 assigned to the intervention group and 37 to the control group. twenty-one of the 35 subjects (60%) in the intervention group and  6 of the 37 subjects (16%) in the control group showed a reduction in the nugent  score by at least two grades. the difference in the number of patients with improvement was highly significant (p=0.0001). the median difference in nugent scores between baseline and the end of the study was 3 in the intervention group  and 0 in the control group (p=0.0001). conclusion: our results provide evidence for an alternative modality to restore the normal vaginal flora using specific probiotic strains administered orally.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli for urogenital health in women.
AB  == the microbiota of the vagina form mostly from ascension of microbes from the rectal area. the numbers and types of microbes fluctuates with hormone levels, sexual contact, douching, and diet, yet the basic composition is relatively simple, with lactobacilli dominant in healthy females. the depletion of these organisms in women susceptible to urinary and vaginal infections, raised the question of whether artificial supplementation of lactobacilli could lower infection rates. to date, a 2 strain combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1  and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 have proved to be the most effective at restoring and maintaining a normal vaginal microbiota. other organisms show promise in resolving diseases that afflict over 1 billion women worldwide each year. the mechanisms involved have not been completely resolved, but seem to include modulation of host immunity, reduction in pathogen ascension from the rectum, and interference with colonization and survival of pathogens.

TI  == protective effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] and bifidobacterium infantis in murine models for colitis do not involve the vagus nerve.
AB  == the vagus nerve is an important pathway signaling immune activation of the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. probiotics are live organisms that may engage signaling pathways of the brain-gut axis to modulate inflammation. the protective effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] (lr) and bifidobacterium infantis (bi) during intestinal inflammation were studied after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in acute dextran sulfate sodium (dss) colitis in balb/c mice and chronic colitis induced by transfer of cd4(+) cd62l(+) t lymphocytes from balb/c into scid mice. lr and bi (1 x 10(9)) were given daily. clinical score, myeloperoxidase (mpo) levels, and in vivo and in vitro secreted inflammatory cytokine levels were found to be more severe in mice that were vagotomized compared with sham-operated animals. lr in the acute dss model was effective in decreasing the mpo and cytokine levels in the tissue in sham and vagotomized mice. bi had a strong downregulatory effect on secreted in vitro cytokine levels and had a greater anti-inflammatory effect in vagotomized- compared with sham-operated mice. both lr and bi retained anti-inflammatory effects in vagotomized mice. in scid mice, vagotomy did not enhance inflammation, but bi was more effective in vagotomized mice than shams. taken together, the intact vagus has a protective role in acute dss-induced colitis in mice but not in the chronic t cell transfer model of colitis. furthermore, lr and bi do not seem to engage their protective effects via this cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, but the results interestingly show that, in the t cell, transfer model vagotomy had a biological effect, since it increased the effectiveness of the bi  in downregulation of colonic inflammation.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of probiotic yogurt in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
AB  == our aim was to assess anti-inflammatory effects on the peripheral blood of subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) who consumed probiotic yogurt for  1 month. we studied 20 healthy controls and 20 subjects with ibd, 15 of whom had  crohn's disease and five with ulcerative colitis. all the subjects consumed lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 supplemented yogurt for 30 days. the presence of putative regulatory t (t(reg)) cells (cd4(+) cd25(high)) and cytokines in t cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (dc) was determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood before and after treatment, with or without  ex vivo stimulation. serum and faecal cytokine concentrations were determined by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the proportion of cd4(+) cd25(high) t cells increased significantly (p = 0.007) in ibd patients, mean (95% confidence interval: ci) 0.84% (95% ci 0.55-1.12) before and 1.25% (95% ci 0.97-1.54) after  treatment, but non-significantly in controls. the basal proportion of tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha(+)/interleukin (il)-12(+) monocytes and myeloid dc decreased in both subject groups, but of stimulated cells only in ibd patients. also serum il-12 concentrations and proportions of il-2(+) and cd69(+) t cells from stimulated cells decreased in ibd patients. the increase in cd4(+) cd25(high) t cells correlated with the decrease in the percentage of tnf-alpha- or il-12-producing monocytes and dc. the effect of the probiotic yogurt was confirmed by a follow-up study in which subjects consumed the yogurt without the  probiotic organisms. probiotic yogurt intake was associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects that paralleled the expansion of peripheral pool of putative t(reg) cells in ibd patients and with few effects in controls.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is particularly common in black women, and in nigeria it is often caused by mycoplasma, as well as atopobium, prevotella and gardnerella sp. antimicrobial metronidazole oral therapy is poorly effective in eradicating the condition and restoring the lactobacillus microbiota in the vagina. in this study, 40 women diagnosed with bv by discharge, fishy odor, sialidase positive test and nugent gram stain scoring, were randomized to receive either two dried capsules containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14  each night for 5 days, or 0.75% metronidazole gel, applied vaginally twice a day  (in the morning and evening). follow-up at day 6, 15 and 30 showed cure of bv in  significantly more probiotic treated subjects (16, 17 and 18/20, respectively) compared to metronidazole treatment (9, 9 and 11/20: p=0.016 at day 6, p=0.002 at day 15 and p=0.056 at day 30). this is the first report of an effective (90%) cure of bv using probiotic lactobacilli. given the correlation between bv and hiv, and the high risk of the latter in nigeria, intravaginal use of lactobacilli could provide women with a self-use therapy, similar to over-the-counter anti-yeast medication, for treatment of urogenital infections.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == there is increasing evidence that staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. as staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent staph. aureus. in displacement assays the amount of adherent staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. moreover, adherent lactobacillus reuteri, lc. lactis and p. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. this was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of l. reuteri to the production of reuterin. this study shows for the first time that staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain lab strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.

(>10(5) cfu/ml) were recovered from the vagina of 96% probiotic-treated subjects compared to 53% controls at day 30. in summary, this study showed efficacious use of lactobacilli and antibiotic in the eradication of bv in black african women.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

AB  == patient enrolment in the 'non-antibiotic versus antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary-tract infections' (napruti) study was started in september 2005. in this study of women with recurrent urinary-tract infections we aim to investigate the effect of 12 months of non-antibiotic prophylaxis in comparison with antibiotic prophylaxis on the rate of recurrence of urinary-tract infections and the development of antibiotic resistance. the study consists of two interlinked, randomised, clinical non-inferiority trials. in one trial, 280 premenopausal women will receive either cranberry capsules (twice daily 500 mg) or standardised antibiotic therapy (once daily 480 mg trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). in the other trial, 280 postmenopausal women will receive either oral lactobacilli (twice daily a capsule with > 10(9) colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14) or standardised antibiotic therapy. non-inferiority of non-antibiotic prophylaxis would be attractive given its potential to reduce the prevalence of microbial resistance to antibiotics significantly.

TI  == new convenient defined media for [(35)s]methionine labelling and proteomic analyses of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to develop experimental conditions for efficient protein radiolabelling and two-dimensional (2d) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for investigation of stress proteomes of probiotic lactobacillus spp. methods and results: three chemically defined media (cdm) optimized from a commercial medium supported rapid growth of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus e97800, lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 and lactobacillus reuteri e97849, and a broad range of other lactic acid bacteria. these cdm allowed efficient protein radiolabelling, requiring as little as 200 mul of logarithmic culture and pulse-chase labelling of 20 min to detect c. 300 distinct protein spots in a mini-scale 2d-gel. proteins including dnak, groel and clpatpases were identified from the 2d-gels by immunoblotting. conclusions: radiolabelling coupled with 2d gel electrophoresis provides a sensitive means to monitor changes in protein synthesis rates in probistic lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: efficient tools for proteomic analyses of probiotic lactobacillus were developed and applied for stress-response studies.

TI  == probiotics to prevent urinary tract infections: the rationale and evidence.
AB  == for over 30 years, urologists have recognized in females, that urinary pathogens  almost always infect the host through ascension from the rectum, vagina to the urethra and bladder. likewise, the lactobacillus organisms that predominate in the vagina of healthy women, spread from the rectum and perineum and form a barrier in the vagina to bladder entry by uropathogens. the concept of artificially boosting the lactobacilli numbers through probiotic instillation has long been conceived, but only in recent years shown to be possible. not all lactobacilli are effective, and to date clinical efficacy only exists for lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri b-54 and rc-14. these strains are only commercially available in austria, and therefore for most urologists, while some probiotic organisms may reduce the recurrences of bladder  cancer or oxaluria, no probiotics can be recommended widely to prevent uti at present.

TI  == probiotics. some evidence of their effectiveness.
AB  == objective: to define the term probiotics, to indicate how to identify products that have been proven beneficial, and to assess the quality of evidence regarding probiotics. quality of evidence: a few level i studies support the effectiveness  of specific probiotics for certain diagnoses. for most so-called probiotics, however, weak or no evidence supports their effectiveness. main message: probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. level i evidence supports use of vsl#3 for maintaining remission of inflammatory colitis. probiotics for treating vaginal infections, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus reuteri rc-14, have level i evidence of effectiveness, but are not available in canada. specific probiotics taken for certain indications improve health and have few side effects. conclusion: limited but good evidence supports the role of certain probiotics in medical practice. because consumer pressure will undoubtedly stimulate further interest in probiotics, family doctors need to be informed about them so they can advise their patients appropriately.

TI  == colitic scid mice fed lactobacillus spp. show an ameliorated gut histopathology and an altered cytokine profile by local t cells.
AB  == background: scid mice transplanted with cd4 t blast cells develop colitis. we investigated if the disease was influenced in colitic mice treated with antibiotic and fed lactobacillus spp. methods: colitic scid mice were treated for 1 week with antibiotics (vancomycin/meropenem) followed or not followed by a 3-week administration of lactobacillus reuteri dsm-12246 and lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2 at 2x10 live bacteria/mouse/24 hours. after 12 weeks, the rectums were removed for histology, and cd4 t cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) were polyclonally activated for cytokine measurements. results: irrespective of no treatment or treatments with antibiotics and probiotics, all mice transplanted with t cell blasts lost 10% of their body weight during the 12-week experimental period, whereas the nontransplanted mice had a 10% weight increase (p<0.001). all mice treated with antibiotics but not fed probiotics showed severe gut inflammation, whereas only 2 of the 7 mice fed probiotics showed signs of severe colitis (p<0.05). mln-derived cd4 t cells from this latter group of mice showed lower levels of interleukin-4 secretion (p<0.05) and a tendency to higher interferon-gamma production than mice not fed probiotics. conclusions: our data suggest that probiotics added to the drinking water may ameliorate local histopathological changes and influence local cytokine levels in colitic mice but not alter the colitis-associated weight loss.

TI  == effect of probiotics on gastrointestinal symptoms and small intestinal permeability in children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == objective: to determine whether probiotic lactobacilli may alleviate small intestinal inflammation and strengthen the intestinal barrier function in children with atopic dermatitis. study design: in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2 and l reuteri dsm 12246) were administered for 6 weeks to 41 children with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis. gastrointestinal symptoms were registered before and during treatment and small intestinal permeability was measured by the lactulose-mannitol test. results: during lactobacillus supplementation, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms (39% during the placebo period versus 10% during active treatment, p=.002). there was a positive association between the lactulose to mannitol ratio and the severity of the eczema (r=0.61, p=.02 after placebo and r=0.53, p=.05 after active treatment). after probiotic treatment, the lactulose to mannitol ratio was lower (0.073) than after placebo (0.110, p=.001). conclusions: impairment of the intestinal mucosal barrier appears to be involved  in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. the study suggests that probiotic supplementation may stabilize the intestinal barrier function and decrease gastrointestinal symptoms in children with atopic dermatitis.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == live lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] is essential for the inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced interleukin-8 expression.
AB  == the mechanism of the apparent anti-inflammatory action of probiotic organisms is  unclear. lactobacillus reuteri is effective in inhibiting colitis in interleukin-10 (il-10)-deficient mice. nerve growth factor (ngf), in addition to  its activity on neuronal cell growth, has significant anti-inflammatory effects in several experimental systems in vitro and in vivo, including a model of colitis. our experiments were designed to explore the mechanism of effect of l. reuteri in the human epithelial cell lines t84 and ht29 on cytokine and ngf synthesis and il-8 response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). epithelial cells were cultured for various times with live and killed l. reuteri  and examined by reverse transcription-pcr for ngf, il-10, and tnf-alpha-induced il-8 expression. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular il-8 and secreted product. western blotting and confocal microscopy were used to determine the effects on ikappab and nf-kappab, respectively. live but not heat-killed or gamma-irradiated l. reuteri upregulated ngf and dose dependently inhibited constitutive synthesis by t84 and ht29 cells of il-8 and that induced by tnf-alpha in terms of mrna and intracellular and secreted protein. similarly, l. reuteri inhibited il-8 synthesis induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. l. reuteri required preincubation and adherence for effect, inhibited translocation of nf-kappab to the nuclei of hela cells, and prevented degradation of ikappab. neither cellular lysates nor media supernatants had any effect on tnf-alpha-induced il-8. the conclusion is that l. reuteri has potent direct anti-inflammatory activity on human epithelial cells, which is likely to be related to the activity of ingested probiotics. l. reuteri also upregulates an unusual anti-inflammatory molecule, ngf, and inhibits nf-kappab translocation to the nucleus.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria, in maize porridge with added malted barley.
AB  == a fermented probiotic maize porridge with high energy density and low viscosity was prepared, using maize flour and barley malt. the porridge was fermented with  four probiotic strains (grown separately): lactobacillus reuteri, lb. acidophilus (la5 and 1748) and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains were inoculated at two levels; to obtain approx. 7 or 6 log cfu g(-1) in the porridge at 0 h. the porridge was fermented for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and analysed for viable cell count, ph, organic acids, volatile aromatic compounds and sugar content. the inoculated cell concentration was shown to be particularly important during the first hours of the fermentation period, showing a delayed production of most metabolites in porridge inoculated with approx. 6 log cfu g(-1). most strains reached maximum cell count after 12-h fermentation (7.2-8.2 log cfu g(-1)), with a ph below 4.0.  depending on the strain, lactic acid was produced in amounts ranging from 1360 to 4000 mg kg(-1). lb. reuteri metabolised succinate, while pyruvate and small amounts of diacetyl were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748. high amounts of diacetyl (6 mg kg(-1)) and acetoin (27  mg kg(-1)) were detected in porridge inoculated with lb. rhamnosus gg. porridge inoculated with lb. acidophilus la5 and lb. acidophilus 1748, contained acetaldehyde, while both lb. reuteri and lb. rhamnosus gg reduced the acetaldehyde to ethanol. lb. reuteri utilised both maltose and glucose as carbohydrate sources, while lb. acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748 and lb. rhamnosus gg utilised only glucose.

TI  == growth and metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria in milk.
AB  == growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (uht) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. the probiotic strains were lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg,  lactobacillus reuteri sd 2112 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12. fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees c and the samples were analysed for ph, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. the strains reduced ph from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. all strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. the  two lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h  of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. however, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. after 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. all five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. our findings show the importance of controlling the  fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.

TI  == disease-dependent adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to the human intestinal mucosa.
AB  == their adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is considered one of the main reasons for the beneficial health effects of specific lactic acid bacteria (lab). however, the influence of disease on the mucosal adhesion is largely unknown. adhesion of  selected lab to resected colonic tissue and mucus was determined in patients with three major intestinal diseases (i.e., diverticulitis, rectal carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease) and compared to healthy control tissue. all strains were observed to adhere better to immobilized mucus than to whole intestinal tissue. two strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and l. reuteri) were found to exhibit disease-specific adhesion to intestinal tissue. all tested strains, with the exception of l. rhamnosus strain gg, displayed disease-specific adhesion to intestinal mucus. these results suggest that strains with optimal binding characteristics for a particular intestinal disease can be selected.

TI  == effect of probiotic lactobacillus strains in children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that oral bacteriotherapy with probiotics might be useful in the management of atopic dermatitis (ad). objective: the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical and anti-inflammatory  effect of probiotic supplementation in children with ad. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 2 probiotic lactobacillus strains (lyophilized lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2 and lactobacillus reuteri dsm 122460) were given in combination for 6 weeks to 1- to 13-year-old children with ad. the patients' evaluations were registered after each intervention (ie, better, unchanged, or worse). the clinical severity of the eczema was evaluated by using the scoring atopic dermatitis (scorad) score. as inflammatory markers, eosinophil cationic protein in serum and cytokine production by pbmcs were measured. results: after active treatment, 56% of the patients experienced improvement of the eczema, whereas only 15% believed their symptoms had improved  after placebo (p =.001). the total scorad index, however, did not change significantly. the extent of the eczema decreased during active treatment from a  mean of 18.2% to 13.7% (p =.02). the treatment response was more pronounced in allergic patients (at least one positive skin prick test response and elevated ige levels), and in this group the scorad score decreased (p =.02 compared with nonallergic patients). during active treatment, serum eosinophil cationic protein levels decreased (p =.03). no significant changes in the production of the cytokines il-2, il-4, il-10, or ifn-gamma were found. conclusions: a combination  of l rhamnosus 19070-2 and l reuteri dsm 122460 was beneficial in the management  of ad. the effect was more pronounced in patients with a positive skin prick test response and increased ige levels.

TI  == reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. sulfide reduction by strain ke99 in mrs broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. ke99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm)  growth conditions at ph 6.0-8.0 range. maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by l. casei 393 at ph 7.0 (272 ppm); l. rhamnosus at ph 8.0 (277 ppm); and l. reuteri at ph 7.0 (244 ppm). ke99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001)  in mrs broth spiked with na2s (374 ppm) than (nh4)2s (340 ppm) salts. ammonia reduction by strain ke99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in mrs broth was low. ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. ke99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. ke99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to bio-coat (cn type-i, cn type-iv, laminin, fibronectin), matrigel, and caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. the number of lactobacilli binding to caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain ke99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell  (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with l. casei 393, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus, respectively. the interaction of ke99 to immobilized cn type-i was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. ke99 binding to cn type-i occurred at a wide ph range and was biphasic with maximum binding at ph 5.5 and 7.5. inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the ke99 binding to immobilized cn type-i may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. ke99 effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in the range of 55% (atcc43895) to 76% (atcc43894). the binding-displacement values for l. casei 393, l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus to detach cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 (atcc43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried ke99 preparation effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol ke99 concentration.

AB  == background: certain lactobacilli reduce the severity of experimental colitis. the aim of this study was to compare the effects of a human strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and a rat strain lactobacillus reuteri r2lc on acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. methods: lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri r2lc  or sulphasalazine were given orally to the rats. colitis was assessed 72 h after  induction with acetic acid. results: lactobacillus reuteri r2lc significantly antagonized body weight loss caused by inflammation compared with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and sulphasalazine, and oedema formation in the colon compared with  sulphasalazine. lactobacillus reuteri r2lc reduced the median value of macroscopic ulceration and the protein content of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 50% and the median of the protein content of inducible cyclooxygenase by 30% compared with that of the colitis control group, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg reduced the median of inducible nitric oxide protein content by 40% and increased the median of inducible cyclooxygenase protein content by 30% compared with the median value of the colitis control group, but these differences were not statistically significant. conclusions: the rat strain lactobacillus reuteri r2lc, but not the human strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, is of benefit in reducing the severity of acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. these results suggest that it is not the total amount of lactobacillus but the particular species or strain of lactobacillus that is important in attenuating experimental  colitis.

TI  == exclusion of vana, vanb and vanc type glycopeptide resistance in strains of lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus used as probiotics by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization methods.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus reuteri and lact. rhamnosus are used as probiotics in man and animal. the aim of this study was to determine whether the glycopeptide resistance in these lactobacilli has a similar genetic basis as in enterococci. five lact. reuteri strains and one lact. rhamnosus, as well as four enterococcus  control strains, were probed for the vana gene cluster, the vanb gene and the vanc gene by pcr and southern hybridization, and dna/dna hybridization. their resistance and plasmid patterns were also investigated. all lactobacillus strains were resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to a broad range of antibiotics. four of the lactobacillus strains (including the lact. rhamnosus strain) did not  harbour any plasmid and two of them contained five and 6 plasmid bands respectively. none of the lactobacillus strains possessed the vana, vanb or vanc  gene. these findings indicate that the glycopeptide resistance of the lactobacillus strains analysed is different from the enterococcal type. the study provides reassurance on the safety of the lactobacillus strains used as probiotics with regard to their vancomycin resistance.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), lact. rhamnosus (six strains), lact. gasseri (three strains), lact. acidophilus (one strain) and lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to sds-page of whole cell proteins and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. results obtained by rrna probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to lact. reuteri. isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.

TI  == screening of probiotic activities of forty-seven strains of lactobacillus spp. by in vitro techniques and evaluation of the colonization ability of five selected strains in humans.
AB  == the probiotic potential of 47 selected strains of lactobacillus spp. was investigated. the strains were examined for resistance to ph 2.5 and 0.3% oxgall, adhesion to caco-2 cells, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria in model systems. from the results obtained in vitro, five strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, l. rhamnosus lgg, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis chcc 2329, and l. casei subsp. alactus chcc 3137, were  selected for in vivo studies. the daily consumption by 12 healthy volunteers of two doses of 10(10) freeze-dried bacteria of the selected strains for 18 days was followed by a washout period of 17 days. fecal samples were taken at days 0 and 18 and during the washout period at days 5 and 11. lactobacillus isolates were initially identified by api 50chl and internal transcribed spacer pcr, and their  identities were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. among the tested strains, l. rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, and l. rhamnosus lgg were identified most frequently in fecal samples; they were found in 10, 8, and 7 of the 12 samples tested during the intervention period, respectively, whereas reisolations were less frequent in the washout period. the bacteria were reisolated in concentrations from 10(5) to  10(8) cells/g of feces. survival and reisolation of the bacteria in vivo appeared to be linked to ph tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == in vitro studies of porcine lactobacilli for possible probiotic use.
AB  == fourteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from the gut of suckling pigs were identified and studied to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial feed additives, acid tolerance, adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine and antimicrobial activity. four strains were identified as lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, two strains as lactobacillus rhamnosus as well  as lactobacillus reuteri and three strains as lactobacillus salivarius. the remaining strains could not be identified. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed susceptibility of the lactobacilli to many of the antimicrobial feed additives commonly used in pigs. strains resistant to cyadox and nourseothricin occurred in high numbers. the tested lactobacilli were acid-resistant at ph 3. thirteen strains of lactobacilli exhibited strong adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine while one strain was classed as weakly-adherent. all lactobacilli showed inhibitory activity against indicator bacteria in the presence of glucose. lactate and acetate were the principal final products of glucose fermentation in all strains. only three strains produced h2o2 in detectable amounts.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
