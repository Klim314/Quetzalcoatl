AB  - We announce the draft genome sequence of Clostridium sp. JC272, isolated from a sediment sample collected from marine habitats of Gujarat, India. Clostridium sp. JC272 is an obligate anaerobe and has the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds. The genome sequence indicates the strain's capability of producing small peptides (microcins), which are potential novel antibiotics.
TI  - Effect of the Organic Loading Rate Increase and the Presence of Zeolite on Microbial Community Composition and Process Stability During Anaerobic Digestion of Chicken Wastes.
AB  - This study investigates the effect of the organic loading rate (OLR) increase from 1.0 to 3.5 g VS L-1 day-1 at constant hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 35 days on anaerobic reactors' performance and microbial diversity during mesophilic anaerobic digestion of ammonium-rich chicken wastes in the absence/presence of zeolite. The effects of anaerobic process parameters on microbial community structure and dynamics were evaluated using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based pyrosequencing approach. Maximum 12 % of the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) was efficiently removed by zeolite in the fixed zeolite reactor (day 87). In addition, volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the fixed zeolite reactor accumulated in lower concentrations at high OLR of 3.2-3.5 g VS L-1 day-1. Microbial communities in the fixed zeolite reactor and reactor without zeolite were dominated by various members of Bacteroidales and Methanobacterium sp. at moderate TAN and VFA levels. The increase of the OLR accompanied by TAN and VFA accumulation and increase in pH led to the predominance of representatives of the family Erysipelotrichaceae and genera Clostridium and Methanosarcina. Methanosarcina sp. reached relative abundances of 94 and 57 % in the fixed zeolite reactor and reactor without zeolite at the end of the experimental period, respectively. In addition, the diminution of Synergistaceae and Crenarchaeota and increase in the abundance of Acholeplasmataceae in parallel with the increase of TAN, VFA, and pH values were observed.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria involved in the degradation of aromatic sulfonates to methane].
AB  - An anaerobic microbial consortium that degrades benzene- and p-toluenesulfonate to form methane and fatty acids has been produced. Pure cultures of three strains of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria Clostridium spp., as well as the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio sp., were isolated and characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains showed that pure cultures of clostridia strains 14, 24, and 21 are close to Clostridium lituseburense DSM 797T, C. sartagoforme DSM 1292T, and C. pascui DSM 10365T, and the sulfate-reducing strain SR1 is genotypically closer to Desulfovibrio aminophilus ALA-3T. Preliminary characterization of isolated bacteria makes it possible to assume that these are new species of the genera Clostridium and Desulfovibrio, the distinctive feature of which is the ability to incorporate aromatic sulfonates in their metabolisms.
TI  - Butyric acid production from red algae by a newly isolated Clostridium sp. S1.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To produce butyric acid from red algae such as Gelidium amansii in which galactose is a main carbohydrate, microorganisms utilizing galactose and tolerating inhibitors in hydrolysis including levulinic acid and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are required. RESULTS: A newly isolated bacterium, Clostridium sp. S1 produced butyric acid not only from galactose as the sole carbon source but also from a mixture of galactose and glucose through simultaneous utilization. Notably, Clostridium sp. S1 produced butyric acid and a small amount of acetic acid with the butyrate:acetate ratio of 45.4:1 and it even converted acetate to butyric acid. Clostridium sp. S1 tolerated 0.5-2 g levulinic acid/l and recovered from HMF inhibition at 0.6-2.5 g/l, resulting in 85-92 % butyric acid concentration of the control culture. When acid-pretreated G. amansii hydrolysate was used, Clostridium sp. S1 produced 4.83 g butyric acid/l from 10 g galactose/l and 1 g glucose/l. CONCLUSION: Clostridium sp. S1 produces butyric acid from red algae due to its characteristics in sugar utilization and tolerance to inhibitors, demonstrating its advantage as a red algae-utilizing microorganism.
TI  - Draft genome sequences of clostridium strains native to Colombia with the potential to produce solvents.
AB  - Genomes from four Clostridium sp. strains considered to be mesophilic anaerobic bacteria, isolated from crop soil in Colombia, with a strong potential to produce alcohols like 1,3-propanediol, were analyzed. We present the draft genome of these strains, which will be useful for developing genetic engineering strategies.
TI  - Population Changes in a Community of Alkaliphilic Iron-Reducing Bacteria Due to Changes in the Electron Acceptor: Implications for Bioremediation at Alkaline Cr(VI)-Contaminated Sites.
AB  - A serial enrichment culture has been grown in an alkaline Fe(III)-citrate-containing medium from an initial inoculum from a soil layer beneath a chromium ore processing residue (COPR) disposal site where Cr(III) is accumulating from Cr(VI) containing leachate. This culture is dominated by two bacterial genera in the order Clostridiales, Tissierella, and an unnamed Clostridium XI subgroup. This paper investigates the growth characteristics of the culture when Cr(VI) is added to the growth medium and when aquifer sand is substituted for Fe(III)-citrate. The aim is to determine how the availability and chemical form of Fe(III) affects the growth of the bacterial consortium, to determine the impact of Cr(VI) on growth, and thus attempt to understand the factors that are controlling Cr(III) accumulation beneath the COPR site. The culture can grow fermentatively at pH 9.2, but growth is stronger when it is associated with Fe(III) reduction. It can withstand Cr(VI) in the medium, but growth only occurs once Cr(VI) is removed from solution. Cr(VI) reduced the abundance of Tissierella sp. in the culture, whereas the Clostridium XI sp. was Cr(VI) tolerant. In contrast, growth with solid phase Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides (present as coatings on aquifer sand) favoured the Tissierella C sp., possibly because it produces riboflavin as an extracellular electron shuttling compound allowing more efficient electron transfer to solid Fe(III) phases. Thus, it is suggested that bacterially mediated Cr(III) reduction in the soil beneath the COPR site is dependent on Fe(III) reduction to sustain the bacterial community.
TI  - Structural Modelling, Substrate Binding and Stability Studies of Endopectate Lyase (PL1B) of Family 1 Polysaccharide Lyase from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - An endo-pectate lyase (PL1B) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from Clostridium thermocellum was structurally characterized and its stability under chaotropic agent was determined. The putative domain PL1B was identified from the protein sequence ABN53381.1 belonging to superfamily 3 of pectate lyase. Multiple sequence alignment of PL1B with other known pectate lyases revealed the conserved and semi-conserved residues. The secondary structure of PL1B predicted by PsiPred and confirmed by Circular Dichroism showed the presence of 2 alpha-helices (2.06%), 26 beta-strands (40.54%) and 29 random coils (57.4%). The modelled protein represented right handed parallel beta-helix structure, where three parallel beta-sheets linked by loops coils around to form the beta-helix core. Quality assessment of energy minimized structure by Ramachandran plot displayed 82.8% residues in favoured region. Superposition of PL1B structure with Bsp165-PelA from Bacillus sp. revealed the substrate binding cleft formed by the amino acid residues from the loops and beta-sheet. Molecular dynamic simulation of modelled PL1B structure inferred that it is quite stable and compact. Docking studies identified Asp151, Arg209, Asn234, Arg236, Tyr271 and Ser272 as the key residues of PL1B involved during catalysis. Among them Arg209 is responsible for proton abstraction during beta-elimination. Protein melting studies on PL1B showed that there was 12 degrees C shift of peak from 74 to 86 degrees C in presence of 0.6 mM Ca(2+) ions, showing that they provide stability to the structure. The unfolding of PL1B by GuHCl or Urea by fluorescence study showed that the protein structure is stable and disintegrates at their higher concentrations.
TI  - Acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov., an anaerobic alkaliphilic bacterium isolated  from the Prony alkaline Hydrothermal Field in New Caledonia.
AB  - A novel anaerobic bacterium, strain ST07-YET, was isolated from a carbonate chimney of the Prony Hydrothermal Field (PHF) in New Caledonia. Cells were Gram-positive-staining, straight rods (0.7-0.8 x 3.0-5.0 microm). They were motile by the means of lateral flagella. Strain ST07-YET was mesophilic (optimum 35 degrees C), moderately alkaliphilic and halotolerant (optimum pH 8.7 and 5 g l-1 NaCl). Elemental sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, nitrate and nitrite were not used as terminal electron acceptors. Yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, casamino-acids, crotonate, pyruvate, galactose, maltose, sucrose, ribose, trehalose and glucose were used as carbon sources. Glucose fermentation led to acetate, H2 and CO2 formation. Arginine, serine, histidine, lysine, methionine and cysteine improved growth, but the Stickland reaction was negative for the combinations of amino acids tested. The major metabolic products from yeast extract fermentation were H2, acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate and propionate. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C16:0, C16:1 cis9, C14:0 and C16:1 cis7 (>5% of total fatty acids). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 32.9 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain ST07-YET was most closely related to Clostridium sticklandii DSM 159T and Acetoanaerobium noterae NOT-3T (96.7% and 96.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity). On the basis of phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological properties, strain ST07-YET (= DSM 27512 = JCM 19400) is proposed as a novel species of the genus Acetoanaerobium, order Clostridiales, phylum Firmicutes, as Acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov..
TI  - First Insights into the Genome of the N-Methylhydantoin-Degrading Clostridium sp. Strain FS41 (DSM 6877).
AB  - Clostridium sp. strain FS41 (DSM 6877) is a strictly anaerobic and Gram-positive  spindle-shaped rod. This spore-forming bacterium is able to degrade N-methylhydantoin, with N-carbamoylsarcosine and sarcosine as intermediates. The genome consists of one replicon (6.28 Mb) and harbors 5,735 predicted protein-coding genes.
TI  - Molecular Phylogenetic Diversity and Spatial Distribution of Bacterial Communities in Cooling Stage during Swine Manure Composting.
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and subsequent sub-cloning and sequencing were used in this study to analyze the molecular phylogenetic diversity and spatial distribution of bacterial communities in different spatial locations during the cooling stage of composted swine manure. Total microbial DNA was extracted, and bacterial near full-length 16S rRNA genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, RFLP-screened, and sequenced. A total of 420 positive clones were classified by RFLP and near-full-length 16S rDNA sequences. Approximately 48 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found among 139 positive clones from the superstratum sample; 26 among 149 were from the middle-level sample and 35 among 132 were from the substrate sample. Thermobifida fusca was common in the superstratum layer of the pile. Some Bacillus spp. were remarkable in the middle-level layer, and Clostridium sp. was dominant in the substrate layer. Among 109 OTUs, 99 displayed homology with those in the GenBank database. Ten OTUs were not closely related to any known species. The superstratum sample had the highest microbial diversity, and different and distinct bacterial communities were detected in the three different layers. This study demonstrated the spatial characteristics of the microbial community distribution in the cooling stage of swine manure compost.
TI  - Nitrogenase diversity and activity in the gastrointestinal tract of the wood-eating catfish Panaque nigrolineatus.
AB  - The Amazonian catfish, Panaque nigrolineatus, consume large amounts of wood in their diets. The nitrogen-fixing community within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of these catfish was found to include nifH phylotypes that are closely related to Clostridium sp., Alpha and Gammaproteobacteria, and sequences associated with GI tracts of lower termites. Fish fed a diet of sterilized palm wood were found to contain nifH messenger RNA within their GI tracts, displaying high sequence similarity to the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium group. Nitrogenase activity, measured by acetylene reduction assays, could be detected in freshly dissected GI tract material and also from anaerobic enrichment cultures propagated in nitrogen-free enrichment media; nifH sequences retrieved from these cultures were dominated by Klebsiella- and Clostridium-like sequences. Microscopic examination using catalyzed reporter deposition-enhanced immunofluorescence revealed high densities of nitrogenase-containing cells colonizing the woody digesta within the GI tract, as well as cells residing within the intestinal mucous layer. Our findings suggest that the P. nigrolineatus GI tract provides a suitable environment for nitrogen fixation that may facilitate production of reduced nitrogen by the resident microbial population under nitrogen limiting conditions. Whether this community is providing reduced nitrogen to the host in an active or passive manner and whether it is present in a permanent or transient relationship remains to be determined. The intake of a cellulose rich diet and the presence of a suitable environment for nitrogen fixation suggest that the GI tract microbial community may allow a unique trophic niche for P. nigrolineatus among fish.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Clostridium sp. Ne2, Clostridia from an Enrichment Culture Obtained from Australian Subterranean Termite, Nasutitermes exitiosus.
AB  - The draft genome sequence of Clostridium sp. Ne2 was reconstructed from a metagenome of a hydrogenogenic microbial consortium. The organism is most closely related to Clostridium magnum and is a strict anaerobe that is predicted to ferment a range of simple sugars.
TI  - Mesophilic hydrogen production in acidogenic packed-bed reactors (APBR) using raw sugarcane vinasse as substrate: Influence of support materials.
AB  - Bio-hydrogen production from sugarcane vinasse in anaerobic up-flow packed-bed reactors (APBR) was evaluated. Four types of support materials, expanded clay (EC), charcoal (Ch), porous ceramic (PC), and low-density polyethylene (LDP) were tested as support for biomass attachment. APBR (working volume - 2.3 L) were operated in parallel at a hydraulic retention time of 24 h, an organic loading rate of 36.2 kg-COD m-3 d-1, at 25 degrees C. Maximum volumetric hydrogen production values of 509.5, 404, 81.4 and 10.3 mL-H2 d-1 L-1reactor and maximum yields of 3.2, 2.6, 0.4 and 0.05 mol-H2 mol-1 carbohydrates total, were observed during the monitoring of the reactors filled with LDP, EC, Ch and PC, respectively. Thus, indicating the strong influence of the support material on H2 production. LDP was the most appropriate material for hydrogen production among the materials evaluated. 16S rRNA gene by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the selection of different microbial populations. 454-pyrosequencing performed on samples from APBR filled with LDP revealed the presence of hydrogen-producing organisms (Clostridium and Pectinatus), lactic acid bacteria and non-fermentative organisms.
TI  - Phylogenetic and syntenic data support a single horizontal transference to a Trypanosoma ancestor of a prokaryotic proline racemase implicated in parasite evasion from host defences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proline racemase (PRAC) enzymes of Trypanosoma cruzi (TcPRAC), the agent of Chagas disease, and Trypanosoma vivax (TvPRAC), the agent of livestock trypanosomosis, have been implicated in the B-cells polyclonal activation contributing to immunosuppression and the evasion of host defences. The similarity to prokaryotic PRAC and the absence in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma congolense have raised many questions about the origin, evolution, and functions of trypanosome PRAC (TryPRAC) enzymes. FINDINGS: We identified TryPRAC homologs as single copy genes per haploid genome in 12 of 15 Trypanosoma species, including T. cruzi and T. cruzi marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. erneyi, T. rangeli, T. conorhini and T. lewisi, all parasites of mammals. Polymorphisms in TcPRAC genes matched T. cruzi genotypes: TcI-TcIV and Tcbat have unique genes, while the hybrids TcV and TcVI contain TcPRACA and TcPRACB from parental TcII and TcIII, respectively. PRAC homologs were identified in trypanosomes from anurans, snakes, crocodiles, lizards, and birds. Most trypanosomes have intact PRAC genes. T. rangeli possesses only pseudogenes, maybe in the process of being lost. T. brucei, T. congolense and their allied species, except the more distantly related T. vivax, have completely lost PRAC genes. CONCLUSIONS: The genealogy of TryPRAC homologs supports an evolutionary history congruent with the Trypanosoma phylogeny. This finding, together with the synteny of PRAC loci, the relationships with prokaryotic PRAC inferred by taxon-rich phylogenetic analysis, and the absence in trypanosomatids of any other genera or in bodonids or euglenids suggest that a common ancestor of Trypanosoma gained PRAC gene by a single and ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a Firmicutes bacterium more closely related to Gemella and other species of Bacilli than to Clostridium as previously suggested. Our broad phylogenetic study allowed investigation of TryPRAC evolution over long and short timescales. TryPRAC genes diverged to become species-specific and genotype-specific for T. cruzi and T. rangeli, with resulting genealogies congruent with those obtained using vertically inherited genes. The inventory of TryPRAC genes described here is the first step toward the understanding of the roles of PRAC enzymes in trypanosomes differing in life cycles, virulence, and infection and immune evasion strategies.
TI  - Engineered Biosynthesis of Enduracidin Lipoglycopeptide Antibiotics using the Ramoplanin Mannosyltransferase Ram29.
AB  - The lipopeptides ramoplanin from Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33076 and enduracidin produced by Streptomyces fungicidicus are effective antibiotics against a number of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. While these two antibiotics share a similar cyclic peptide structure, comprising 17 amino acids with an N-terminal fatty acid side chain, ramoplanin has a di-mannose moiety that enduracidin lacks. The mannosyl substituents of ramoplanin enhance aqueous solubility, which was important in the development of ramoplanin as a potential treatment for Clostridium difficile infections. In this study we have determined the function of the putative mannosyl transferase encoded by ram29 from the ramoplanin biosynthetic gene cluster. Bioinformatics revealed that Ram29 is an integral membrane protein with a putative DxD motif that is suggested to bind to, and activate, a polyprenyl phosphomannose donor and an extracytoplasmic C-terminal domain that is predicted to bind the ramoplanin aglycone acceptor. The ram29 gene was cloned into the tetracycline inducible plasmid pMS17 and integrated into the genome of the enduracidin producer S. fungicidicus. Induction of ram29 expression in S. fungicidicus resulted in the production of monomannosylated enduracidin derivatives, which are not present in the wild-type strain. Tandem MS analysis showed that mannosylation occurs on the Hpg11 residue of enduracidin. In addition to confirming the function of Ram29, these findings demonstrate how the less common, membrane associated, polyprenyl phosphosugar-dependent glycosyltransferases can be used in natural product glycodiversification. Such a strategy may be valuable in future biosynthetic engineering approaches aimed at improving the physicochemical and biological properties of bioactive secondary metabolites including antibiotics.
TI  - Application of a pathogen microarray for the analysis of viruses and bacteria in  clinical diagnostic samples from pigs.
AB  - Many of the disease syndromes challenging the commercial swine industry involve the analysis of complex problems caused by polymicrobial, emerging or reemerging, and transboundary pathogens. This study investigated the utility of the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California), designed to detect 8,101 species of microbes, in the evaluation of known and unknown microbes in serum, oral fluid, and tonsil from pigs experimentally coinfected with Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). The array easily identified PRRSV and PCV-2, but at decreased sensitivities compared to standard polymerase chain reaction detection methods. The oral fluid sample was the most informative, possessing additional signatures for several swine-associated bacteria, including Streptococcus sp., Clostridium sp., and Staphylococcus sp.
TI  - High organic loading rate on thermophilic hydrogen production and metagenomic study at an anaerobic packed-bed reactor treating a residual liquid stream of a Brazilian biorefinery.
AB  - This study evaluated the influence of a high organic loading rate (OLR) on thermophilic hydrogen production at an up-flow anaerobic packed-bed reactor (APBR) treating a residual liquid stream of a Brazilian biorefinery. The APBR, filled with low-density polyethylene, was operated at an OLR of 84.2kg-CODm(-3)d(-1). This value was determined in a previous study. The maximum values of hydrogen production and yield were 5,252.6mL-H2d(-1) and 3.7mol-H2mol(-1)total carbohydrates, respectively. However, whereas the OLR remained constant, the specific organic load rate (sOLR) decreased throughout operation from 1.38 to 0.72g-Total carbohydratesg-VS(-1)h(-1), this decrease negatively affected hydrogen production. A sOLR of 0.98g-Total carbohydratesg-VS(-1)h(-1) was optimal for hydrogen production. The microbial community was studied using 454-pyrosequencing analysis. Organisms belonging to the genera Caloramator, Clostridium, Megasphaera, Oxobacter, Thermoanaerobacterium, and Thermohydrogenium were detected in samples taken from the reactor at operation days 30 and 60, suggesting that these organisms contribute to hydrogen production.
TI  - [Efficacy of pectin in the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of pectin, a kind of soluble dietary fiber, in diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome(IBS-D). METHODS: A total of 87 patients with IBS-D were selected in the Jinling Hospital between July 2011 and December 2013. Using a randomized, controlled trial, the efficacy of pectin for IBS-D was prospectively evaluated. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 24 g pectin powder/d (n=46) or a placebo (n=41). Before and after 6 weeks of treatment, colonic microflora was examined by real-time PCR and compared between groups. Changes in stool frequency and form (Bristol stool scale), composite score of symptoms (Likert scale) and QOL scores (IBS-QOL questionnaire) were also monitored. Peripheral blood sample from patients with IBS-D was obtained to estimate the cytokines level, which was compared with that obtained from a group of age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (n=20). RESULTS: Those patients randomized to pectin experienced a greater reduction in composite symptom scores and Bristol stool scale scores, as well as significant improvement in QOL scores (P<0.05). The pectin acted as prebiotics and significantly enhanced faecal bifidobacteria and decreased total Clostridium sp (P<0.05). At baseline, patients with IBS-D demonstrated an abnormal IL-10/IL-12 ratio, which was normalized by pectin feeding alone (P<0.01). Placebo did not exert these effects on the aforementioned parameters after treatment. No significant adverse effects were reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Pectin acts as a prebiotic in specifically stimulating gut bifidobacteria in IBS-D patients and is effective in alleviating clinical symptoms, balancing colonic microflora and relieving systemic inflammation. In view of its ability to re-establish a healthy gut ecosystem, pectin has the potential of being a therapeutic agent in IBS-D.
TI  - Identification and catalytic residues of the arsenite methyltransferase from a sulfate-reducing bacterium, Clostridium sp. BXM.
AB  - Arsenic methylation is an important process frequently occurring in anaerobic environments. Anaerobic microorganisms have been implicated as the major contributors for As methylation. However, very little information is available regarding the enzymatic mechanism of As methylation by anaerobes. In this study, one novel sulfate-reducing bacterium isolate, Clostridium sp. BXM, which was isolated from a paddy soil in our laboratory, was demonstrated to have the ability of methylating As. One putative arsenite S-Adenosyl-Methionine methyltransferase (ArsM) gene, CsarsM was cloned from Clostridium sp. BXM. Heterologous expression of CsarsM conferred As resistance and the ability of methylating As to an As-sensitive strain of Escherichia coli. Purified methyltransferase CsArsM catalyzed the formation of methylated products from arsenite, further confirming its function of As methylation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that three conserved cysteine residues at positions 65, 153 and 203 in CsArsM are necessary for arsenite methylation, but only Cysteine 153 and Cysteine 203 are required for the methylation of monomethylarsenic to dimethylarsenic. These results provided the characterization of arsenic methyltransferase from anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium. Given that sulfate-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in various wetlands including paddy soils, enzymatic methylation mediated by these anaerobes is proposed to contribute to the arsenic biogeochemical cycling.
TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Microbiological contamination of dried and lyophilized garlic as a potential source of food spoilage.
AB  - Garlic is valued more for its flavoring and used in a wide variety of foods. In food technology, fresh garlic is not used, but instead its processed forms, most often dried and lyophilized, are utilized. The quality and safety of the final product largely depends on their microbiological quality. This research has provided information about effect of garlic fixation methods and provided information about effect of microbiological contamination of garlic used as a spice for quality of garlic mayonnaise sauce. The authors decided to undertake studies following a report from one of the manufacturers of garlic sauces on product defects which originated in dried garlic used in the production process. Samples of garlic (n = 26) were examinated using standard cultural methods (counts of fungi, lactic acid bacteria-LAB, spore-producing Bacillus sp. and the presence of anaerobic saccharolytic and proteolytic clostridia), automated system TEMPO (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae), immunoenzymatic method using VIDAS tests (occurrence of Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocytogenes). The number of total viable count was ranged from 3.51 to 6.85 log CFU/g. Enterobacteriaceae were detected only in one sample. Comparably low values were recorded for fungi (1.30 to 3.47 log CFU/g). The number of LAB was ranged from 2.34 to 5.49 log CFU/g. Clostridium sp. were detected in 22 samples. Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected. It was found that garlic, regardless of th preservation procedure, might be a source of contamination of garlic mayonnaise sauce especially with lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium sp. spores.
TI  - Microbiological evolution of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) in Canary Islands during ice storage.
AB  - This study analyses the microbiological changes with traditional methods for total mesophilic aerobic, psychrotrophic, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Shewanella putrefaciens, Enterobacteriaceae, sulfide-reducing Clostridium and Photobacterium phosphoreum in muscle, skin and gills of whole ungutted gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) stored in ice during 18 days. The muscle tissue showed the minor grade of contamination, followed by the skin and the gills, with statistic significance (p < 0.001). The most prominent microorganisms in the different tissues and at the end of the storage were Pseudomonas sp. (7.76, 10.11 and 10.40 log CFU/g), Aeromonas sp. (7.49, 8.24 and 9.02 log CFU/g) and S. putrefaciens (8.05, 7.49 and 8.05 log CFU/g) in sea bream harvested in the temperate water of the Canary Islands. The results obtained from this study can contribute to the improvement of microbiological knowledge of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) by determining the evolution of microorganisms responsible for spoilage and their counts in different tissues such as muscle, skin, and gills during iced storage.
TI  - Characteristics of Metroxylon sagu resistant starch type III as prebiotic substance.
AB  - Resistant starch type III (RS3 ) was produced from sago (Metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. Two RS3 samples designated sago RS and HCl-sago RS contained 35.71% and 68.30% RS, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. Both sago RS and HCl-sago RS were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at pH 1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. Both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of RS3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees C. Sago RS3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter coli, and Clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 CFU/mL. Hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago RS3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. The highest scores were obtained from Bifidobacterium sp. FTDC8943 grown on sago RS (+0.26) and HCl-sago RS (+0.24) followed by L. bulgaricus FTDC1511 grown on sago RS (+0.21). The findings had suggested that sago RS3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago RS3 as a prebiotic material.
TI  - Hormetic effect of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate on bacteria.
AB  - The biological effect of ionic liquids (ILs) is one of the highly debated topics  as they are being contemplated for various industrial applications. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) showed remarkable hormesis on anaerobic Clostridium sp. and aerobic Pseudomonas putida. Bacterial growth was stimulated at up to 2.5 g L(-1) and inhibited at >2.5 g L(-1) of [EMIM][Ac]. The growth of Clostridium sp. and P. putida were higher by 0.4 and 4-fold respectively, in the presence of 0.5 g L(-1) [EMIM][Ac]. Assessment of the effect of [EMIM][Ac] under different growth conditions showed that the hormesis of [EMIM][Ac] was mediated via regulation of medium pH. Hormetic effect of [EMIM][Ac] was evident only in medium with poor buffering capacity and in the presence of a fermentable substrate as the carbon source. The hormetic effect of [EMIM][Ac] on bacterial growth is most likely associated with the buffering capacity of acetate anion. These observations have implications in ILs toxicity studies and ecological risk assessment.
TI  - Development of rice bran treatment process and its use for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates from rice bran hydrolysate solution.
AB  - Rice bran treatment process for the production of 43.7 kg of hydrolysate solution containing 24.41 g/L of glucose and small amount of fructose from 5 kg of rice bran was developed and employed to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates in recombinant Escherichia coli and Ralstonia eutropha strains. Recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue expressing R. eutropha phaCAB genes and R. eutropha NCIMB11599 could produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) with the polymer contents of 90.1 wt% and 97.2 wt%, respectively, when they were cultured in chemically defined MR medium and chemically defined nitrogen free MR medium containing 10 mL/L of rice bran hydrolysate solution, respectively. Also, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue and recombinant R. eutropha 437-540, both of which express the Pseudomonas sp. phaC1437 gene and the Clostridium propionicum pct540 gene could produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) from rice bran hydrolysate solution. These results suggest that rice bran may be a good renewable resource for the production of biomass-based polymers by recombinant microorganisms.
TI  - [Analysis of microbial community variation in the domestication process of sludge in a sulfate-reducing reactor].
AB  - The variations of microbial community in the sludge of sulfate-reducing UASB during domestication period were analyzed by PCR-DGGE technique. The results showed that the diversity of microbial community was strongly related to the sulfate reduction and COD removal performance. The sulfate reduction rate of the reactor was about 95% when the Shannon index of microbial community was higher than 3.45. The preponderant bands in DGGE figure were excised and cloned, and the sequencing analysis indicated there were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus and Chloroflexi in the sludge, which accounted for 50.0%, 28.6% 14.3% and 7.1% of the total sequences of samples, respectively. The anaerobic fermentative bacteria of Clostridium sp. were predominant in the whole domestication period, but the predominant species was changing. Some anaerobic bacteria like Chloroflexi sp. and Geopsychrobacter sp. were detected to be dominant species, which then disappeared along with further domestication, but anaerobic bacteria Geobacter sp. became gradually predominant in the domestication process. Species of Desulfovibrio sp. were detected to be predominant only in the last two phases of domestication.
TI  - Bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in Chinese newborns.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. The present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (VD) or by cesarean section (CD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 VD infants and 16 CD infants. Profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. RESULTS: On days 2 and 4 of postnatal life, VD and CD infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. In VD infants, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides sp, and Bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. In CD infants, Staphylococcus sp, Clostridium sp, Enterobacter sp, and Streptococcus sp were more common. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in Chinese newborn infants. This is in accordance with data reported in other regions.
TI  - [Clinical benefits after soluble dietary fiber supplementation: a randomized clinical trial in adults with slow-transit constipation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of pectin, a kind of soluble dietary fiber, on colonic transit time (CTT), clinical symptoms and gut microbiota in adults with slow-transit constipation. METHODS: A total of 80 patients with slow-transit constipation were selected between June 2011 and December 2013. For this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of pectin on intestinal transit time and other indices of constipation in adults with slow-transit constipation. They were randomized to receive either pectin or placebo. Treatment consisted of 4-week supplementation with 24 g/d pectin (fiber group) or maltodextrin (placebo group). Before and after 4-week treatment, CTT, constipation symptoms and fecal bacterial population were compared between groups. RESULTS: CTT of the fiber group after treatment was lower than those of fiber group before treatment and those in the placebo group ((60.2 +/- 11.2) h vs (80.3 +/- 9.5), (79.4 +/- 11.7) h, P < 0.01). Constipation score of the fiber group after treatment also decreased than those of fiber group before treatment and those in the placebo group (both P < 0.05). Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. evidently increased (lg copies/g:8.26 +/- 0.83 vs 6.42 +/- 1.07 and 6.48 +/- 0.82, 6.83 +/- 0.77 vs 5.85 +/- 0.64 and 5.91 +/- 0.73; all P < 0.05) and total Clostridium sp. significantly decreased (9.07 +/- 0.63 vs 9.74 +/- 0.81 and 9.66 +/- 0.43, P < 0.05) in the fiber group after treatment versus the placebo group. No significant adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Four-week soluble dietary fiber use accelerates colon transit time and alleviates clinical symptoms in patients with slow-transit constipation. Additionally, supplementary fiber offers protective effects on gut microbiota by increasing the population of healthy microflora.
TI  - A sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium Bacillus sp. YAS 1 strain.
AB  - Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. The present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus sp. YAS 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. A sequential statistical approach (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (BAC YAS 1) production. Using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in BAC YAS 1 level (470 AU/mL arbitrary units against Erwinia amylovora). BAC YAS 1 showed activity over a wide range of pH (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees C). A wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of BAC YAS 1 against the human pathogens (Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp., and Salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (E. amylovora), and the food spoiler (Listeria innocua) was demonstrated. On top and above, BAC YAS 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. lactis, and L. reuteri). Promising characteristics of BAC YAS 1 prompt its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.
TI  - Genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a Dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
AB  - A Dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mM cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. To obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer SOLiD 3. Matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome sequences indicated that the Dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to Dehalococcoides mccartyi CBDB1 and BAV1. Sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of Sedimentibacter, Sulfurospirillum, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Proteocatella in addition to Dehalococcoides sp. After further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. Finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the Dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, D. mccartyi IBARAKI, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with the single-molecule DNA sequencer PacBio RS. The accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by SOLiD 3. The genome is 1,451,062 nt and the number of CDS is 1566, which includes 3 rRNA genes and 47 tRNA genes. There exist twenty-eight RDase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. The genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other Dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution RDase genes. The combination of a short-read next-generation DNA sequencer and a long-read single-molecule DNA sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.
TI  - Clostridium oryzae sp. nov., from soil of a Japanese rice field.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic bacterial strain designated KC3(T) was isolated from a rice straw-degrading culture, for which soil of a Japanese rice field was used as the inoculum. Cells of strain KC3(T) were determined to be non-cellulolytic, Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, ellipsoidal, spore-forming rods, 0.8-1x4-25 microm. Endospores were formed at a terminal position in elongated cells (12-25 microm, mean 15 microm). The temperature range for growth was 20-50 degrees C, with an optimum at 37 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 5.0-7.5, with an optimum at pH 6.0 (slightly acidophilic). Strain KC3(T) fermented cellobiose to lactate, butyrate, acetate, formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The major cellular fatty acids (>10 %) were C14 : 0, C16 : 0 and C19 : 0 cyclo 11,12 dimethylacetal. The DNA G+C content of strain KC3(T) was 37.5 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain KC3(T) shared low sequence similarity (<93 %) with type strains of the genus Clostridium sensu stricto (Clostridium rRNA cluster I). Analyses of the DNA gyrase A and ATP synthase beta subunit sequences supported the affiliation of strain KC3(T) to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto. The evidence presented here indicates that strain KC3(T) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Clostridium oryzae is KC3(T) ( = DSM 28571(T) = NBRC 110163(T)).
TI  - Detailed investigation of the microbial community in foaming activated sludge reveals novel foam formers.
AB  - Foaming of activated sludge (AS) causes adverse impacts on wastewater treatment operation and hygiene. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities of foam, foaming AS and non-foaming AS in a sewage treatment plant via deep-sequencing of the taxonomic marker genes 16S rRNA and mycobacterial rpoB and a metagenomic approach. In addition to Actinobacteria, many genera (e.g., Clostridium XI, Arcobacter, Flavobacterium) were more abundant in the foam than in the AS. On the other hand, deep-sequencing of rpoB did not detect any obligate pathogenic mycobacteria in the foam. We found that unknown factors other than the abundance of Gordonia sp. could determine the foaming process, because abundance of the same species was stable before and after a foaming event over six months. More interestingly, although the dominant Gordonia foam former was the closest with G. amarae, it was identified as an undescribed Gordonia species by referring to the 16S rRNA gene, gyrB and, most convincingly, the reconstructed draft genome from metagenomic reads. Our results, based on metagenomics and deep sequencing, reveal that foams are derived from diverse taxa, which expands previous understanding and provides new insight into the underlying complications of the foaming phenomenon in AS.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Enhanced biosynthesis of O-desmethylangolensin from daidzein by a novel oxygen-tolerant cock intestinal bacterium in the presence of atmospheric oxygen.
AB  - AIMS: To improve the oxygen-tolerant capability of a newly isolated anaerobic bacterium and to biosynthesize O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma) from daidzein aerobically. METHODS AND RESULTS: After a long-term domestication process, an oxygen-tolerant bacterium, which we named Aeroto-AUH-JLC108, was derived from the newly isolated obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium sp. AUH-JLC108. Strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 differed from the natively anaerobic wild-type strain AUH-JLC108 by various characteristics, including a change in bacterial shape, biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Both the growth speed and the maximal optical density (OD) value of strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 grown aerobically were significantly increased compared to that of the wild-type strain grown anaerobically. The maximal concentration of the substrate daidzein that the oxygen-tolerant strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 grown aerobically was able to convert efficiently was 2.0 mmol l(-1) and 0.6 mmol l(-1) for strain AUH-JLC108 that was grown anaerobically. CONCLUSIONS: Strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 is a conditional oxygen-tolerant bacterium. The growth speed, bacterial growth mass and bioconversion capability of strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 grown aerobically was significantly increased compared to that of the wild-type strain AUH-JLC108 grown anaerobically. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Strain Aeroto-AUH-JLC108 is the first reported pure culture responsible for the formation of O-Dma from daidzein in the presence of atmospheric oxygen.
TI  - Murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family Lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  - Three strains of an anaerobic, Gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. These strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family Lachnospiraceae (<94 %). The most closely related species with names that have standing in nomenclature were Robinsoniella peoriensis, Ruminococcus gnavus, Blautia producta and Clostridium xylanolyticum. Phylogenetic relationships based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60 genes. The use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for Ruminococcus gnavus and B. producta. All three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by C16 : 0 methyl ester. Differences in the proportions of C12 : 0 methyl ester, C14 : 0 methyl ester and C18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically neighbouring species. The major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain SRB-530-5-H(T) was acetic acid. This strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species Robinsoniella peoriensis. The isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. Based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species Murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains SRB-530-5-H(T) ( = DSM 26524(T) = CCUG 63391(T)) (the type strain of Murimonas intestini), SRB-509-4-S-H ( = DSM 27577 = CCUG 64595) and SRB-524-4-S-H ( = DSM 27578 = CCUG 64594).
TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in Olsztyn, Poland. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC22, HPC37), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. Their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6), 3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)CFU/g, respectively. It was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater than those obtained by the cultivation method. Among identified Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea spp. and Enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas Escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when E. coli were absent. Bacteria from Staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. Additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. Maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)CFU/g. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera were most numerous among molds, whereas Trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. Sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. Potentially pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when Toxocara and E. coli were absent. It seems that assessing the contamination of children's play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes and may not fully reflect their safety for children.
TI  - Mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov.: a novel bacterium isolated from the female genital tract.
AB  - Three isolates of a bacterium recovered from human endometrium using conventional culture methods were characterized biochemically and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Isolates were non-motile, obligately anaerobic, non-spore forming, asaccharolytic, non-cellulolytic, indole positive, Gram positive rods. Cell wall fatty acid profiling revealed C14:0, C16:0, C18:2 omega6, 9c, C18:1 omega9c and C18:0 to be the major fatty acid composition. The DNA mol % G+C was determined to be 44.2%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed only 91% sequence similarity with the closest cultivated bacterial isolate, Saccharofermentans acetigenes. Based on genotypic and phenotypic data, all three isolates are considered to be members of the same species and data suggest it represents a novel genus and species in the order Clostridiales with an association with Clostridium rRNA cluster III within the family Ruminococcaceae. We propose the name, Mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is BAA-2120(T) and CCUG 59143(T).
TI  - Simultaneous treatment of raw palm oil mill effluent and biodegradation of palm fiber in a high-rate CSTR.
AB  - A high-rate continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was used to produce biogas from raw palm oil mill effluent (POME) at 55 degrees C at a highest organic loading rate (OLR) of 19 g COD/ld. Physical and chemical pretreatments were not performed on the raw POME. In order to promote retention of suspended solids, the CSTR was installed with a deflector at its upper section. The average methane yield was 0.27 l/g COD, and the biogas production rate per reactor volume was 6.23 l/l d, and the tCOD removal efficiency was 82%. The hydrolysis rate of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin was 6.7, 3.0 and 1.9 g/d, respectively. The results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) suggested that the dominant hydrolytic bacteria responsible for the biodegradation of the palm fiber and residual oil were Clostridium sp., while the dominant methanogens were Methanothermobacter sp.
TI  - Anaerobic mineralization of 2,4,6-tribromophenol to CO2 by a synthetic microbial  community comprising Clostridium, Dehalobacter, and Desulfatiglans.
AB  - Anaerobic mineralization of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) was achieved by a synthetic anaerobe community comprising a highly enriched culture of Dehalobacter sp. phylotype FTH1 acting as a reductive debrominator; Clostridium sp. strain Ma13 acting as a hydrogen supplier via glucose fermentation; and a novel 4-chlorophenol-degrading anaerobe, Desulfatiglans parachlorophenolica strain DS. 2,4,6-TBP was debrominated to phenol by the combined action of Ma13 and FTH1, then mineralized into CO2 by sequential introduction of DS, confirmed using [ring-(14)C(U)] phenol. The optimum concentrations of glucose, SO4(2-), and inoculum densities were 0.5 or 2.5mM, 1.0 or 2.5mM, and the densities equivalent to 10(4)copiesmL(-1) of the 16S rRNA genes, respectively. This resulted in the complete mineralization of 23muM 2,4,6-TBP within 35days (0.58mumolL(-1)d(-1)). Thus, using a synthetic microbial community of isolates or highly enriched cultures would be an efficient, optimizable, low-cost strategy for anaerobic bioremediation of halogenated aromatics.
TI  - Freezing/thawing pretreatment coupled with biological process of thermophilic Geobacillus sp. G1: Acceleration on waste activated sludge hydrolysis and acidification.
AB  - A novel pretreatment method combining freezing/thawing with Geobacillus sp. G1 was employed to pretreat waste activated sludge (WAS) for enhancing the WAS hydrolysis and subsequent short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. Results showed that freezing/thawing combined with Geobacillus sp. G1 pretreatment achieved the maximal concentrations of soluble protein from 40+/-6mg COD/L (non-pretreated) to 1226+/-24mg COD/L (pretreated), and accumulated SCFAs concentration increased from 248+/-81mg COD/L to 3032+/-53mg COD/L. Excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the highest fluorescence intensity (FI) of protein-like substances, which was the dominant fluorescent organic matters, indicating the synergistic effect of freezing/thawing and Geobacillus sp. G1 pretreatment on organics hydrolysis. High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis investigated that the abundance of bacteria responsible for WAS hydrolysis (such as Clostridium and Caloramator) and SCFAs production (such as Parabacteroides and Bacterodies) was greatly enhanced due to the novel pretreatment method used.
TI  - Biohydrogen production from a novel alkalophilic isolate Clostridium sp. IODB-O3.
AB  - Hydrogen producing bacteria IODB-O3 was isolated from sludge and identified as Clostridium sp. by 16S rDNA gene analysis. In this study, biohydrogen production process was developed using low-cost agro-waste. Maximum H2 was produced at 37 degrees C and pH 8.5. Maximum H2 yield was obtained 2.54+/-0.2mol-H2/mol-reducing sugar from wheat straw pre-hydrolysate (WSPH) and 2.61+/-0.1mol-H2/mol-reducing sugar from pre-treated wheat straw enzymatic-hydrolysate (WSEH). The cumulative H2 production (ml/L), 3680+/-105 and 3270+/-100, H2 production rate (ml/L/h), 153+/-5 and 136+/-5, and specific H2 production (ml/g/h), 511+/-5 and 681+/-10 with WSPH and WSEH were obtained, respectively. Biomass pre-treatment via steam-explosion generates ample amount of WSPH which remains unutilized for bioethanol production due to non-availability of efficient C5-fermenting microorganisms. This study shows that Clostridium sp. IODB-O3 is capable of utilizing WSPH efficiently for biohydrogen production. This would lead to reduced economic constrain on the overall cellulosic ethanol process and also establish a sustainable biohydrogen production process.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the ability of Clostridium clariflavum strains and Clostridium thermocellum to utilize hemicellulose and unpretreated plant material.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among themophilic consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) candidate organisms, environmental isolates of Clostridium clariflavum have demonstrated the ability to grow on xylan, and the genome of C. clariflavum DSM 19732 has revealed a number of mechanisms that foster solubilization of hemicellulose that are distinctive relative to the model cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum. RESULTS: Growth experiments on xylan, xylooligosaccharides, and xylose reveal that C. clariflavum strains are able to completely break down xylan to xylose and that the environmental strain C. clariflavum sp. 4-2a is able to grow on monomeric xylose. C. clariflavum strains were able to utilize a larger proportion of unpretreated switchgrass, and solubilize a higher proportion of glucan, xylan, and arabinan, with strain 4-2a reaching the highest extent of solubilization of these components (64.7 to 69.4%) compared to C. thermocellum (29.5 to 42.5%). In addition, glycome immunoanalyses of residual plant biomass reveal differences in the extent of degradation of easily accessible xylans, with C. clariflavum strains having increased solubilization of this fraction of xylans relative to C. thermocellum. CONCLUSIONS: C. clariflavum strains exhibit higher activity than C. thermocellum in the breakdown of hemicellulose and are capable of degrading xylan to xylooligomers and xylose. This capability seems to also play a role in the higher levels of utilization of unpretreated plant material.
TI  - Alert microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in Malopolskie province  in 2010-2012.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare centers undertake supervisory activities to control health  care-associated infections (HCAIs) by elaborating procedures, identifying alert microorganisms and analyzing data collected. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of alert microorganisms in hospital wards in 2010-2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Legislation which is in force since several years introduced the principles of health care-associated infections control and reporting system. Analysis was based on annual reports on alert microorganisms provided by 19 District Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations from Malopolskie province. The data discuss positive tests results for alert microorganisms in patients who stayed in hospitals supervised by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations. RESULTS: Compared to 2010-2011, the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012 was lower, amounting to 24 (2010 - 44, 2011 - 34). Of these tests, the majority was performed in the following wards: transplantology (2010 - 339, 2011 - 354, 2012 - 330), burn care (2010 - 354, 2011 - 148, 2012 - 113) and ICUs for adults (2010 - 155, 2011 - 157, 2012 - 140). In 2010-2012, an increase in the number of positive test results for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL+) and Clostridium difficile as well as slight decrease in the number of positive test results for other alert microorganisms were noted. The highest number of microorganisms was identified in neonatal and neonatal pathology (Enterobacteriaceae ESBL+); pediatric and infectious diseases (Rotavirus); infectious diseases (Rotavirus, C.difficile); burn care (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas sp.) and ophthalmic and hemodialysis wards (MRSA). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of a decrease in the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012, a high number of positive test results for alert microorganisms was observed. It suggests the necessity for wider application of collected data as to improve monitoring of infections and reduce resulting threats.
TI  - The effect of mouthwashes containing biguanides on the progression of erosion in  dentin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental erosion is caused by frequent exposure to acids without the involvement of microorganism. This study analyzed the effect of biguanides (polyhexamethylene biguanide - PHMB and chlorhexidine - CHX) on dentin erosion due to their possible influence on the enzymatic degradation of the demineralized organic matrix. METHOD: Sixty bovine dentin specimens were prepared. On both sides of their surface, nail varnish was applied to maintain the reference surfaces for the determination of dentin loss. Samples were cyclically de- and remineralized for 6 days. Demineralization was performed with a 0.87 M citric acid solution (6x5 min daily). Thereafter, samples were treated with distilled water (negative control), 0.12% CHX (positive control), 0.07% PHMB, Sanifill Perio Premium (0.07% PHMB plus 0.05% NaF), or F solution (0.05% NaF) for 1 min and then subjected to enzymatic challenge for 10 min using a bacterial collagenase (Clostridium hystoliticum, 100 mug/ml). Dentin loss was assessed using profilometry (mum) daily. Data were analyzed using 2-way repeated measures-ANOVA and Bonferroni's test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Dentin loss progressed significantly for all groups during the 6 days. After the 3rd day, Sanifill Premium, CHX, and PHMB significantly reduced dentin erosion compared to control. On the 6th day, the lowest mean (+/-SD) dentin loss was observed for Sanifill Perio Premium (94.4 +/- 3.9 mum). PHMB and CHX led to intermediate dentin loss (129.9 +/- 41.2 and 135.3 +/- 33.5 mum, respectively) that was significantly lower than those found for negative control (168.2 +/- 6.2 mum). F (157.4 +/- 6.1 mum) did not significantly differ from negative control. CONCLUSIONS: Sanifill Perio Premium mouthwash has a good potential to reduce dentin loss, which might be associated with the presence of PHMB.
TI  - Community analysis of plant biomass-degrading microorganisms from Obsidian Pool,  Yellowstone National Park.
AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels can potentially be improved by employing robust microorganisms and enzymes that efficiently deconstruct plant polysaccharides at elevated temperatures. Many of the geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) are surrounded by vegetation providing a source of allochthonic material to support heterotrophic microbial communities adapted to utilize plant biomass as a primary carbon and energy source. In this study, a well-known hot spring environment, Obsidian Pool (OBP), was examined for potential biomass-active microorganisms using cultivation-independent and enrichment techniques. Analysis of 33,684 archaeal and 43,784 bacterial quality-filtered 16S rRNA gene pyrosequences revealed that archaeal diversity in the main pool was higher than bacterial; however, in the vegetated area, overall bacterial diversity was significantly higher. Of notable interest was a flooded depression adjacent to OBP supporting a stand of Juncus tweedyi, a heat-tolerant rush commonly found growing near geothermal features in YNP. The microbial community from heated sediments surrounding the plants was enriched in members of the Firmicutes including potentially (hemi)cellulolytic bacteria from the genera Clostridium, Anaerobacter, Caloramator, Caldicellulosiruptor, and Thermoanaerobacter. Enrichment cultures containing model and real biomass substrates were established at a wide range of temperatures (55-85 degrees C). Microbial activity was observed up to 80 degrees C on all substrates including Avicel, xylan, switchgrass, and Populus sp. Independent of substrate, Caloramator was enriched at lower (<65 degrees C) temperatures while highly active cellulolytic bacteria Caldicellulosiruptor were dominant at high (>65 degrees C) temperatures.
TI  - Intestine-derived Clostridium leptum induces murine tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells in vitro.
AB  - Patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases frequently present with reduced numbers and functionally impaired regulatory T cells (Tregs) and/or tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs). tDC-mediated regulation of Treg proliferation (numbers) and activation is crucial to establishing and maintaining an appropriate level of immune tolerance. Colonic colonization of Clostridium spp. is associated with accumulation of Tregs, which inhibits development of inflammatory lesions. To investigate whether infection with the Clostridium leptum sp. can specifically induce Tregs and/or tDCs bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of C. leptum then co-cultured with CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells or not. Changes in tDC numbers, Treg numbers, percentages of T cell subsets, and expression of cytokines related to Tregs (IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1)), DCs (IL-12p40 and IL-6) and effector T cells (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A) were measured. In the co-culture system, C. leptum-stimulated tDCs were able to increase the percentage and total number of Tregs attenuate activation of T helper cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17), and decrease the amount of secreted IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-gamma and IL-17A. Thus, C. leptum exposure can induce the tDC-mediated stimulation of Tregs while disrupting the immune inflammatory response mediated by Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells.
TI  - The influence of whole grain products and red meat on intestinal microbiota composition in normal weight adults: a randomized crossover intervention trial.
AB  - Intestinal microbiota is related to obesity and serum lipid levels, both risk factors for chronic diseases constituting a challenge for public health. We investigated how a diet rich in whole grain (WG) products and red meat (RM) influences microbiota. During a 10-week crossover intervention study, 20 healthy adults consumed two isocaloric diets, one rich in WG products and one high in RM. Repeatedly data on microbiota were assessed by 16S rRNA based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A blood sample and anthropometric data were collected. Mixed models and logistic regression were used to investigate effects. Microbiota showed interindividual variability. However, dietary interventions modified microbiota appearance: 8 bands changed in at least 4 participants during the interventions. One of the bands appearing after WG and one increasing after RM remained significant in regression models and were identified as Collinsella aerofaciens and Clostridium sp. The WG intervention lowered obesity parameters, while the RM diet increased serum levels of uric acid and creatinine. The study showed that diet is a component of major relevance regarding its influence on intestinal microbiota and that WG has an important role for health. The results could guide investigations of diet and microbiota in observational prospective cohort studies. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01449383.
TI  - Revealing the factors influencing a fermentative biohydrogen production process using industrial wastewater as fermentation substrate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biohydrogen production through dark fermentation using organic waste  as a substrate has gained increasing attention in recent years, mostly because of the economic advantages of coupling renewable, clean energy production with biological waste treatment. An ideal approach is the use of selected microbial inocula that are able to degrade complex organic substrates with simultaneous biohydrogen generation. Unfortunately, even with a specifically designed starting inoculum, there is still a number of parameters, mostly with regard to the fermentation conditions, that need to be improved in order to achieve a viable, large-scale, and technologically feasible solution. In this study, statistics-based factorial experimental design methods were applied to investigate the impact of various biological, physical, and chemical parameters, as well as the interactions between them on the biohydrogen production rates. RESULTS: By developing and applying a central composite experimental design strategy, the effects of the independent variables on biohydrogen production were determined. The initial pH value was shown to have the largest effect on the biohydrogen production process. High-throughput sequencing-based metagenomic assessments of microbial communities revealed a clear shift towards a Clostridium sp.-dominated environment, as the responses of the variables investigated were maximized towards the highest H2-producing potential. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that the microbial consortium largely followed hydrogen-generating metabolic pathways, with the simultaneous degradation of complex organic compounds, and thus also performed a biological treatment of the beer brewing industry wastewater used as a fermentation substrate. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we have developed a complex optimization strategy for batch-mode biohydrogen production using a defined microbial consortium as the starting inoculum and beer brewery wastewater as the fermentation substrate. These results have the potential to bring us closer to an optimized, industrial-scale system which will serve the dual purpose of wastewater pre-treatment and concomitant biohydrogen production.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Ralstonia eutropha for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates from sucrose.
AB  - A sucrose utilization pathway was established in Ralstonia eutropha NCIMB11599 and R. eutropha 437-540 by introducing the Mannheimia succiniciproducens MBEL55E sacC gene that encodes beta-fructofuranosidase. These engineered strains were examined for the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)], respectively, from sucrose as a carbon source. It was found that beta-fructofuranosidase excreted into the culture medium could hydrolyze sucrose to glucose and fructose, which were efficiently used as carbon sources by recombinant R. eutropha strains. When R. eutropha NCIMB11599 expressing the sacC gene was cultured in nitrogen-free chemically defined medium containing 20 g/L of sucrose, a high P(3HB) content of 73.2 wt% could be obtained. In addition, R. eutropha 437-540 expressing the Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 phaC1437 gene and the Clostridium propionicum pct540 gene accumulated P(3HB-co-21.5 mol% LA) to a polymer content of 19.5 wt% from sucrose by the expression of the sacC gene and the Escherichia coli ldhA gene. The molecular weights of P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-21.5 mol%LA) synthesized in R. eutropha using sucrose as a carbon source were 3.52 x 10(5) (Mn ) and 2.19 x 10(4) (Mn ), respectively. The engineered R. eutropha strains reported here will be useful for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from sucrose, one of the most abundant and relatively inexpensive carbon sources.
TI  - Identification of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes from within an  infant gut functional metagenomic library.
AB  - The infant gut microbiota develops rapidly during the first 2 years of life, acquiring microorganisms from diverse sources. During this time, significant opportunities exist for the infant to acquire antibiotic resistant bacteria, which can become established and constitute the infant gut resistome. With increased antibiotic resistance limiting our ability to treat bacterial infections, investigations into resistance reservoirs are highly pertinent. This study aimed to explore the nascent resistome in antibiotically-naive infant gut microbiomes, using a combination of metagenomic approaches. Faecal samples from 22 six-month-old infants without previous antibiotic exposure were used to construct a pooled metagenomic library, which was functionally screened for ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. Our library of approximately 220Mb contained 0.45 ampicillin resistant hits/Mb and 0.059 gentamicin resistant hits/Mb. PCR-based analysis of fosmid clones and uncloned metagenomic DNA, revealed a diverse and abundant aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir within the infant gut, with resistance determinants exhibiting homology to those found in common gut inhabitants, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., and Clostridium difficile, as well as to genes from cryptic environmental bacteria. Notably, the genes identified differed from those revealed when a sequence-driven PCR-based screen of metagenomic DNA was employed. Carriage of these antibiotic resistance determinants conferred substantial, but varied (2-512x), increases in antibiotic resistance to their bacterial host. These data provide insights into the infant gut resistome, revealing the presence of a varied aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance reservoir even in the absence of selective pressure, confirming the infant resistome establishes early in life, perhaps even at birth.
TI  - Dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned Huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  - The improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. The present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (SBOS) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. Ten Huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% SBOS (experimental group). The results showed that dietary supplementation with SBOS increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (P < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium sp, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia). Soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (P < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., Escherichia coli, Clostridium, and Streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). In addition, SBOS supplementation increased (P < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger RNA, and it decreased (P < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger RNA in the ileum and colon. These findings suggest that SBOS supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned Huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.
TI  - 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis, and mass spectrometry identification of the proposed new species "Clostridium neonatale".
AB  - In 2002, an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis in a Canadian neonatal intensive care unit was associated with a proposed novel species of Clostridium, "Clostridium neonatale." To date, there are no data about the isolation, identification, or clinical significance of this species. Additionally, C. neonatale has not been formally classified as a new species, rendering its identification challenging. Indeed, the C. neonatale 16S rRNA gene sequence shows high similarity to another Clostridium species involved in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, Clostridium butyricum. By performing a polyphasic study combining phylogenetic analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analysis) and phenotypic characterization with mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that C. neonatale is a new species within the Clostridium genus sensu stricto, for which we propose the name Clostridium neonatale sp. nov. Now that the status of C. neonatale has been clarified, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used for better differential identification of C. neonatale and C. butyricum clinical isolates. This is necessary to precisely define the role and clinical significance of C. neonatale, a species that may have been misidentified and underrepresented during previous neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis studies.
TI  - Clostridium huakuii sp. nov., an anaerobic, acetogenic bacterium isolated from methanogenic consortia.
AB  - A Gram-staining-positive, spore-forming, obligately anaerobic, acetogenic bacterium, designated LAM1030(T), was isolated from methanogenic consortia enriched from biogas slurry collected from the large-scale anaerobic digester of Modern Farming Corporation in Hebei Province, China. Cells of strain LAM1030(T) were motile, straight or spiral-rod-shaped. Strain LAM1030(T) could utilize glucose, fructose, maltose, galactose, lactose, sucrose, cellobiose, mannitol, pyruvate, succinic acid and tryptophan as the sole carbon source. Acetic acid, isovaleric acid and butanoic acid were the main products of glucose fermentation. Sodium sulfite was used as an electron acceptor. Growth of strain LAM1030(T) was completely inhibited by the addition of ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin or erythromycin at a concentration of 20 microg ml(-1). The main polar lipids of strain LAM1030(T) were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, 11 unknown glycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. No respiratory quinone was detected. The major fatty acids of strain LAM1030(T) were C16 : 0 (21.1 %), C14 : 0 (10.3 %), summed feature 9 (including C16:0 10-methyl and/or iso-C17:1 omega9c) (11.3% ), summed feature 3 (including C16:1 omega7c and/or C16:1 omega6c) (10.6% ) and iso-C15 : 0 (6.6 %). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain LAM1030(T) belonged to the genus Clostridium and was most closely related to Clostridium subterminale DSM 6970(T), Clostridium thiosulfatireducens DSM 13105(T) and Clostridium sulfidigenes DSM 18982(T), with 97.0, 96.9 and 96.8 % similarity, respectively. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain LAM1030(T) was 31.2+/-0.3 mol%. On the basis of its phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic characterization, strain LAM1030(T) is suggested to represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium huakuii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LAM1030(T) ( = ACCC 00698(T) = JCM 19186(T)).
TI  - Shifts in microbiota species and fermentation products in a dietary model enriched in fat and sucrose.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract harbours a 'superorganism' called the gut microbiota,  which is known to play a crucial role in the onset and development of diverse diseases. This internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. Feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (HFS) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of Western societies. The aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolic changes produced in male Wistar rats fed a HFS diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. For this purpose, DNA extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the V4-V6 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Short-chain fatty acids, i.e. acetate, propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) and class level (Erisypelotrichi, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Bacilli). Interestingly, the class Clostridia showed a significant decrease after HFS diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. Of particular interest, Clostridium cluster XIVa species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (Mitsuokella jalaludinii, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridium sp. FCB90-3, Prevotella nanceiensis, Clostridium fusiformis, Clostridium sp. BNL1100 and Eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. These results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.
TI  - Non contiguous-finished genome sequence and description of Clostridium jeddahense sp. nov.
AB  - Clostridium jeddahense strain JCD(T) (= CSUR P693 = DSM 27834) is the type strain of C. jeddahense sp. nov. This strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from the fecal flora of an obese 24 year-old Saudian male (BMI=52 kg/m(2)). Clostridium jeddahense strain JCD(T) is an obligate Gram-positive bacillus. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 3,613,503 bp long genome (1 chromosome, no plasmid) exhibits a G+C content of 51.95% and contains 3,462 protein-coding and 53 RNA genes, including 4 rRNA genes.
TI  - Investigation on antibacterial and antioxidant activities, phenolic and flavonoid contents of some thai edible plants as an alternative for antibiotics.
AB  - This study was aimed to examine the antibacterial and antioxidative properties of seven edible plants from Thailand to develop alternative antibiotics as feed additives. The plants include Citrus aurantifolia Swingle (Lime) fruits and its leaves, Sesbania grandiflora L. (Agati sesbania) leaves, Piper sarmentosum Roxb (Wild betal) leaves, Curcuma domestica Valeton (Turmeric) roots, Morinda citrifolia L. (Beach mulberry) leaves, Cassia siamea britt (Siamea cassia) leaves, and Cocos nucifera L. (Coconut) peels. The plants were extracted by methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Antibacterial activities with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined by agar diffusion assay against Escherichia coli, Burkholderia sp., Haemopilus somnus, Haemopilus parasuis, and Clostridium perfringens that were considered pathogenic strains in livestock infection. Methanol extracts of C. aurantifolia Swingle fruits and leaves showed the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activities except for C. perfringens. Butanol extract of S. grandiflora L. leaves showed the strongest activity against Burkholderia sp. with MIC, 135 mug/mL. P. sarmentosum Roxb leaves showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, Burkholderia sp. and H. parasuis. Ethyl acetate and water extracts from C. domesitca Valeton roots showed MIC of 306 mug/mL and 183 mug/mL, respectively against only C. perfringens. Antioxidative activity was determined by 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl photometric assay. The methanol extracts of C. aurantifolia Swingle fruits and P. sarmentosum Roxb leaves showed the highest antioxidant activity among all the extracts with 3.46 mg/mL and 2.70 mg/mL effective concentration 50% (EC50) values, respectively. Total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were measured from the plant extracts. Methanol extracts of S. grandiflora L. and chloroform extracts of C. domestica Valeton were found to have the highest amount of total phenolics, 41.7 and 47.8 mug/mL, respectively. Flavonoid content of methanol extracts in S. grandiflora L. T was 22.5 mug/mL and the highest among plant extracts tested. These results indicated that C. aurantifolia Swingle, S. grandiflora L., P. sarmentosum Roxb, and C. domestica Valeton have antibacterial and antioxidant activities and can be used as alternative antibiotics or potential feed additives for the control of animal pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  - Propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. Twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of Brazilian cow rumen contents in the presence of different propolis extracts (LLOS), were characterized using phenotyping and 16S rRNA identification. Seven strains were assigned to Streptococcus sp., most likely S. bovis, and were all degrading starch. One amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of Selenomonas ruminantium was also found. Two strains of Clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. Two strains were assigned to Mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. One strain belonged to a Bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with Escherichia coli. All of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. The effect of three propolis extracts (LLOS B1, C1 and C3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates of S. bovis, E. coli, M. jalaludinii and C. bifermentans. The growth of S. bovis, E. coli and M. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). C. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this LLOS concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. LLOS C3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was a little less inhibitory than B1 and C1 on this strain.
TI  - Clostridium algifaecis sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterial species from decomposing  algal scum.
AB  - Two anaerobic bacterial strains, MB9-7(T) and MB9-9, were isolated from decomposing algal scum and were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains MB9-7(T) and MB9-9 are closely related to each other (99.7% similarity) and they are also closely related to Clostridium tyrobutyricum (96.5%). The two strains were Gram-stain positive and rod-shaped. Growth occurred at 20-45 degrees C, at pH 4.0-8.0 and at NaCl concentrations of up to 2% (w/v). Acid was produced from glucose, xylose and mannose. Products of fermentation in PYG medium were mainly butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C(14:0) and C(16:0). The cellular polar lipids comprised phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two glycolipids, one phospholipid, one aminophospholipid and two aminolipids. The DNA G+C contents of strain MB9-7(T) and MB9-9 were 27.9 and 28.7 mol%, respectively. These results support the assignment of the new isolates to the genus Clostridium and also distinguish them from other species of the genus Clostridium. Hence, it is proposed that strains MB9-7(T) and MB9-9 represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium, with the suggested name Clostridium algifaecis sp. nov. The type strain is MB9-7(T) ( =CGMCC 1.5188(T) =DSM 28783(T)).
TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Clostridium swellfunianum sp. nov., a novel anaerobic bacterium isolated from the pit mud of Chinese Luzhou-flavor liquor production.
AB  - A novel Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain S11-3-10(T), was isolated from the pit mud used for Chinese Luzhou-flavor liquor production. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the strain formed a monophyletic clade with the closely related type strains of Clostridium cluster I and was most closely related to Clostridium amylolyticum JCM 14823(T) (94.38%). The temperature, pH, and NaCl range for growth was determined to be 20-45 degrees C (optimum 37 degrees C), 4.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.3), and 0-3.0% (w/v), respectively. The strain was able to tolerate up to 7.5 % (v/v) ethanol. Yeast extract or peptone was found to be required for growth. Acids were found to be produced from glucose, mannose and trehalose. The major end products from glucose fermentation were identified as ethanol, acetate and hydrogen. The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and unidentified phospholipids and polar lipids. The major fatty acids (>5%) were identified as iso-C(15:0), C(16:0), C(16:0)dma, C(14:0), anteiso-C(15:0) and iso-C(13:0). No respiratory quinone was detected. The diamino acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan was identified as meso-diaminopimelic acid and the whole-cell sugars were found to include galactose and glucose as major components. The DNA G+C content was determined to be 36.4 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic evidence, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium for which the name Clostridium swellfunianum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is S11-3-10(T) (=DSM 27788(T) = JCM 19606(T) = CICC 10730(T)).
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two commercial multiplex panels for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens by use of clinical stool specimens.
AB  - The detection of pathogens associated with gastrointestinal disease may be important in certain patient populations, such as immunocompromised hosts, the critically ill, or individuals with prolonged disease that is refractory to treatment. In this study, we evaluated two commercially available multiplex panels (the FilmArray gastrointestinal [GI] panel [BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT] and the Luminex xTag gastrointestinal pathogen panel [GPP] [Luminex Corporation, Toronto, Canada]) using Cary-Blair stool samples (n = 500) submitted to our laboratory for routine GI testing (e.g., culture, antigen testing, microscopy, and individual real-time PCR). At the time of this study, the prototype (non-FDA-cleared) FilmArray GI panel targeted 23 pathogens (14 bacterial, 5 viral, and 4 parasitic), and testing of 200 mul of Cary-Blair stool was recommended. In contrast, the Luminex GPP assay was FDA cleared for the detection of 11 pathogens (7 bacterial, 2 viral, and 2 parasitic), but had the capacity to identify 4 additional pathogens using a research-use-only protocol. Importantly, the Luminex assay was FDA cleared for 100 mul raw stool; however, 100 mul Cary-Blair stool was tested by the Luminex assay in this study. Among 230 prospectively collected samples, routine testing was positive for one or more GI pathogens in 19 (8.3%) samples, compared to 76 (33.0%) by the FilmArray and 69 (30.3%) by the Luminex assay. Clostridium difficile (12.6 to 13.9% prevalence) and norovirus genogroup I (GI)/GII (5.7 to 13.9% prevalence) were two of the pathogens most commonly detected by both assays among prospective samples. Sapovirus was also commonly detected (5.7% positive rate) by the FilmArray assay. Among 270 additional previously characterized samples, both multiplex panels demonstrated high sensitivity (>90%) for the majority of targets, with the exception of several pathogens, notably Aeromonas sp. (23.8%) by FilmArray and Yersinia enterocolitica (48.1%) by the Luminex assay. Interestingly, the FilmArray and Luminex panels identified mixed infections in 21.1% and 13.0% of positive prospective samples, respectively, compared to only 8.3% by routine methods.
TI  - Genome sequencing of multidrug resistant novel Clostridium sp. BL8 reveals its potential for pathogenicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome is important for maintaining the health status of the host. Clostridia are key members of the human gut microbiome, carrying out several important functions in the gut environment. Hence understanding the role of different Clostridium species isolated from human gut is essential. The present study was aimed at investigating the role of novel Clostridium sp. isolate BL8 in human gut using genome sequencing as a tool. FINDINGS: The genome analysis of Clostridium sp. BL8 showed the presence of several adaptive features like bile resistance, presence of sensory and regulatory systems, presence of oxidative stress managing systems and presence of membrane transport systems. The genome of Clostridium sp. BL8 consists of a wide variety of virulence factors like phospholipase C (alpha toxin), hemolysin, aureolysin and exfoliative toxin A, as well as adhesion factors, proteases, Type IV secretion system and antibiotic resistance genes. In vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing showed that Clostridium sp. BL8 was resistant to 11 different tested antibiotics belonging to 6 different classes. The cell cytotoxicity assay confirmed the cytotoxic effect of Clostridium sp. BL8 cells, which killed 40% of the Vero cells after 4 hrs of incubation. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium sp. BL8 has adapted for survival in human gut environment, with presence of different adaptive features. The presence of several virulence factors and cell cytotoxic activity indicate that Clostridium sp. BL8 has a potential to cause infections in humans, however further in vivo studies are necessary to ascertain this fact.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea by Clostridium difficile in hematologic patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients: risk factors for severe forms and death.
AB  - We describe the rate of incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in hematologic and patients undergone stem cell transplant (HSCT) at HC-FMUSP, from January 2007 to June 2011, using two denominators 1,000 patient and 1,000 days of neutropenia and the risk factors associated with the severe form of the disease and death. The ELISA method (Ridascreen-Biopharm, Germany) for the detections of toxins A/B was used to identify C. difficile. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate potential factors associated with severe CDAD and death within 14 days after the diagnosis of CDAD, using multiple logistic regression. Sixty-six episodes were identified in 64 patients among 439 patients with diarrhea during the study period. CDA rate of incidence varied from 0.78 to 5.45 per 1,000 days of neutropenia and from 0.65 to 5.45 per 1,000 patient-days. The most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia 30/64 (44%), 32/64 (46%) patients were neutropenic, 31/64 (45%) undergone allogeneic HSCT, 61/64 (88%) had previously used antibiotics and 9/64 (13%) have severe CDAD. Most of the patients (89%) received treatment with oral metronidazole and 19/64 (26%) died. The independent risk factors associated with death were the severe form of CDAD, and use of linezolid.
TI  - Clostridium vulturis sp. nov., isolated from the intestine of the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus).
AB  - A Gram-stain positive, strict anaerobe, spore-forming, motile rod-shaped bacterial strain with peritrichous flagella, designated YMB-57(T), was isolated from the intestine of a cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) in Korea. Strain YMB-57(T) was found to show optimal growth at 37 degrees C, pH 7.5 and 1.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain YMB-57(T) belongs to the genus Clostridium and is most closely related to the type strains of Clostridium subterminale (96.9 % sequence similarity), Clostridium thiosulfatireducens (96.7 %) and Clostridium sulfidigenes (96.6 %). The main fermentation end-products identified following growth in PYG medium were acetate, butyrate, ethanol, propanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Peptone was converted to ethanol, and butanol, whereas glucose was fermented to ethanol. The major cellular fatty acids were identified as C16:0, C18:1 omega9c, and C18:1 omega9c DMA and the DNA G+C content was determined to be 34.0 mol%. Phenotypic and phylogenetic differences indicate that strain YMB-57(T) is distinct from other Clostridium species. It is proposed that strain YMB-57(T) be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Clostridium, with the name Clostridium vulturis sp. nov. The type strain is YMB-57(T) (=KCTC 15114(T) = JCM 17998(T)).
TI  - Effect of Feeding Bacillus subtilis natto on Hindgut Fermentation and Microbiota  of Holstein Dairy Cows.
AB  - The effect of Bacillus subtilis natto on hindgut fermentation and microbiota of early lactation Holstein dairy cows was investigated in this study. Thirty-six Holstein dairy cows in early lactation were randomly allocated to three groups: no B. subtilis natto as the control group, B. subtilis natto with 0.5x10(11) cfu as DMF1 group and B. subtilis natto with 1.0x10(11) cfu as DMF2 group. After 14 days of adaptation period, the formal experiment was started and lasted for 63 days. Fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of each animal on the morning at the end of eighth week and placed into sterile plastic bags. The pH, NH3-N and VFA concentration were determined and fecal bacteria DNA was extracted and analyzed by DGGE. The results showed that the addition of B. subtilus natto at either treatment level resulted in a decrease in fecal NH3-N concentration but had no effect on fecal pH and VFA. The DGGE profile revealed that B. subtilis natto affected the population of fecal bacteria. The diversity index of Shannon-Wiener in DFM1 decreased significantly compared to the control. Fecal Alistipes sp., Clostridium sp., Roseospira sp., beta proteobacterium were decreased and Bifidobacterium was increased after supplementing with B. subtilis natto. This study demonstrated that B. subtilis natto had a tendency to change fecal microbiota balance.
TI  - 5-Aminosalicylic Acid Inhibits Acute Clostridium difficile Toxin A-Induced Colitis in Rats.
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) inhibits toxin A-induced generation of colonic leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and toxin A colitis in rats. Isolated colonic segments in anesthetized rats were treated intraluminally with toxin A for 3 hours with or without 30 minutes of pretreatment with either 5-ASA or sulfapyridine and then colonic tissue levels of LTB4 were measured and inflammation was assessed. Separately, sulfasalazine was administered to rats in their drinking water for 5 days, isolated colonic segments were then prepared, toxin A was administered, and inflammation was assessed as before. Pretreatment with 5-ASA inhibited toxin A-induced increased tissue LTB4 concentration in the colon. Sulfasalazine and 5-ASA but not sulfapyridine significantly inhibited toxin A colitis. However, pretreatment with 5-ASA did not protect against direct TRPV1-mediated colitis caused by capsaicin. Toxin A stimulated the release of substance P (SP), and this effect was also inhibited by sulfasalazine and 5-ASA but not by sulfapyridine. Thus, toxin A stimulates colonic LTB4 resulting in activation of TRPV1, release of SP, and colitis. Inhibition of 5-LO by 5-ASA disrupts this pathway and supports the concept that LTB4 activation of TRPV1 plays a role in toxin A colitis.
TI  - Composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some Acinos Miller species.
AB  - GC and GC/MS analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six Acinos Miller species from Serbia and Montenegro were performed. Seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. The common feature of the A. suaveolens, A. majoranifolius and A. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the A. graveolens, A. arvensis and A. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. The total flavonoids, polyphenols and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of A. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. A disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium pyogenes, Enterococcus sp., Micrococcus flavus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli; fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of A. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Effects of dietary supplementation with Gynura procumbens (Merr.) on egg yolk cholesterol, excreta microflora and laying hen performance.
AB  - Abstract 1. The present study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with Gynura procumbens on egg yolk and serum cholesterol and triglycerides, excreta microflora, laying performance and egg quality. 2. A total of 160 Hy-Line Brown layers (45 weeks old) were randomly assigned into 4 treatments on the basis of laying performance. Each treatment had 4 replicates with 10 birds each. 3. Dietary treatments were basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 g/kg diet G. procumbens during 56-d feeding period. 4. Serum (d 21, 42 and 56) and egg yolk (d 28, 42 and 56) cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were linearly reduced with increasing dietary concentrations of G. procumbens. 5. Increasing dietary concentrations of G. procumbens linearly reduced the excreta total anaerobic bacteria (d 28), Clostridium sp. and Escherichia coli (d 28 and 56) populations. 6. Overall egg production and egg mass were linearly increased, and overall feed efficiency was linearly improved with increase in dietary G. procumbens. 7. Dietary increasing concentrations of G. procumbens linearly improved egg yolk colour (d 28 and 56) and breaking strength of eggs (d 56). 8. The results obtained in the present experiment indicate that dietary supplementation with G. procumbens could reduce the egg yolk cholesterol, suppresses harmful excreta microflora and improves layers performance.
TI  - [Biodiversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria growing on objects of heating systems].
AB  - It was shown that sulfate-reducing bacteria developed on the sections of Kyiv municipal heating systems, which are exploited in conditions of different temperatures. The bacteria were different as to their morphological and physiological properties. The bacteria of Desulfovibrio genus were revealed on the sections, which were exploited at a temperature of 35-40 degrees C and bacteria of Desulfomicrobium and Desulfotomaculum genera were revealed on the sections with a higher temperature such as 60 degrees C. Based on of the 16S rRNA gene analysis data, it was demonstrated that sequences of TC2, TC3 and TC4 clones related to Desulfovibrio sp. DSM 12803 (100% sequence similarity), Desulfotomaculum sp. ECP-C-5 (92% sequence similarity) and Desulfomicrobium baculatum strain DSM 2555 (99% sequence similarity), respectively. The identified bacteria are potentially dangerous for heating systems and can be the agents of microbial corrosion.
TI  - Infection with Devriesea agamarum and Chrysosporium guarroi in an inland bearded  dragon (Pogona vitticeps).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Description of clinical, microbiological and histopathological findings in a case of deep dermatitis in an inland bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) caused by Devriesea agamarum and Chrysosporium guarroi. CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old male inland bearded dragon, weighing 497 g, was presented at the clinic because the animal was suffering from dysecdysis and chronic skin lesions. Large numbers of bacilli, cocci and hyphal elements were diagnosed during the microscopic examination of the wound exudate. Microbiological analysis of a skin specimen revealed a moderate growth of Enterococcus sp. and D. agamarum. The condition of the bearded dragon improved with combined therapy consisting of ceftiofur hydrochloride, voriconazole and meloxicam. However, 3 months later recrudescence was observed. This time, Clostridium sp. and Chrysosporium sp. were isolated in large numbers. The bearded dragon was euthanized. Histopathology confirmed a severe granulomatous dermatitis with associated fungal hyphae and a severe granulomatous hepatitis with intralesional hyphae. Chrysosporium guarroi was identified by PCR and sequencing in two organs (skin and liver). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This is the first case of an infection with D. agamarum and C. guarroi in an inland bearded dragon (P. vitticeps). It emphasizes the importance of mycological cultures and specific treatment. Samples of suspected Chrysosporium sp. should be cultured at 30 degrees C for 10-14 days. Early antifungal treatment is necessary to prevent systemic and potentially fatal infection with C. guarroi.
TI  - A novel esterase from Paenibacillus sp. PBS-2 is a new member of the beta-lactamase belonging to the family VIII lipases/esterases.
AB  - Screening of a gene library from Paenibacillus sp. PBS-2 generated in Escherichia coli led to the identification of a clone with lipolytic activity. Sequence analysis showed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 378 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 42 kDa. The esterase displayed 69% and 42% identity with the putative beta-lactamases from Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 and Clostridium sp. BNL1100, respectively. The esterase contained a Serx- x-Lys motif that is conserved among all beta-lactamases found to date. The protein PBS-2 was produced in both soluble and insoluble forms when E. coli cells harboring the gene were cultured at 18 degrees C. The enzyme is a serine protein and was active against p-nitrophenyl esters of C2, C4, C8, and C10. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were pH 9.0 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Relative activity of 55% remained at up to 5 degrees C with an activation energy of 5.84 kcal/mol, which indicates that the enzyme is cold-adapted. Enzyme activity was inhibited by Cd(2+), Cu(2+), and Hg(2+) ions. As expected for a serine esterase, activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The enzyme was remarkably active and stable in the presence of commercial detergents and organic solvents. This cold-adapted esterase has potential as a biocatalyst and detergent additive for use at low temperatures.
TI  - Solution phase dynamics of the DNA repair enzyme spore photoproduct lyase as probed by H/D exchange.
AB  - Spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) catalyzes the repair of the UV lesion spore photoproduct (SP) in a reaction dependent on S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). We have utilized H/D exchange to show that in the presence of SAM, a significant reduction in H/D exchange is observed upon binding SPTpT or undamaged oligonucleotide, indicating a shift of 20 or 10 amide protons, respectively, from a rapidly-exchangable state to a fully-protected conformation. In the absence of SAM, neither the oligonucleotide nor the SPTpT produce a significant perturbation in H/D exchange, indicating SAM is a requisite binding partner. Performing the same experiments in aerobic conditions reduced the magnitude of ligand-induced structural changes, consistent with the importance of the oxygen-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster for SAM and substrate binding.
TI  - Analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  - Calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in Astragali Radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. However, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, five strains including Bacteroides sp.13, and sp.58, Clostridium sp.21-2, Veillonella sp.43-1, and Bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to convert calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. A total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. On the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium were less severely affected. This indicates that calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.
TI  - 1,3-propanediol production with Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579: effect of a dhaD  knock-out.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 1,3-propanediol (PDO) is a substantially industrial metabolite used in the polymer industry. Although several natural PDO production hosts exist, e.g. Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Clostridium sp., the PDO yield on glycerol is insufficient for an economically viable bio-process. Enhancing this yield via strain improvement can be achieved by disconnecting the production and growth pathways. In the case of PDO formation, this approach results in a microorganism metabolizing glycerol strictly for PDO production, while catabolizing a co-substrate for growth and maintenance. We applied this strategy to improve the PDO production with Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579. RESULTS: Genetic tools were developed and used to create Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 dhaD in which dhaD, encoding for glycerol dehydrogenase, was deleted. Since this strain was unable to grow on glycerol anaerobically, both pathways were disconnected. The knock-out strain was perturbed with 13 different co-substrates for growth and maintenance. Glucose was the most promising, although a competition between NADH-consuming enzymes and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase emerged. CONCLUSION: Due to the deletion of dhaD in Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579, the PDO production and growth pathway were split. As a consequence, the PDO yield on glycerol was improved 1,5 times, strengthening the idea that Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 could become an industrially interesting host for PDO production.
TI  - Genes Encoding Toxin of Clostridium difficile in Children with and without Diarrhea.
AB  - The presence of gene 16S rRNA and genes encoding toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB),  and binary toxin (cdtA/cdtB) of Clostridium difficile in stool samples from children with (110) and without (150) diarrhea was determined by using a TaqMan system. Fifty-seven (21.9%) out of 260 stool samples harbored the 16S rRNA gene. The genetic profile of tcdA+/tcdB- and cdtA+/cdtB+ was verified in one C. difficile-positive diarrhea sample and of tcdA+/tcdB+ in three C. difficile-positive nondiarrhea samples. The presence of tcdA+/tcdB+ in stools obtained from children without diarrhea, suggests that they were asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic strains.
TI  - Impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (UAnPBR).
AB  - This study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (UAnPBR). Two mesophilic UAPBRs (UAnPBR1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1). To overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the UAnPBR2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. The design modifications in UAnPBR2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose at an OLR of 25.7 g COD L(-1)d(-1). Although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 L H2 L(-1)d(-1) was achieved in the UAnPBR2 at an OLR of 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose. The microbiological analysis (PCR/DGGE) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Propionispira arboris.
TI  - Clostridium bornimense sp. nov., isolated from a mesophilic, two-phase, laboratory-scale biogas reactor.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, mesophilic, hydrogen-producing bacterium, designated strain M2/40(T), was isolated from a mesophilic, two-phase, laboratory-scale biogas reactor fed continuously with maize silage supplemented with 5% wheat straw. 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison revealed an affiliation to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto (cluster I of the clostridia), with Clostridium cellulovorans as the closest characterized species, showing 93.8% sequence similarity to the type strain. Cells of strain M2/40(T) were rods to elongated filamentous rods that showed variable Gram staining. Optimal growth occurred at 35 degrees C and at pH 7. Grown on glucose, the main fermentation products were H2, CO2, formate, lactate and propionate. The DNA G+C content was 29.6 mol%. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were C(16 : 0), summed feature 10 (C(18 : 1)omega11c/omega9t/omega6t and/or unknown ECL 17.834) and C(18 : 1)omega11c dimethylacetal. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic differences, strain M2/40(T) represents a novel species within the genus Clostridium, for which we propose the name Clostridium bornimense sp. nov. The type strain is M2/40(T) ( = DSM 25664(T) = CECT 8097(T)).
TI  - The influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  - Highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Survival of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Clostridium butyricum and C. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. In processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both Bacillus species throughout the storage period. The two species of Clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. The effect of milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. The growth of Bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of Clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.
TI  - Simultaneous fermentation of glucose and xylose to butanol by Clostridium sp. strain BOH3.
AB  - Cellulose and hemicellulose constitute the major components in sustainable feedstocks which could be used as substrates for biofuel generation. However, following hydrolysis to monomer sugars, the solventogenic Clostridium will preferentially consume glucose due to transcriptional repression of xylose utilization genes. This is one of the major barriers in optimizing lignocellulosic hydrolysates that produce butanol. Unlike studies on existing bacteria, this study demonstrates that newly reported Clostridium sp. strain BOH3 is capable of fermenting 60 g/liter of xylose to 14.9 g/liter butanol, which is similar to the 14.5 g/liter butanol produced from 60 g/liter of glucose. More importantly, strain BOH3 consumes glucose and xylose simultaneously, which is shown by its capability for generating 11.7 g/liter butanol from a horticultural waste cellulosic hydrolysate containing 39.8 g/liter glucose and 20.5 g/liter xylose, as well as producing 11.9 g/liter butanol from another horticultural waste hemicellulosic hydrolysate containing 58.3 g/liter xylose and 5.9 g/liter glucose. The high-xylose-utilization capability of strain BOH3 is attributed to its high xylose-isomerase (0.97 U/mg protein) and xylulokinase (1.16 U/mg protein) activities compared to the low-xylose-utilizing solventogenic strains, such as Clostridium sp. strain G117. Interestingly, strain BOH3 was also found to produce riboflavin at 110.5 mg/liter from xylose and 76.8 mg/liter from glucose during the fermentation process. In summary, Clostridium sp. strain BOH3 is an attractive candidate for application in efficiently converting lignocellulosic hydrolysates to biofuels and other value-added products, such as riboflavin.
TI  - Porcine group A rotaviruses with heterogeneous VP7 and VP4 genotype combinations  can be found together with enteric bacteria on Belgian swine farms.
AB  - Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are an important cause of diarrhea in young piglets, resulting in significant economic losses. However, the role of RVA in the etiology of piglet diarrhea on Belgian swine farms was previously unreported. In the present study, different techniques, including fast antigen detection tests, virus isolation, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR have been applied for detection of RVA in diarrheic (n=28) and asymptomatic (n=6) fecal samples collected on Belgian pig farms. RT-qPCR was shown to be most sensitive. Routine bacteriological analysis of the fecal samples showed that most diarrheic RVA positive samples were also co-infected with one or more bacterial species, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella sp. and/or Brachyspira sp. Further genetic characterization of the VP7 and VP4 genes of 26 RVA strains resulted in the detection of six different G-genotypes (G2, G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11), and five different P-genotypes (P[6], P[7], P[13], P[23], P[27]), in a total of 12 different G/P combinations. A large intra-genotypic diversity was also apparent. In conclusion, results of the present study help us better understand the role of RVA in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea, and provide better insights into the vast genetic diversity present among circulating porcine group A rotaviruses.
TI  - Mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., a halotolerant polysaccharide-degrading bacterium.
AB  - A novel strictly anaerobic, halotolerant, organotrophic bacterium, strain P3M-3(T), was isolated from a microbial mat formed under the flow of hot water emerging from a 2775 m-deep well in Tomsk region (western Siberia, Russia). Cells of strain P3M-3(T) were straight and curved rods, 0.2-0.4 microm in width and 1.5-20 microm in length. Strain P3M-3(T) grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7.0-7.5 and in a NaCl concentration of 15 g l(-1). Under optimum growth conditions, the doubling time was 1 h. The isolate was able to ferment a variety of mono-, di- and polysaccharides, including microcrystalline cellulose. Acetate, ethanol, H2 and CO2 were the main products of glucose fermentation. The DNA G+C content was 33.4 mol%. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain P3M-3(T) was a member of family Lachnospiraceae, whose representatives are also found in Clostridium cluster XIVa. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Clostridium jejuense HY-35-12(T), the closest relative, was 93.9%. A novel genus and species, Mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed based on phylogenetic analysis and physiological properties of the novel isolate. The type strain of the type species is P3M-3(T) ( = DSM 26468(T) = VKM B-2804(T)).
TI  - Comparative diversity analysis of gut microbiota in two different human flora-associated mouse strains.
AB  - The Kunming (KM) mouse is a closed colony mouse strain widely used in Chinese pharmacology, toxicology, and microbiology research laboratories. However, few studies have examined human flora-associated (HFA) microbial communities in KM mice. In this study, HFA models were built from germ-free KM and C57BL/6J mouse strains, and gut microbial diversity was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. We found that the two strains of HFA mice were significantly different based on the UPGMA dendrogram and the Richness index, but dice similarity coefficients of mouse replicates were not significantly different between HFA-KM and HFA-C57BL/6J. Most of the dominant phyla of human gut microflora could be transferred into the guts of the two mouse strains. However, the predominant genus that formed in HFA-KM was Clostridium sp. and that in HFA-C57BL/6J was Blautia sp. These results imply that genotypes difference between the two mice strains is a critical factor in shaping the intestinal microflora. However, genetic differences of individuals within KM mouse populations failed to lead to individual difference in microflora. Successful generation of HFA-KM mice will facilitate studies examining how diet affects gut microbial structure, and will enable comparative studies for uncovering genetic factors that shape gut microbial communities.
TI  - Sequential sludge digestion after diverse pre-treatment conditions: sludge removal, methane production and microbial community changes.
AB  - A lab-scale sequential sludge digestion process which consists of a mesophilic anaerobic digester (MAD) and a thermophilic aerobic digester (TAD) was developed. Thermal, thermal-alkaline and long-term alkaline pre-treatments were applied to the feed sludge to examine their effects on sludge removal and methane production. Especially after thermal-alkaline pre-treatment, high COD removal was maintained; methane production rate was also drastically increased by improving the hydrolysis step of sludge degradation. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis indicated that bacterial communities were represented by three phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria) and that Clostridium straminisolvens was the major bacterial species in MAD. Quantitative real-time PCR results indicated that Methanosaeta concilli was the major archaeal species in MAD, and that Ureibacillus sp. was the most abundant bacterial species in TAD.
TI  - 'Core species' in three sources of indoor air belonging to the human micro-environment to the exclusion of outdoor air.
AB  - Although we spend the majority of our lives indoors, the airborne microbial content of enclosed spaces still remains inadequately described. The objective of this study was to characterize the bacterial diversity of indoor air in three different enclosed spaces with three levels of occupancy, and, in particular, to highlight the 'core' species, the opportunistic pathogens and their origins. Our findings provide an overall description of bacterial diversity in these indoor environments. Data gathered from the three enclosed spaces revealed the presence of a common indoor signature (60% of total sequences in common). This work will provide a clearer understanding of the dominant groups of bacteria encountered in enclosed spaces: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Thus, certain evidence revealed a connection between 'core' species and the human micro-environment (20% of phylotypes and 12% of sequences of human origin). Overall PCA analysis showed that the indoor environment is influenced mainly by the microbial diversity from nose and skin. Among the 'core species' found during this study, a large number (72% of all pathogen-related sequences were concentrated in 'core species') of genera and species are known to be responsible for opportunistic or nosocomial diseases or to include human commensal bacteria such as Mycobacterium sp., Acinetobacter baumanii, Aerococcus viridians, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris or Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - [Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on enteric microecology in ulcerative  colitis rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on enteric microbial  populations in ulcerative colitis (UC) model rats, so as to study its mechanisms underlying improving UC. METHODS: Thirty-nine male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group (n = 13 in each group). The UC model was established by intragstric perfusion of 4% dextran sodiumaqueous solution (DSS), once daily for 7 days. EA (15-25 Hz, 0.1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Tianshu" (ST 25), "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Shangjuxu" (ST 37) for 10 min, once daily for 5 days. Disease Activity Index (DAI) including body weight and stool blood state was used to evaluate the animals' conditions. The rats' excrement was collected to detect the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the animals' DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were considerably down-regulated in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly lowered, and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were notably increased in the EA group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: EA can improve DAI and the abundance and diversity of enteric bacterial microbiota in UC rats, which may be related to its protective effect on enteric microecology in UC.
TI  - Genome tailoring powered production of isobutanol in continuous CO2/H2 blend fermentation using engineered acetogen biocatalyst.
AB  - The cell energy fraction that powered maintenance and expression of genes encoding pro-phage elements, pta-ack cluster, early sporulation, sugar ABC transporter periplasmic proteins, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and fructose-1,6-disphosphatase in acetogen Clostridium sp. MT871 was re-directed to power synthetic operon encoding isobutanol biosynthesis at the expense of these genes achieved via their elimination. Genome tailoring decreased cell duplication time by 7.0 +/- 0.1 min (p < 0.05) compared to the parental strain, with intact genome and cell duplication time of 68 +/- 1 min (p < 0.05). Clostridium sp. MT871 with tailored genome was UVC-mutated to withstand 6.1 % isobutanol in fermentation broth to prevent product inhibition in an engineered commercial biocatalyst producing 5 % (674.5 mM) isobutanol during two-step continuous fermentation of CO2/H2 gas blend. Biocatalyst Clostridium sp. MT871RG- 11IBR6 was engineered to express six copies of synthetic operon comprising optimized synthetic format dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate lyase, acetolactate synthase, acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase, 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate dehydratase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase, regaining cell duplication time of 68 +/- 1 min (p < 0.05) for the parental strain. This is the first report on isobutanol production by an engineered acetogen biocatalyst suitable for commercial manufacturing of this chemical/fuel using continuous fermentation of CO2/H2 blend thus contributing to the reversal of global warming.
TI  - Effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  - Licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional Chimese medicines. However, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, six strains, comprising Bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, Veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, Bacillus sp. 46 and Clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. A total of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin. On the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was less severely affected. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Clostridium sp. Strain Ade.TY, a New Biohydrogen- and Biochemical-Producing Bacterium Isolated from Landfill Leachate Sludge.
AB  - Clostridium sp. strain Ade.TY is potentially a new biohydrogen-producing species  isolated from landfill leachate sludge. Here we present the assembly and annotation of its genome, which may provide further insights into its gene interactions for efficient biohydrogen production.
TI  - Xylanase and cellulase systems of Clostridium sp.: an insight on molecular approaches for strain improvement.
AB  - Bioethanol and biobutanol hold great promise as alternative biofuels, especially  for transport sector, because they can be produced from lignocellulosic agro-industrial residues. From techno-economic point of view, the bioprocess for biofuels production should involve minimal processing steps. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), which combines various processing steps such as pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation in a single bioreactor, could be of great relevance for the production of bioethanol and biobutanol or solvents (acetone, butanol, ethanol), employing clostridia. For CBP, Clostridium holds best promise because it possesses multi-enzyme system involving cellulosome and xylanosome, which comprise several enzymes such as cellulases and xylanases. The aim of this article was to review the recent developments on enzyme systems of clostridia, especially xylanase and cellulase with an effort to analyse the information available on molecular approaches for the improvement of strains with ultimate aim to improve the efficiencies of hydrolysis and fermentation.
TI  - Identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16S rRNA gene libraries.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [POE]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [PTE]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [EE]). Several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. However, until now, the polybacterial communities of POE, PTE, and EE have not been precisely studied. Hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16S rRNA gene libraries. Of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-PCR-positive samples. The obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA) to identify unique clones. The multiple types of ARDRA patterns (P=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (P=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in POE, PTE, and EE. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in EE. Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus spp. (n=19), Streptococcus spp. (n=18), Staphylococcus spp. (n=6), Exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), Gemella spp. (n=2), Enterococcus spp. (n=2), a Lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a Clostridium sp. (n=1), and a Nocardia sp. (n=1), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia spp. (n=18), Pseudomonas spp. (n=10), Enterobacter spp. (n=8), Acinetobacter spp. (n=3), Pantoea spp. (n=3), a Haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a Massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. Interestingly, among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. Besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. Therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of POE, PTE, and EE infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.
TI  - Degradation of lignocelluloses in rice straw by BMC-9, a composite microbial system.
AB  - To evaluate the potential utility of pretreatment of raw biomass with a complex microbial system, we investigated the degradation of rice straw by BMC-9, a lignocellulose decomposition strain obtained from a biogas slurry compost environment. The degradation characteristics and corresponding changes in the bacterial community were assessed. The results showed that rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, with a peak total biomass bacterium concentration of 3.3 x 10(8) copies/ml on day 1. The pH of the fermentation broth declined initially and then increased, and the mass of rice straw decreased steadily. The highest concentrations of volatile fatty acid contents (0.291 mg/l lactic acid, 0.31 mg/l formic acid, 1.93 mg/l acetic acid, and 0.73 mg/l propionic acid) as well as the highest xylanse activity (1.79 U/ml) and carboxymethyl cellulase activity (0.37 U/ml) occurred on day 9. The greatest diversity among the microbial community also occurred on day 9, with the presence of bacteria belonging to Clostridium sp., Bacillus sp., and Geobacillus sp. Together, our results indicate that BMC-9 has a strong ability to rapidly degrade the lignocelluloses of rice straw under relatively inexpensive conditions, and the optimum fermentation time is 9 days.
TI  - Direct bioconversion of raw corn stalk to hydrogen by a new strain Clostridium sp. FS3.
AB  - A new strain FS3 which could achieve an efficient bioconversion of raw corn stalk to hydrogen had been isolated from anaerobic acclimated sludge, and identified as Clostridium butyricum on the basis of a series of physiological and biochemical experiments and 16S rDNA gene sequence. The strain could utilize various carbon sources to produce hydrogen. On the basis of single-factor experiments, the response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to optimize the media for hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen yield of 92.9ml/g was observed under the optimal conditions: 20g/l raw corn stalk, 1.76g/l NH4HCO3, 0.91g/l KH2PO4 and 10.4ml/l nutrient solution. This finding opens a new avenue for direct conversion of raw cellulosic biomass to bio-hydrogen.
TI  - Clostridium geopurificans strain MJ1 sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic bacterium that grows via fermentation and reduces the cyclic nitramine explosive hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX).
AB  - A fermentative, non-spore forming, motile, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain MJ1(T), was isolated from an RDX contaminated aquifer at a live-fire training site in Northwest NJ, United States. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA base composition, strain MJ1(T) was assigned to the Firmicutes. The DNA G+C content was 42.8 mol%. Fermentative growth was supported by glucose and citrate in a defined basal medium. The bacterium is a strict anaerobe that grows between at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 and 18 and 37 degrees C. The culture did not grow with hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) as the electron acceptor or mineralize RDX under these conditions. However, MJ1(T) transformed RDX into MNX, methylenedinitramine, formaldehyde, formate, ammonium, nitrous oxide, and nitrate. The nearest phylogenetic relative with a validly published name was Desulfotomaculum guttoideum (95 % similarity). However, MJ1(T) was also related to Clostridium celerecrescens DSM 5628 (95 %), Clostridium indolis DSM 755 (94 %), and Clostridium sphenoides DSM 632 (94 %). DNA:DNA hybridization with these strains was between 6.7 and 58.7 percent. The dominant cellular fatty acids (greater than 5 % of the total, which was 99.0 % recovery) were 16:0 fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) (32.12 %), 18:1cis 11 dimethyl acetal (DMA) (16.47 %), 16:1cis 9 DMA (10.28 %), 16:1cis 9 FAME (8.10 %), and 18:1cis 9 DMA (5.36 %). On the basis of morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic data, Clostridium geopurificans is proposed as a new species in genus Clostridium, with strain MJ1(T) as the type strain.
TI  - Non-contiguous finished genome sequence and description of Clostridium dakarense  sp. nov.
AB  - Clostridium dakarense strain FF1(T), is the type strain of Clostridium dakarense  sp. nov., a new species within the genus Clostridium. This strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from the fecal flora of a 4-month-old Senegalese child suffering from gastroenteritis. C. dakarense sp. nov. strain FF1(T) is an obligate anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 3,735,762 bp long genome (1 chromosome but no plasmid) exhibits a G+C content of 27.98% and contains 3,843 protein-coding and 73 RNA genes, including 8 rRNA genes.
TI  - Characterization of Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus Clostridium into the genera Romboutsia gen. nov., Intestinibacter gen. nov., Terrisporobacter gen. nov. and Asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  - A Gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated CRIBT, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. The major cellular fatty acids of strain CRIBT were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain C12-C19 fatty acids, with C16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the specific spray reagents used. The only quinone was MK-6. The predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. The peptidoglycan type of strain CRIBT was A1sigma lanthionine-direct. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CRIBT was 28.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CRIBT was most closely related to a number of species of the genus Clostridium, including Clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), Clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), Clostridium mayombei (96.2%), Clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and Clostridium irregulare (95.5%). All these species show very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. DNA-DNA hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic studies, a novel genus, Romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. The novel isolate CRIBT (=DSM 25109T=NIZO 4048T) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. It is proposed that C. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as Romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. Furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is proposed for C. bartlettii, as Intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. glycolicum, as Terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. mayombei, as Terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and C. irregulare, as Asaccharospora irregularis gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. In addition, an emendation of the species Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order Eubacteriales is provided.
TI  - Reducing cofactors contribute to the increase of butanol production by a wild-type Clostridium sp. strain BOH3.
AB  - Availability of reducing factors (e.g., NADH and NADPH) plays an important role in improving the efficacy of products conversion in cofactor-dependent production systems. In this study, nicotinic acid (NA), the precursor of NADH and NADPH, was supplemented to the growth medium of a wild-type Clostridium sp. strain BOH3. Results showed that the addition of precursor NA to the medium led to a significant increase in the levels of NADH and NADPH. Meanwhile, a maximal cell growth rate and butanol generation rate were reached by applying a two-stage pH-shift strategy, achieving 18.7g/L butanol with a yield of 24.6% and a productivity of 0.26g/Lh. The metabolic patterns were shifted towards more reduced metabolites as reflected by higher butanol-to-acetone ratio (11%) and butanol-to-acid ratio (292%). Redistributing metabolic flux to butanol via manipulations of reducing cofactor and pH shift could become an alternative tool to realize metabolic engineering goals.
TI  - Investigation of the mechanisms underlying the high acetylene-reducing activity exhibited by the soil bacterial community from BC2 horizon in the permafrost zone of the East Siberian larch forest bed.
AB  - AIMS: This study addressed a microbial composition of East Siberian larch forest  bed soil and focused on major nitrogen-fixing bacterial consortia showing the highest capacity to induce acetylene reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of a soil microbial consortium to effectively reduce acetylene was investigated using gellan gum medium. In parallel, each microbial component in the medium was analysed by a 16S rRNA gene-targeting denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), together with an attempt to isolate pure culture of the culturable eubacteria. Six strains of the isolated bacteria were characterized as diazotrophs, and Burkholderia xenovorans was found to be one of the major nitrogen fixer in the bacterial community cultured from the BC2 horizon soil microbiota. Co-culturing of either a diazotrophic Pseudomonas sp. with a nondiazotrophic Luteibacter sp. or a diazotrophic Luteibacter sp. with a nondiazotrophic bacterium B. xenovorans resulted in a marked elevation in acetylene reduction over that observed in the pure culture of each diazotroph. CONCLUSIONS: A promotion of acetylene reduction in mixed bacterial cultures, particularly when the cultures included Luteibacter, was clearly observed due to an increase in the bacterial cell population. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study, which showed that some unculturable bacteria including anaerobic Clostridium sp. that can provide major contribution to nitrogen fixation, may provide key information useful in identifying the 'missing link' in the nitrogen cycle in the cryogenic soil ecosystem of boreal forests.
TI  - A gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. Bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. As a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. RESULTS: In this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). We monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. All patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. Only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from Acidaminococcus sp., Eubacterium sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. Two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of Clostridium butyricum and C. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. Most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, our analysis refines but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.
TI  - Tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), perchloroethene (PCE), carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Clostridium sp. and Paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Desulfovibrio vulgaris). Effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (EC50) were determined. The octanol-water partition coefficient or log Po/w of a CAH proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. Most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar CAHs CF and 1,2-DCA, respectively, than the two relatively less polar compounds PCE and CT. EC50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher tolerance levels. Overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to CAHs than respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to CAHs. These data extend the current understanding of the impact of CAHs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.
TI  - Description of Anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium from Clostridium rRNA cluster III isolated from soil of a Japanese rice field, and reclassification of Bacteroides cellulosolvens Murray et al. 1984 as Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic bacterial strain designated T-1-35(T) was isolated as a dominant cultivable cellulose-degrading bacterium from soil of a Japanese rice field as an anaerobic filter-paper degrader. Cells of strain T-1-35(T) stained Gram-positive and were non-spore-forming rods with rounded ends, 0.8-1.0x3.5-15.0 microm, and motile by means of two to four polar flagella. Cells of strain T-1-35(T) exhibited pleomorphism: in aged cultures (over 90 days of incubation), almost all cells were irregularly shaped. Although no spore formation was observed, cells tolerated high temperatures, up to 90 degrees C for 10 min. The temperature range for growth was 15-40 degrees C, with an optimum at 35 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 5.5-9.0, with an optimum at pH 8.0-8.5 (slightly alkaliphilic). Strain T-1-35(T) fermented some carbohydrates to produce ethanol and lactate as the major products. Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and iso-C13 : 0 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain T-1-35(T) belonged to Clostridium rRNA cluster III. The closest relative of strain T-1-35(T) was Bacteroides cellulosolvens WM2(T), with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 93.4 %. Phenotypic, physiological and molecular genetic methods demonstrated that strain T-1-35(T) was distinct from its phylogenetic relatives (members of Clostridium rRNA cluster III) because it predominantly produced ethanol, iso-C13 : 0 3-OH was a major cellular fatty acid and it always exhibited pleomorphism. On the basis of the results of a polyphasic taxonomic study, strain T-1-35(T) is considered to represent a novel genus and species, Anaerobacterium chartisolvens gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerobacterium chartisolvens is T-1-35(T) ( = DSM 27016(T) = NBRC 109520(T)). In addition, from the results of our phylogenetic analysis and its phenotypic features, the species Bacteroides cellulosolvens Murray et al. 1984 is proposed to be reclassified in the new genus Pseudobacteroides as Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens gen. nov., comb. nov., with the type strain WM2(T) ( = ATCC 35603(T) = DSM 2933(T) = NRCC 2944(T)).
TI  - Potentialities of newly isolated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  - Two Bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16S rRNA sequence profile as Bacillus subtilis AKL1 and by biochemical process as Lactobacillus acidophilus AKL2. These isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. Different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (Mother Dairy and Thackar) curds. The total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of AKL1 and AKL2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). The antioxidant activity against ABTS+, DPPH8, OH* and Fe3+ were also higher in the newly formulated curd. Polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in AKL1+AKL2. All these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentery, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. It can be concluded that the combination of these Lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.
TI  - UVC-mutagenesis in acetogens: resistance to methanol, ethanol, acetone, or n-butanol in recombinants with tailored genomes as the step in engineering of commercial biocatalysts for continuous CO(2)/H(2) blend fermentations.
AB  - Time- and cost-efficient six-step UVC-mutagenesis was developed and validated to  generate acetogen mutants with preliminary reduced genomes to prevent product inhibition in the to-be-engineered commercial biocatalysts. Genome reduction was performed via elimination of pta, ack, spo0A, spo0J and some pro-phage genes. UVC-mutants such as Clostridium sp. MT1784RG, Clostridium sp. MT653RG, Clostridium sp. MT896RG, and Clostridium sp. MT1962RG (all 4 share 97 % DNA homology with Clostridium ljungdahlii ATCC 55383) were selected based on resistance to methanol (3 M), ethanol (3.6 M), acetone (2.5 M), or n-butanol (0.688 M), respectively. As a part of the biocatalyst engineering algorithm, genome reduction step was associated with integration of attTn7 recognition sequence to the chromosomes of each of the above strains to prepare the defined integration sites for future integration of multi-copy synthetic operons encoding biosynthesis of methanol, ethanol, acetone or n-butanol. Reduced genome mutants had cell duplication times decreased compared to the same for the respective parental strains. All groups of mutants had decreased share of palmitic (C16:0) and increased share of oleic (C18:1) acids along with detection of isopropylstearate (C20) compared to the parental strains. Mutants resistant to acetone and n-butanol also had monounsaturated fatty acid (C20:1) not found in parental strains. Cyclopropane fatty acid (C21) was identified only in n-butanol resistant mutants.
TI  - Oral administration of Lactobacillus fermentum I5007 favors intestinal development and alters the intestinal microbiota in formula-fed piglets.
AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of early administration of Lactobacillus fermentum I5007 on intestinal development and microbial composition in the gastrointestinal tract using a neonatal piglet model. Full-term 4 day old piglets, fed with milk replacer, were divided into a control group (given placebo of 0.1% peptone water) and a L. fermentum I5007 group (dosed daily with 6 x 10(9) CFU/mL L. fermentum I5007). The experiment lasted 14 days. On day 14, a significant increase in the jejunum villous height (583 +/- 33 vs 526 +/- 18) and increases in the concentrations of butyrate (7.55 +/- 0.55 vs 5.33 +/- 0.39) and branched chain fatty acids in the colonic digesta were observed in piglets in the L. fermentum I5007 treatment (P < 0.05). mRNA expression of IL-1beta (1.29 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.07) in the ileum were lower after 14 days of treatment with L. fermentum I5007. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that L. fermentum I5007 affected the colonic microbial communities on day 14 and, in particular, reduced numbers of Clostridium sp. L. fermentum I5007 play a positive role in gut development in neonatal piglets by modulating microbial composition, intestinal development, and immune status. L. fermentum I5007 may be useful as a probiotic for application in neonatal piglets.
TI  - Effects of meat pH on growth of 11 species of psychrotolerant clostridia on vacuum packaged beef and blown pack spoilage of the product.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the effects of meat pH on the abilities of  11 psychrotolerant Clostridium spp. to grow on, and to possibly cause blown pack spoilage of vacuum packaged beef. Beef steaks of pH 5.4-5.6, 5.7-5.9 or >/=6.0, i.e. of normal, intermediate or high pH were prepared and vacuum packaged. Groups of 3 steaks of the same pH range were inoculated with log phase cultures of Clostridium algoriphilum, Clostridium algidixylanolyticum, Clostridium bowmanii, Clostridium estertheticum, Clostridium frigoris, Clostridium frigidicarnis, Clostridium gasigenes, Clostridium lacusfryxellense, Clostridium psychrophilum, Clostridium tagluense or Clostridium vincentii. Each pack was resealed immediately after the steak was inoculated, and pack volumes were determined by water displacement, immediately after resealing and at intervals during storage at 2 degrees C for 56 days. All of the clostridia grew in packs of high pH beef but none caused pack swelling. Packs of intermediate pH beef inoculated with C. estertheticum began to swell after 14 days, with a mean rate of increase of pack volumes of 6.80 ml/day. One pack of intermediate pH beef inoculated with C. frigoris was swollen after 37 days. Packs of normal pH beef that had been inoculated with C. estertheticum began swelling after 14 days with a mean rate of increase of pack volumes of 7.70 ml/day. Packs of normal or intermediate pH beef inoculated with other clostridia did not swell. After storage, the numbers of most Clostridium spp., as determined by real-time PCR were greater on beef of high pH than of lower pH values, but the numbers of C. frigidicarnis and C. lacusfryxellense were highest on intermediate pH meat, the numbers of C. estertheticum were higher on meat of lower than of high pH, and the numbers of C. tagluense were the same on meat of all pH values. With high pH meat, glucose was reduced to very low level in rinse fluids from packs that had been inoculated with any Clostridium sp. With intermediate and normal pH meat, glucose was reduced to very low concentrations in only rinse fluids from beef that had been inoculated with C. estertheticum.
TI  - Non-contiguous finished genome sequence and description of Clostridium saudii sp. nov.
AB  - Clostridium saudii strain JCC(T) sp. nov. is the type strain of C. saudii sp. nov., a new species within the genus Clostridia. This strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from a fecal sample collected from an obese 24-year-old (body mass index 52 kg/m2) man living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. C. saudii is a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 3,653,762 bp long genome contains 3,452 protein-coding and 53 RNA genes, including 4 rRNA genes.
TI  - Dynamics of hydrogen-producing bacteria in a repeated batch fermentation process  using lake sediment as inoculum.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of lake sediment as inoculum for hydrogen production through dark fermentation in a repeated batch process. In addition, we investigated the effect of heat treatment, applied to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria, on the bacterial composition and metabolism. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and molecular cloning, both performed using the 16S rDNA gene as target gene, were used to monitor the structure of the bacterial community. Hydrogen production and bacterial metabolism were analysed via gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Both treated and non-treated inocula were able to produce high amounts of hydrogen. However, statistical analysis showed a clear difference in their bacterial composition and metabolism. The heat treatment favoured the growth of different Clostridia sp., in particular of Clostridium bifermentans, allowing the production of a constant amount of hydrogen over prolonged time. These cultures showed both butyrate and ethanol fermentation types. Absence of heat treatment allowed species belonging to the genera Bacillus, Sporolactobacillus and Massilia to outgrow Clostridia sp. with a reduction in hydrogen production and a significant metabolic change. Our data indicate that lake sediment harbours bacteria that can efficiently produce hydrogen over prolonged fermentation time. Moreover, we could show that the heat treatment stabilizes the bacterial community composition and the hydrogen production.
TI  - An analysis of risk factors of Clostridiumdifficile infection in patients hospitalized in the teaching hospital in 2008.
AB  - The last decade saw an increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infections.Approximately 80% of these infections occur in hospitalized patients. There are ongoing studies on the increase in the incidence of infections with this microorganism. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the risk factors of C. dicfficile infections in patients hospitalized in the teaching hospital in Warsaw in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted to achieve this objective. The study group comprised 266 patients. Patients in the study group were assessed for the following factors: sex; age; place of residence; hospitalizations; the use of proton pump inhibitors (IPP), various antibiotics, probiotics; hospital stay conditions, and the patient's condition. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that out of the assessed risk factors, hospitalization within the 3 months preceding hospital admission (OR 5.02; P<0.003) and antibiotic therapy (OR 4.85; P<0.003) were associated with the highest risk of C. difficile infection. Hospital stay conditions, including a stay in a multi-bed room (OR 1.64; P=0.05) or in a room without an en suite toilet (OR 1.59; P=0.01), were also shown to play a role. The risk of a C. difficile infection was also increased in the case of "bed-ridden" patients requiring the assistance of hospital staff for their daily hygiene (OR 1.69; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hospitalization itself, including the frequency and conditions of hospital stay, as well as receiving antibiotic therapy were significant risk factors of C. difficile infections in patients hospitalized at the SP CSK. Therefore, our analysis showed that C. difficile infections are mostly nosocomial.
TI  - Isolation of a solventogenic Clostridium sp. strain: fermentation of glycerol to  n-butanol, analysis of the bcs operon region and its potential regulatory elements.
AB  - A new solventogenic bacterium, strain GT6, was isolated from standing water sediment. 16S-rRNA gene analysis revealed that GT6 belongs to the heterogeneous Clostridium tetanomorphum group of bacteria exhibiting 99% sequence identity with C. tetanomorphum 4474(T). GT6 can utilize a wide range of carbohydrate substrates including glucose, fructose, maltose, xylose and glycerol to produce mainly n-butanol without any acetone. Additional products of GT6 metabolism were ethanol, butyric acid, acetic acid, and trace amounts of 1,3-propanediol. Medium and substrate composition, and culture conditions such as pH and temperature influenced product formation. The major fermentation product from glycerol was n-butanol with a final concentration of up to 11.5 g/L. 3% (v/v) glycerol lead to a total solvent concentration of 14 g/L within 72 h. Growth was not inhibited by glycerol concentrations as high as 15% (v/v). The solventogenesis genes crt, bcd, etfA/B and hbd composing the bcs (butyryl-CoA synthesis) operon of C. tetanomorphum GT6 were sequenced. They occur in a genomic arrangement identical to those in other solventogenic clostridia. Furthermore, the sequence of a potential regulator gene highly similar to that of the NADH-sensing Rex family of regulatory genes was found upstream of the bcs operon. Potential binding sites for Rex have been identified in the promoter region of the bcs operon of solvent producing clostridia as well as upstream of other genes involved in NADH oxidation. This indicates a fundamental role of Rex in the regulation of fermentation products in anaerobic, and especially in solventogenic bacteria.
TI  - Structure of Acidothermus cellulolyticus family 74 glycoside hydrolase at 1.82 A  resolution.
AB  - Here, a 1.82 A resolution X-ray structure of a glycoside hydrolase family 74 (GH74) enzyme from Acidothermus cellulolyticus is reported. The resulting structure was refined to an R factor of 0.150 and an Rfree of 0.196. Structural analysis shows that five related structures have been reported with a secondary-structure similarity of between 75 and 89%. The five similar structures were all either Clostridium thermocellum or Geotrichum sp. M128 GH74 xyloglucanases. Structural analysis indicates that the A. cellulolyticus GH74 enzyme is an endoxyloglucanase, as it lacks a characteristic loop that blocks one end of the active site in exoxyloglucanases. Superimposition with the C. thermocellum GH74 shows that Asp451 and Asp38 are the catalytic residues.
TI  - Toxicity of ionic liquids to Clostridium sp. and effects on uranium biosorption.
AB  - As green solvents ionic liquids (ILs) show high potential in nuclear industry for extraction and purification of actinides. However, to date relatively little information has been gained on ILs application in microbial processes, for example biosorption of radionuclides. We investigated the effects of three ILs, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIMPF6), N-ethylpyridinium trifluoroacetate (EtPyCF3COO) and N-ethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate (EtPyBF4) on the growth and biosorption of uranium by Clostridium sp. The ILs affected the growth of the bacterium as evidenced by decreases in optical density, total gas production, and organic acids production from glucose metabolism. The IC50-48h of three ILs decreased in the order of BMIMPF6 (8.26mM)>EtPyBF4 (7.04mM)>EtPyCF3COO (4.05mM). Uranium biosorption by the bacterial cells decreased by 75% in the presence of 1% (v/v) BMIMPF6 and by about 90% with 1% (v/v) EtPyBF4 or EtPyCF3COO, in comparison to the control without ILs. The diminished biosorption may be attributed to the membrane damages induced by EtPyBF4 and EtPyCF3COO, which can be visualized by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis revealed the accumulation of uranium inside peripheral membrane of the cells exposed to uranium alone or with BMIMPF6, while little or no accumulation was observed in the presence of EtPyBF4 and EtPyCF3COO. These results imply that potential toxicity of ILs towards microorganisms is a particularly important issue in limiting its biotechnological applications.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Influence of N- and/or C-terminal regions on activity, expression, characteristics and structure of lipase from Geobacillus sp. 95.
AB  - GD-95 lipase from Geobacillus sp. strain 95 and its modified variants lacking N-terminal signal peptide and/or 10 or 20 C-terminal amino acids were successfully cloned, expressed and purified. To our knowledge, GD-95 lipase precursor (Pre-GD-95) is the first Geobacillus lipase possessing more than 80% lipolytic activity at 5 degrees C. It has maximum activity at 55 degrees C and displays a broad pH activity range. GD-95 lipase was shown to hydrolyze p-NP dodecanoate, tricaprylin and canola oil better than other analyzed substrates. Structural and sequence alignments of bacterial lipases and GD-95 lipase revealed that the C-terminus forms an alpha helix, which is a conserved structure in lipases from Pseudomonas, Clostridium or Staphylococcus bacteria. This work demonstrates that 10 and 20 C-terminal amino acids of GD-95 lipase significantly affect stability and other physicochemical properties of this enzyme, which has never been reported before and can help create lipases with more specific properties for industrial application. GD-95 lipase and its modified variants GD-95-10 can be successfully applied to biofuel production, in leather and pulp industries, for the production of cosmetics or perfumes. These lipases are potential biocatalysts in processes, which require extreme conditions: low or high temperature, strongly acidic or alkaline environment and various organic solvents.
TI  - Eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human blood.
AB  - A catalase-positive, rod-shaped, non-proteolytic, non-motile, anaerobic bacterial strain, designated B086562(T), was isolated from a blood culture of an 84-year-old male patient in Israel. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, this strain has no known close relatives among recognized bacteria but should be placed within the family Lachnospiraceae. The most closely related recognized bacteria were from the 'Clostridium clostridioforme group': C. clostridioforme (92.4%) and Clostridium bolteae (92.3%). The isolate produced butyrate, lactate, acetate and succinate as major metabolic end products. The major fatty acids were C16:0 and C18:1 cis 9 DMA and the DNA G+C content was 46.0 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, the blood isolate represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Eisenbergiella tayi is B086562(T) ( = LMG 27400(T) = DSM 26961(T) = ATCC BAA-2558(T)).
TI  - Time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. We investigated Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time using quantitative real-time PCR. Bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change significantly up to 5 days post mortem. In cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of Bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). Our results showed that ratios of Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.
TI  - New hybrid materials based on poly(ethyleneoxide)-grafted polysilazane by hydrosilylation and their anti-fouling activities.
AB  - The objective of this work was to develop new coating materials based on poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO), which was grafted onto polysilazane (PSZ) by hydrosilylation. Three types of PEO with different molecular weights (350, 750, 2000 g/mol) were studied. The kinetics and yields of this reaction have been surveyed by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The PEO grafting-density onto PSZ by hydrosilylation increases with a reduction of the S-H/allyl ratio and a decrease of the PEO chain-length. The PEO-graft-PSZ (PSZ-PEO) hybrid coatings, which can be used to prevent the adhesion of marine bacteria on surfaces, were applied by moisture curing at room temperature. The anti-adhesion performance, and thus the anti-fouling activity, of the coatings against three marine bacteria species, Clostridium sp. SR1, Neisseria sp. LC1 and Neisseria sp. SC1, was examined. The anti-fouling activity of the coatings depends on the grafting density and the chain length of PEO. The shortest PEO(350 g/mol)-graft-PSZ with the highest graft density was found to have the best anti-fouling activity. As the density of grafted PEO(750 g/mol) and PEO(2000 g/mol) chains onto the PSZ surface is approximately equal, the relative effectiveness of these two types of PEO is controlled by the length of the PEO chain. The PEO(2000 g/mol)-graft-PSZ coatings are more efficient than the PEO(750 g/mol)-graft-PSZ coatings for the bacterial anti-adhesion.
TI  - Production of H(2) from cellulose by rumen microorganisms: effects of inocula pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis.
AB  - H2 production from cellulose, using rumen fluid as the inoculum, has been investigated in batch experiments. Methanogenic archaea were inhibited by acid pre-treatment, which also inhibited cellulolytic microorganisms, and in consequence, the conversion of cellulose to H2. Positive results were observed only with the addition of cellulase. H2 yields were 18.5 and 9.6 mmol H2 g cellulose(-1) for reactors with 2 and 4 g cellulose l(-1) and cellulase, respectively. H2 was primarily generated by the butyric acid pathway and this was followed by formation of acetic acid, ethanol and n-butanol. In reactors using 4 g cellulose l(-1) and cellulase, the accumulation of alcohols negatively affected the H2 yield, which changed the fermentation pathways to solventogenesis. PCR-DGGE analysis showed changes in the microbial communities. The phylogenetic affiliations of the bands of DGGE were 99 % similar to Clostridium sp.
TI  - Hungatella effluvii gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic bacterium isolated from an effluent treatment plant, and reclassification of Clostridium hathewayi as Hungatella hathewayi gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  - A Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming and strictly anaerobic bacterium, designated UB-B.2(T), was isolated from an industrial effluent anaerobic digester sample. It grew optimally at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence confirmed that strain UB-B.2(T) was closely related to Clostridium hathewayi DSM 13479(T) (97.84% similarity), a member of rRNA gene cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium, and formed a coherent cluster with other related members of the Blautia (Clostridium) coccoides rRNA group in phylogenetic analyses. The end products of glucose fermentation by strain UB-B.2(T) were acetate and propionate. The G+C content of the DNA was 51.4 mol%. Although strain UB-B.2(T) showed 97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to the type strain of C. hathewayi, it exhibited only 38.4% relatedness at the whole-genome level. It also showed differences from its closest phylogenetic relative, C. hathewayi DSM 13479(T), in phenotypic characteristics such as hydrolysis of aesculin, starch and urea and fermentation end products. Both strains showed phenotypic differences from the members of rRNA gene cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium. Based on these differences, C. hathewayi DSM 13479(T) and strain UB-B.2(T) were identified as representatives of a new genus of the family Clostridiaceae. Thus, we propose the reclassification of Clostridium hathewayi as Hungatella hathewayi gen. nov., comb. nov., the type species of the new genus (type strain DSM 13479(T) = CCUG 43506(T) = MTCC 10951(T)). Strain UB-B.2(T) ( = MTCC 11101(T) = DSM 24995(T)) is assigned to the novel species Hungatella effluvii gen. nov., sp. nov as the type strain.
TI  - [The use of molecular methods in the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infections].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to use molecular methods to identify selected strains of C. difficile isolated from patients hospitalized at Independent Public Central Teaching Hospital [SP CSK] between 2008 and 2011 in order to demonstrate their toxicgenic character and to determine their epidemic potential, including the incidence of a suspected C. difficile strain 027/NAP1/B1. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Originally evaluated material consisted of freshly collected stool samples from patients who had developed diarrhea. Stool samples were assessed for toxins A and B via an immunoenzymatic method and for the presence of C. difficile via the first culture method. The isolated strains were stored on MICROBANK mediums, at -70 degrees C. From this sample collection, 48 strains isolated in 2008 and 28 strains isolated in 2011 were selected for molecular analysis. RESULTS: Among the C. difficile isolates that underwent molecular analysis there were 6 strains 027/NAP1/BI out of the 48 evaluated strains isolated in 2008, which constituted 12.5% and 24 strains 027/NAP1/BI out of the 28 strains isolated in 2011, which constituted 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of a possible hyperepidemic strain of C. difficile is crucial for undertaking any anti-epidemic activities in health care facilities, where such activities are more and more common and are responsible for nosocomial foci of infection.
TI  - Added value of multiplex Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG(R) GPP) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  - The Luminex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (xTAG((R)) GPP) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (NG) I/II, rotavirus A, Clostridium difficile toxin A/B, Campylobacter sp., Escherichia coli O157, Enterotoxigenic E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, Salmonella sp., Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Shiga-like toxin (Stx)1/2, Shigella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia sp. In this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during November and December 2011 at our laboratory, using the xTAG((R)) GPP assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. This procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. If the clinician did not request the test for an xTAG((R)) GPP-positive target, real-time PCR assays were used to confirm xTAG((R)) GPP positivity. Discrepant results were also tested with real-time PCR assays. A total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xTAG((R)) GPP. The xTAG((R)) GPP assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11 targets could not be confirmed by real-time PCR. The non-confirmed targets were Campylobacter (one sample), Salmonella (four samples), Shigella (one sample) and E. histolytica (five samples). The xTAG((R)) GPP was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single molecular test, but for detection of E. histolytica and Salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.
TI  - Enhanced start-up of anaerobic facultatively autotrophic biocathodes in bioelectrochemical systems.
AB  - Biocathodes in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can be used to convert CO2 into  diverse organic compounds through a process called microbial electrosynthesis. Unfortunately, start-up of anaerobic biocathodes in BESs is a difficult and time consuming process. Here, a pre-enrichment method was developed to improve start-up of anaerobic facultatively autotrophic biocathodes capable of using cathodes as the electron donor (electrotrophs) and CO2 as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic enrichment of bacteria from freshwater bog sediment samples was first performed in batch cultures fed with glucose and then used to inoculate BES cathode chambers set at -0.4V (versus a standard hydrogen electrode; SHE). After two weeks of heterotrophic operation of BESs, CO2 was provided as the sole electron acceptor and carbon source. Consumption of electrons from cathodes increased gradually and was sustained for about two months in concert with a significant decrease in cathode chamber headspace CO2. The maximum current density consumed was -34 +/- 4 mA/m(2). Biosynthesis resulted in organic compounds that included butanol, ethanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and hydrogen gas. Bacterial community analyses based on 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed Trichococcus palustris DSM 9172 (99% sequence identity) as the prevailing species in biocathode communities, followed by Oscillibacter sp. and Clostridium sp. Isolates from autotrophic cultivation were most closely related to Clostridium propionicum (99% sequence identity; ZZ16), Clostridium celerecrescens (98-99%; ZZ22, ZZ23), Desulfotomaculum sp. (97%; ZZ21), and Tissierella sp. (98%; ZZ25). This pre-enrichment procedure enables simplified start-up of anaerobic biocathodes for applications such as electrofuel production by facultatively autotrophic electrotrophs.
TI  - Dynamic changes in the composite microbial system MC1 during and following its rapid degradation of lignocellulose.
AB  - To monitor the dynamics of the composite microbial system MC1 during its degradation of lignocellulose and to improve our understanding of the microbial communities involved in this biomass conversion, MC1 was characterized at eight time points over an 18-day, thermophilic, aerobic, static cultivation. We found the microbial communities to be dynamic, rhythmic consortia capable of changing in response to lignocellulose degradation. The growth curve over 18 days was M-shaped. Based on the quantitative changes in five major components of MC1 (Clostridium straminisolvens CSK-1, Clostridium sp. FG4, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. M1-5, and Bordetella sp. M1-6), reduction in rice straw weight, cellulase (CMCase) activity, xylanase activity, and changes in medium pH, we found that the process comprised two identifiable phases. Rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, while the post-rapid degradation phase included days 10 to 18. Day 3 and day 12 were two key time points in the rapid degradation phase and post-rapid degradation phase, respectively. Two anaerobes, C. straminisolvens CSK-1 and Clostridium sp. FG4, dominated the MC1 system from day 0 to day 18.
TI  - Microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  - Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut)).
TI  - Enrichment of a microbial consortium capable of reductive deiodination of 2,4,6-triiodophenol.
AB  - An anaerobic microbial consortium capable of reductively dehalogenating 2,4,6-triiodophenol (2,4,6-TIP) to 4-iodophenol was enriched from sediments collected from an iodine-producing industry, Chiba, Japan. In the presence of lactate, the enrichment reductively deiodinated 2,4,6-TIP, 2,4-diiodophenol and 2-iodophenol, suggesting preferential removal of ortho-substituted iodines. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that at least 4 bacteria, including Pseudomonas stutzeri, Clostridium sp., Sedimentibacter sp., and unidentified Chloroflexi bacterium, were predominant in the enrichment. Interestingly, the DGGE band corresponding to the Chloroflexi bacterium disappeared when the enrichment was grown in the absence of 2,4,6-triiodophenol. In addition, the DGGE band with a nearly identical gene sequence was detected in another enrichment that consumed 3-amino-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid (ATBA). Phylogenetic analysis of 1416 bp of 16S rRNA gene sequence for this putative deiodinating bacterium revealed that it was closely related (93% sequence similarity) with an anaerobic bacterium MO-CFX2 belonging to the class Anaerolineae, which was recently isolated from subseafloor sediments. The sequence similarities with other known reductive dehalogenating bacteria such as Dehalococcoides mccartyi and Dehalobium chlorocoercia were relatively low (78%-80%). Quantitative PCR analysis targeting specific 16S rRNA gene region of the putative deiodinating bacterium showed that the enrichments consuming 2,4,6-TIP or ATBA contained 18 to 1070 times much higher amounts of 16S rRNA gene copies than those in the enrichments that do not consume these iodoaromatic compounds. These results suggest that a novel anaerobic bacterium in the class Anaerolineae is capable of reductively deiodinating 2,4,6-iodobenzene derivatives.
TI  - [Key enzymes in butanol fermentation by a facultative anaerobe Bacillus sp. TSH1].
AB  - Bacillus sp. TSH1 is a butanol-producing microorganism newly isolated in our laboratory; it can grow and ferment under facultative anaerobic conditions, while sharing similar fermentation pathways and products with Clostridium acetobutylicum. To illustrate the relationships between the products and the enzyme activities in Bacillus sp. TSH1, key butanol- and ethanol-forming enzymes were studied, including butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, butanol dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. The activities of the three enzymes increased rapidly after the initiation of fermentation. Activities of three enzymes peaked before 21 h, and simultaneously, product concentrations also began to increase gradually. The maximum activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was 0.054 U/mg at 12 h, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase 0.035 U/mg at 21 h and butanol dehydrogenase 0.055 U/mg at 15 h. The enzyme activities then decreased, but remained constant at a low level after 24 h, while the concentrations of butanol, acetone, and ethanol continued increasing until the end of the fermentation. The results will attribute to the understanding of the butanol metabolic mechanism, and provide a reference for further study of a facultative Bacillus metabolic pathway.
TI  - Successful treatment of simulated Clostridium difficile infection in a human gut  model by fidaxomicin first line and after vancomycin or metronidazole failure.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fidaxomicin reduces the risk of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) compared with vancomycin. We investigated fidaxomicin primary or secondary treatment efficacy using a gut model. METHODS: Four triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with faeces. After clindamycin induction of CDI, fidaxomicin (200 mg/L twice daily), vancomycin (125 mg/L four times daily) or metronidazole (9.3 mg/L three times daily) was administered for 7 days. Following failure/CDI recurrence, fidaxomicin (200 mg/L twice daily, 7 days) was instilled. C. difficile (CD) total viable counts (TVC), spore counts (SP), toxin titres (CYT), gut bacteria counts and antimicrobial concentrations were measured throughout. RESULTS: Fidaxomicin instillation reduced CD TVC/SP and CYT below the limit of detection (LOD) after 2 and 4 days, respectively, with no CDI recurrence. Metronidazole instillation failed to decrease CD TVC or CYT. Vancomycin instillation reduced CD TVC and CYT to LOD by day 4, but SP persisted. Recurrence occurred 13 days after vancomycin instillation; subsequent fidaxomicin instillation reduced CD TVC/SP/CYT below the LOD from day 2. CD was isolated sporadically, with no evidence of spore recrudescence or toxin production. Fidaxomicin had a minimal effect on the microflora, except for bifidobacteria. Fidaxomicin was detected for at least 21 days post-instillation, whereas other antimicrobials were undetectable beyond approximately 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: Fidaxomicin successfully treated simulated primary and recurrent CDI. Fidaxomicin was superior to metronidazole in reducing CD TVC and SP, and superior to vancomycin in reducing SP without recurrence of vegetative cell growth. Fidaxomicin, but not vancomycin or metronidazole, persisted in the gut model for >20 days after instillation.
TI  - Unraveling the dha cluster in Citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  - In natural 1,3-propanediol (PDO) producing microorganisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Clostridium sp., the genes coding for PDO producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. This article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for PDO production, Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known PDO clusters of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae. Moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated ORFs, OrfW and OrfY, both in C. freundii and in C. werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(I)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme B12. Unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of C. werkmanii DSM17579 and those of C. freundii DSM30040 and K. pneumoniae MGH78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. On the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. For example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) is present in the dha cluster of C. werkmanii DSM17579, while two DHAK enzymes are present in the cluster of K. pneumoniae MGH78578 and Clostridium butyricum VPI1718.
TI  - Enhancing the cellulose-degrading activity of cellulolytic bacteria CTL-6 (Clostridium thermocellum) by co-culture with non-cellulolytic bacteria W2-10 (Geobacillus sp.).
AB  - The effect of a non-cellulolytic bacterium W2-10 (Geobacillus sp.) on the cellulose-degrading activity of a cellulolytic bacterium CTL-6 (Clostridium thermocellum) was determined using cellulose materials (paper and straw) in peptone cellulose solution (PCS) medium under aerobic conditions. The results indicated that in the co-culture, addition of W2-10 resulted in a balanced medium pH, and may provide the required anaerobic environment for CTL-6. Overall, addition of W2-10 was beneficial to CTL-6 growth in the adverse environment of the PCS medium. In co-culture with W2-10, the CTL-6 cellulose degradation efficiency of filter paper and alkaline-treated wheat straw significantly increased up to 72.45 and 37.79 %, respectively. The CMCase activity and biomass of CTL-6 also increased from 0.23 U ml(-1) and 45.1 mug ml(-1) (DNA content) up to 0.47 U ml(-1) and 112.2 mug ml(-1), respectively. In addition, co-culture resulted in accumulation of acetate and propionate up to 4.26 and 2.76 mg ml(-1). This was a respective increase of 2.58 and 4.45 times, in comparison to the monoculture with CTL-6.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Ralstonia eutropha for the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid-containing polyhydroxyalkanoates.
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are bio-based and biodegradable polyesters synthesized by numerous microorganisms. PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomer units have attracted much attention, but their production has not been efficient. Here, we metabolically engineered Ralstonia eutropha strains for the in vivo synthesis of PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomers. This was accomplished by replacing the R. eutropha phaC gene in the chromosome with either the R. eutropha phaC S506G A510K gene, which contains two point mutations, or the Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 phaC1437 gene. In addition, the R. eutropha phaAB genes in the chromosome were replaced with the Clostridium propionicum pct540 gene. All of the engineered R. eutropha strains produced PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacid monomers, including lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB), along with 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and/or 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV), when they were cultured in nitrogen-free medium containing 5 g/L lactate or 4 g/L 2HB and 20 g/L glucose as carbon sources. Expression of the Escherichia coli ldhA gene in engineered R. eutropha strains allowed production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] from glucose as the sole carbon source. This is the first report on the production of 2-hydroxyacid-containing PHAs by metabolically engineered R. eutropha.
TI  - Are cellulosome scaffolding protein CipC and CBM3-containing protein HycP, involved in adherence of Clostridium cellulolyticum to cellulose?
AB  - Clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic anaerobic bacterium, produces highly active enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes. This strain was already shown to bind to cellulose, however the molecular mechanism(s) involved is not known. In this context we focused on the gene named hycP, encoding a 250-kDa protein of unknown function, containing a Family-3 Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM3) along with 23 hyaline repeat modules (HYR modules). In the microbial kingdom the gene hycP is only found in C. cellulolyticum and the very close strain recently sequenced Clostridium sp BNL1100. Its presence in C. cellulolyticum guided us to analyze its function and its putative role in adhesion of the cells to cellulose. The CBM3 of HycP was shown to bind to crystalline cellulose and was assigned to the CBM3b subfamily. No hydrolytic activity on cellulose was found with a mini-protein displaying representative domains of HycP. A C. cellulolyticum inactivated hycP mutant strain was constructed, and we found that HycP is neither involved in binding of the cells to cellulose nor that the protein has an obvious role in cell growth on cellulose. We also characterized the role of the cellulosome scaffolding protein CipC in adhesion of C. cellulolyticum to cellulose, since cellulosome scaffolding protein has been proposed to mediate binding of other cellulolytic bacteria to cellulose. A second mutant was constructed, where cipC was inactivated. We unexpectedly found that CipC is only partly involved in binding of C. cellulolyticum to cellulose. Other mechanisms for cellulose adhesion may therefore exist in C. cellulolyticum. In addition, no cellulosomal protuberances were observed at the cellular surface of C. cellulolyticum, what is in contrast to reports from several other cellulosomes producing strains. These findings may suggest that C. cellulolyticum has no dedicated molecular mechanism to aggregate the cellulosomes at the cellular surface.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Clostridium sp. Strain DL-VIII, a Novel Solventogenic Clostridium Species Isolated from Anaerobic Sludge.
AB  - We report the genome sequence of Clostridium sp. strain DL-VIII, a novel Gram-positive, endospore-forming, solventogenic bacterium isolated from activated anaerobic sludge of a wastewater treatment plant. Aside from a complete sol operon, the 6,477,357-bp genome of DL-VIII reveals genes for several unique enzymes with applications in lignocellulose degradation, including two phenolic acid decarboxylases.
TI  - Agricultural soil and drilosphere as reservoirs of new and unusual assimilators of 2,4-dichlorophenol carbon.
AB  - 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) is a potential soil and groundwater contaminant. Earthworms modulate growth and activities of soil microbiota. Thus, active 2,4-DCP degraders in agricultural soil and drilosphere (i.e. burrow walls, gut content and cast) were identified by comparative amplicon pyrosequencing-based 16S rRNA stable isotope probing in soil columns. In situ relevant concentrations of [U-(13) C]2,4-DCP were consumed in soil within 19 and 41 days in the presence and absence of the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa, respectively. [U-(14) C]2,4-DCP mineralization was higher in cast, burrow wall and soil from columns with than without earthworms. [U-(14) C]2,4-DCP mineralization was lowest in gut contents. Data indicated a strong impact of earthworms on the active microbial community. Novosphingobium, Comamonas and Desulfitobacterium sp. assimilated 2,4-DCP-[(13)C] in the absence of earthworms. Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Clostridium sp. assimilated 2,4-DCP-[(13)C] in the drilosphere. Novosphingobium- and Variovorax-related taxa dominated [U-(13)C]2,4-DCP consumers in soil slurries with drilosphere and bulk soil material. 16S rRNA sequences suggested species level novelty. The collective data demonstrates that new Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria/Betaproteobacteria were involved in 2,4-DCP-C transformation and indicated that diverse and hitherto unknown microbes associated with carbon flow from 2,4-DCP are shaped by earthworms.
TI  - The effect of heavy metals on microbial community structure of a sulfidogenic consortium in anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors.
AB  - The effect of heavy metals on community structure of a heavy metal tolerant sulfidogenic consortium was evaluated by using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrB) gene fragments, 16S rRNA gene cloning analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For this purpose, four anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (referred as R1-R4) were run in parallel for 12 weeks at heavy metal loading rates of 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 7.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) each of Cu(2+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Cr(6+), respectively. The abundance ratio of Desulfovibrio vulgaris detected by FISH to total cell counts was consistent with the obtained results of cloning and DGGE. This indicated that D. vulgaris was dominant in all analyzed samples and played a key role in heavy metal removal in R1, R2, and R3. In contrast, after 4 weeks of operation of R4, a distinct biomass loss was observed and no positive hybridized cells were detected by specific probes for the domain Bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and D. vulgris. High removal efficiencies of heavy metals were achieved in R1, R2 and R3 after 12 weeks, whereas the precipitation of heavy metals in R4 was significantly decreased after 4 weeks and almost not observed after 6 weeks of operation. In addition, the anaerobic bacteria, such as Pertrimonas sulfuriphila, Clostridium sp., Citrobacter amalonaticus, and Klebsiella sp., identified from DGGE bands and clone library were hypothesized as heavy metal resistant bacteria at a loading rate of 1.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) of Cu(2+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Cr(6+.)
TI  - Influence of thermophilic aerobic digestion as a sludge pre-treatment and solids  retention time of mesophilic anaerobic digestion on the methane production, sludge digestion and microbial communities in a sequential digestion process.
AB  - In this study, the changes in sludge reduction, methane production and microbial  community structures in a process involving two-stage thermophilic aerobic digestion (TAD) and mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) under different solid retention times (SRTs) between 10 and 40 days were investigated. The TAD reactor (RTAD) was operated with a 1-day SRT and the MAD reactor (RMAD) was operated at three different SRTs: 39, 19 and 9 days. For a comparison, control MAD (RCONTROL) was operated at three different SRTs of 40, 20 and 10 days. Our results reveal that the sequential TAD-MAD process has about 42% higher methane production rate (MPR) and 15% higher TCOD removal than those of RCONTROL when the SRT decreased from 40 to 20 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR results indicate that RMAD maintained a more diverse bacteria and archaea population compared to RCONTROL, due to the application of the biological TAD pre-treatment process. In RTAD, Ureibacillus thermophiles and Bacterium thermus were the major contributors to the increase in soluble organic matter. In contrast, Methanosaeta concilii, a strictly aceticlastic methanogen, showed the highest population during the operation of overall SRTs in RMAD. Interestingly, as the SRT decreased to 20 days, syntrophic VFA oxidizing bacteria, Clostridium ultunense sp., and a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanobacterium beijingense were detected in RMAD and RCONTROL. Meanwhile, the proportion of archaea to total microbe in RMAD and RCONTROL shows highest values of 10.5 and 6.5% at 20-d SRT operation, respectively. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the increased COD removal and methane production at different SRTs in RMAD might be attributed to the increased synergism among microbial species by improving the hydrolysis of the rate limiting step in sludge with the help of the biological TAD pre-treatment.
TI  - In situ extractive fermentation for the production of hexanoic acid from galactitol by Clostridium sp. BS-1.
AB  - Clostridium sp. BS-1 produces hexanoic acid as a metabolite using galactitol and  enhanced hexanoic acid production was obtained by in situ extractive fermentation with Clostridium sp. BS-1 under an optimized medium composition. For medium optimization, five ingredients were selected as variables, and among them yeast extract, tryptone, and sodium butyrate were selected as significant variables according to a fractional factorial experimental design, a steepest ascent experimental design, and a Box-Behnken experimental design. The optimized medium had the following compositions in modified Clostridium acetobutyricum (mCAB) medium: 15.5gL(-1) of yeast extract, 10.13gL(-1) of tryptone, 0.04gL(-1) of FeSO4.7H2O, 0.85gL(-1) of sodium acetate, and 6.47gL(-1) of sodium butyrate. The predicted concentration of hexanoic acid with the optimized medium was 6.98gL(-1), and this was validated experimentally by producing 6.96gL(-1) of hexanoic acid with Clostridium sp. BS-1 under the optimized conditions. In situ extractive fermentation for hexanoic acid removal was then applied in a batch culture system with the optimized medium and 10% (v/v) alamine 336 in oleyl alcohol as an extractive solvent. The pH of the culture in the extractive fermentation was maintained at 5.4-5.6 by an acid balance between production and retrieval by extraction. During a 16 day culture, the hexanoic acid concentration in the solvent increased to 32gL(-1) while it was maintained in a range of 1-2gL(-1) in the medium. The maximum rate of hexanoic acid production was 0.34gL(-1)h(-1) in in situ extractive fermentation.
TI  - Protein identification in two phases of 1,3-propanediol production by proteomic analysis.
AB  - Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D)-mass spectrometry was  used to identify differentially expressed proteins in the Clostridium sp. native strain (IBUN 158B) in two phases of the 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production (lag phase and exponential growth phase). Intracellular protein fraction extraction conditions were standardised, as well as the 2D electrophoresis. Differences were found between both of the growth phases evaluated here. Thirty-two of the differentially expressed proteins were chosen to be identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF). The presence of four enzymes implicated in the 1,3-PD metabolic pathway was recorded: one from the reductive route (1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase) and three from the oxidative route (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase and phosphate butyryl transferase). The following enzymes which have not been previously reported for Clostridium sp., were also identified: phosphoglycerate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, deoxyribose phosphate aldolase, transketolase, cysteine synthetase, O-acetylhomoserine sulphhydrylase, glycyl-tRNA ligase, aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase, aconitate hydratase and the PrsA protein. The foregoing provides a novel contribution towards knowledge of the native strain for the purpose of designing genetic manipulation strategies to obtain strains with high production of 1,3-PD. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The article "Protein identification in two phases of 1,3-propanediol production by proteomic analysis" provides a novel contribution towards knowledge regarding the Colombian Clostridium sp. native strain (IBUN 158B) because this is a new approximation in comparative proteomics in two phases of the bacterial growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production conditions. The proteomic studies are very important to identify the enzymes that are expressed at different stages of production and therefore genes of interest in the genetic manipulation strategies; the results can be taken into account in future studies in metabolic engineering when optimising 1,3-PD production, in a cost-effective process having direct industrial applications.
TI  - Oceanirhabdus sediminicola gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from sea sediment.
AB  - A novel anaerobic bacterium, designated NH-JN4(T) was isolated from a sediment sample collected in the South China Sea. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, spore-forming, peritrichous and rod-shaped (0.5-1.2x2.2-7 microm). The temperature and pH ranges for growth were 22-42 degrees C and pH 6.0-8.5. Optimal growth occurred at 34-38 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0. The NaCl concentration range for growth was 0.5-6 % (w/v) with an optimum of 2.5 %. Catalase and oxidase were not produced. Substrates which could be utilized were peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, beef extract and glycine. Main fermentation products from PYG medium were formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Strain NH-JN4(T) could utilize sodium sulfite as an electron acceptor. No respiratory quinone was detected. The predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0 and C16 : 0 DMA. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids. The DNA G+C content was 35.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain NH-JN4(T) was a member of family Clostridiaceae, and was most closely related to Clostridium limosum ATCC 25620(T), Clostridium proteolyticum DSM 3090(T), Clostridium histolyticum ATCC 19401(T) and Clostridium tepidiprofundi SG 508(T), showing 94.0, 93.0, 92.9 and 92.3 % sequence similarity, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic properties, strain NH-JN4(T) represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Clostridiaceae, for which the name Oceanirhabdus sediminicola gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is NH-JN4(T) ( = JCM 18501(T) = CCTCC AB 2013103(T) = KCTC 15322(T)).
TI  - Mevalonate production by engineered acetogen biocatalyst during continuous fermentation of syngas or CO(2)/H(2) blend.
AB  - Naturally mevalonate-resistant acetogen Clostridium sp. MT1243 produced only 425  mM acetate during syngas fermentation. Using Clostridium sp. MT1243 we engineered biocatalyst selectively producing mevalonate from synthesis gas or CO(2)/H(2) blend. Acetate production and spore formation were eliminated from Clostridium sp. MT1243 using Cre-lox66/lox71-system. Cell energy released via elimination of phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase and early stage sporulation genes powered mevalonate accumulation in fermentation broth due to expression of synthetic thiolase, HMG-synthase, and HMG-reductase, three copies of each, integrated using Tn7-approach. Recombinants produced 145 mM mevalonate in five independent single-step fermentation runs 25 days each in five repeats using syngas blend 60% CO and 40% H(2) (v/v) (p < 0.005). Mevalonate production was 97 mM if only CO(2)/H(2) blend was fed instead of syngas (p < 0.005). Mevalonate from CO(2)/H(2) blend might serve as a commercial route to mitigate global warming in proportion to CO(2) fermentation scale worldwide.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Keratinibaculum paraultunense gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium with keratinolytic activity.
AB  - A novel thermophilic, anaerobic, keratinolytic bacterium designated KD-1 was isolated from grassy marshland. Strain KD-1 was a spore-forming rod with a Gram-positive type cell wall, but stained Gram-negative. The temperature, pH, and NaCl concentration range necessary for growth was 30-65 degrees C (optimum 55 degrees C), 6.0-10.5 (optimum 8.0-8.5), and 0-6% (optimum 0.2%) (w/v), respectively. Strain KD-1 possessed extracellular keratinase, and the optimum activity of the crude enzyme was pH 8.5 and 70 degrees C. The enzyme was identified as a thermostable serine-type protease. The strain was sensitive to rifampin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and tetracycline and was resistant to erythromycin, neomycin, penicillin, and streptomycin. The main cellular fatty acid was predominantly C15:0 iso (64%), and the G+C content was 28 mol%. Morphological and physiological characterization, together with phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified KD-1 as a new species of a novel genus of Clostridiaceae with 95.3%, 93.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Clostridium ultunense BS(T) (DSM 10521(T)) and Tepidimicrobium xylanilyticum PML14(T) (= JCM 15035(T)), respectively. We propose the name Keratinibaculum paraultunense gen. nov., sp. nov., with KD-1 (=JCM 18769(T) =DSM 26752(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Characterisation of the spoilage bacterial microbiota in oyster gills during storage at different temperatures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spoilage bacterial community in oyster gill was investigated during storage at 4, 10 and 20 degrees C. Aerobic plate counts and pH values were determined. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from oyster gill and bulk cells of plate count media. The major bacterial species during fresh or different temperatures storage were determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). RESULTS: The initial aerobic plate count in oyster gill reached 6.70 log CFU g(-1). PCR-DGGE fingerprinting analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region revealed that most of the strains in fresh oyster gill belonged to the genera Lactococcus and Enterobacter. The major spoilage bacteria at a storage temperature of 20 degrees C were Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, an uncultured bacterium, Cytophaga fermentans, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudoalteromonas sp., Enterococcus mundtii, Clostridium difficile and an uncultured Fusobacteria; those at 10 degrees C were Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus curvatus, Weissella confusa and C. difficile; those at 4 degrees C were Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterobacter and Aeromonas. The other minor species were L. curvatus, Pseudomonas sp. and E. mundtii. Lactococcus spp. was the most common main spoilage bacteria in oyster gill during chilled storage. CONCLUSION: PCR-DGGE revealed the complexity of the bacterial microbiota and the major bacteria species in oyster gill for fresh and storage.
TI  - Synthetic 2,3-butanediol pathway integrated using Tn7-tool and powered via elimination of sporulation and acetate production in acetogen biocatalyst.
AB  - Acetogen Clostridium sp. MT1802 originally producing 336-mM acetate from inorganic carbon of CO(2)/CO was engineered to eliminate acetate production and sporulation using Cre-lox66/lox71-approach. The recombinant started producing 105-mM formate expressing synthetic formate dehydrogenase integrated in two copies. Formate-producing recombinant was further engineered to express synthetic formate acetyltransferase, acetolactate synthase, acetolactate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase integrated in two copies each using Tn7 tool. The resulted recombinant started producing 102-mM 2,3-butanediol (23BD). 23BD production was confirmed in five independent single step fermentation runs 25 days long each in five repeats using syngas blend 60 % CO and 40 % H(2) (v/v) (p <0.005). 23BD production was 78 % if only CO(2)/H(2) blend was fed instead of syngas (p <0.005). 23BD from CO(2)/H(2) blend might serve as a commercial route to mitigate global warming in proportion to CO(2) fermentation scale worldwide.
TI  - Changes of poultry faecal microbiota associated with Clostridium difficile colonisation.
AB  - Bacterial, fungal and archaeal microbiota was analysed in 143 chicken faecal samples from a single poultry farm. After DHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) 15 bacterial groups, 10 fungal groups and a single archaeal species were differentiated. Samples were grouped into two clusters with significantly different frequencies of C. difficile positive and negative samples in each cluster. Acidaminococcus intestini, described here for the first time as a part of poultry faecal microbiota, was significantly more likely present in C. difficile negative samples, while presence/absence of some other microorganisms (Enterococcus cecorum, Lactobacillus galinarum, Moniliella sp. and Trichosporon asahii) was close to significance. Two other groups not reported previously for poultry, Coprobacillus sp. and Turicibacter sp. did not differ significantly between C. difficile positive and negative samples. Differences in microbiota diversity depend on animal age, but not on the presence of C. difficile. With machine learning (WEKA J48) we have defined specific combinations of microbial groups predictive for C. difficile colonisation. Microbial groups associated with C. difficile colonisation in poultry are different than those reported for humans and include bacteria as well as fungi. Also with this approach A. intestini was found to be most strongly related to C. difficile negative samples.
TI  - Characterization of a D-psicose-producing enzyme, D-psicose 3-epimerase, from Clostridium sp.
AB  - The gene coding for D-psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase) from Clostridium sp. BNL1100 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. It was a metal-dependent enzyme and required Co(2+) as optimum cofactor. It displayed catalytic activity maximally at pH 8.0 and 65 degrees C (as measured over 5 min). The optimum substrate was D-psicose, and the K m, turnover number (k cat), and catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for D-psicose were 227 mM, 32,185 min(-1), and 141 min(-1 )mM(-1), respectively. At pH 8.0 and 55 degrees C, 120 g D-psicose l(-1) was produced from 500 g D-fructose l(-1) after 5 h.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three Brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. The extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. The propolis extracts inhibited the growth of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, Ruminococcus albus 7, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1, Prevotella albensis M384, Peptostreptococcus sp. D1, Clostridium aminophilum F and Streptococcus bovis Pearl11, while R. albus 20, Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 and Ruminobacter amylophilus H18 were resistant to all the extracts. The inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (C. aminophilum F and Peptostreptococcus sp. D1) being the most sensitive. Inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. The extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (LLOS C3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. The major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and Artepillin C) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains. Only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.
TI  - Gene replacement and elimination using lambdaRed- and FLP-based tool to re-direct carbon flux in acetogen biocatalyst during continuous CO(2)/H(2) blend fermentation.
AB  - A time- and cost-efficient two-step gene elimination procedure was used for acetogen Clostridium sp. MT1834 capable of fermenting CO(2)/H(2) blend to 245 mM acetate (p < 0.005). The first step rendered the targeted gene replacement without affecting the total genome size. We replaced the acetate pta-ack cluster with synthetic bi-functional acetaldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (al-adh). Replacement of pta-ack with al-adh rendered initiation of 243 mM ethanol accumulation at the expense of acetate production during CO(2)/H(2) blend continuous fermentation (p < 0.005). At the second step, al-adh was eliminated to reduce the genome size. Resulting recombinants accumulated 25 mM mevalonate in fermentation broth (p < 0.005). Cell duplication time for recombinants with reduced genome size decreased by 9.5 % compared to Clostridium sp. MT1834 strain under the same fermentation conditions suggesting better cell energy pool management in the absence of the ack-pta gene cluster in the engineered biocatalyst. If the first gene elimination step was used alone for spo0A gene replacement with two copies of synthetic formate dehydrogenase in recombinants with a shortened genome, mevalonate production was replaced with 76.5 mM formate production in a single step continuous CO(2)/H(2) blend fermentation (p < 0.005) with cell duplication time almost nearing that of the wild strain.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection in horses: a review.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea  and enterocolitis in horses. Foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. The highly resistant spore of C. difficile is the infectious unit of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces of other animals. Two major risk factors for the development of C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of CDAD can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. The most common antibiotics associated with CDAD in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides, beta-lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Clinical signs and intestinal lesions of CDAD infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by C. difficile from infections by other agents, such as Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella sp. The distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. Small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals<1-month old. Naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine. Detection of toxin A, toxin B or both in intestinal contents or feces is considered the most reliable diagnostic criterion for CDAD in horses. Isolation of toxigenic strains of C. difficile from horses with intestinal disease is highly suggestive of CDAD. A better understanding of pathogenesis, reservoirs of infection, and vaccines and other methods of control is needed. Also further studies are recommended to investigate other possible predisposing factors and/or etiological agents of enteric diseases of horses.
TI  - Characterization of four TCE-dechlorinating microbial enrichments grown with different cobalamin stress and methanogenic conditions.
AB  - To investigate the important supportive microorganisms responsible for trichloroethene (TCE) bioremediation under specific environmental conditions and their relationship with Dehalococcoides (Dhc), four stable and robust enrichment cultures were generated using contaminated groundwater. Enrichments were maintained under four different conditions exploring two parameters: high and low TCE amendments (resulting in inhibited and uninhibited methanogenic activity, respectively) and with and without vitamin B(1)(2) amendment. Lactate was supplied as the electron donor. All enrichments were capable of reductively dechlorinating TCE to vinyl chloride and ethene. The dechlorination rate and ethene generation were higher, and the proportion of electrons used for dechlorination increased when methanogenesis was inhibited. Biologically significant cobalamin biosynthesis was detected in the enrichments without B(1)(2) amendment. Comparative genomics using a genus-wide microarray revealed a Dhc genome similar to that of strain 195 in all enrichments, a strain that lacks the major upstream corrin ring biosynthesis pathway. Seven other bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected using clone libraries. OTUs closest to Pelosinus, Dendrosporobacter, and Sporotalea (PDS) were most dominant. The Clostridium-like OTU was most affected by B(1)(2) amendment and active methanogenesis. Principal component analysis revealed that active methanogenesis, rather than vitamin B(1)(2) limitation, exerted a greater effect on the community structures even though methanogens did not seem to play an essential role in providing corrinoids to Dhc. In contrast, acetogenic bacteria that were abundant in the enrichments, such as PDS and Clostridium sp., may be potential corrinoid providers for Dhc.
TI  - Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Three Gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, spindle-shaped bacterial strains (HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111), isolated from human faeces were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the strains were highly related to each other genetically (displaying >99 % sequence similarity) and represented a previously unknown subline within the Blautia coccoides rRNA group of organisms (cluster XIVa). The closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain HT03-11(T) were Clostridium bolteae WAL 16351(T) (93.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1(T) (93.7 % similarity). All isolates produced lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid as fermentation end products from glucose. Their chemotaxonomic properties included lysine as the cell wall diamino acid and C16 : 0, C18 : 1omega7c DMA and C16 : 0 DMA as the major fatty acids. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA were 46.9-47.2 mol% (HPLC). Several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics could be readily used to differentiate the isolates from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strains HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is HT03-11(T) ( = YIT 12554(T) = JCM 18507(T) = DSM 26062(T)).
TI  - The pathology of enterotoxemia by Clostridium perfringens type C in calves.
AB  - The pathology of Clostridium perfringens type C infection has been described with detail only in foals and piglets. The current report describes the diagnostic workup and detailed pathology of 3 cases of C. perfringens type C infection in calves. A 2-day-old Jersey calf and fresh and fixed tissues from a 4-week-old Angus calf and from a 1-week-old Jersey calf were received at the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System with a history of digestive disease and death. The gross changes in the gastrointestinal tract of 1 calf consisted of multifocal subserosal hemorrhages of the rumen, diffuse congestion and multifocal hemorrhages of the small intestinal mucosa, and dilated cecum with bloody liquid contents. In a second calf, a large segment of small intestine was hemorrhagic. The small intestine of the third calf was dilated and filled with abundant yellow fluid content. Microscopically, all 3 calves had diffuse coagulation necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. Clostridium perfringens type A was isolated from the intestinal content of 2 calves. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Bovine rotavirus was positive on colonic content of 1 calf. Small numbers of cryptosporidia were seen in smears of colonic content of 2 calves, and Salmonella sp. group E was detected in the small intestinal content of another calf. Clostridium perfringens beta toxin was detected in the intestinal content of the 3 animals. A diagnosis of C. perfringens type C infection was confirmed based on pathological findings and detection of beta toxin in the intestinal content of the 3 animals.
TI  - Effect of initial pH on mesophilic hydrolysis and acidification of swine manure.
AB  - Effects of initial pH (3-12) on mesophilic hydrolysis and acidification reactions of swine manure was studied. The initial pH changed the microbial community in the suspension so as to affect hydrolysis and acidification reactions on swine manure. At pH 10-12 the Clostridium alkalicellum and/or Corynebacterium humireducens were enriched and the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), proteins and carbohydrates from manure were increased in quantities. In particular, at pH 10 the VFA concentration peaked at 13,600 mg-COD/L, with acetate and propionate accounting for 71.8% of the total VFAs. Acidic environment facilitates release of ammonium from manure. The Butyricimonas sp. was found existing at initial pH 5 which led to accumulated quantities of butyrate. Initial pH adjustment was revealed to be an effective way to manipulate rates and end products of hydrolysis and acidification of swine manure.
TI  - Bioreduction and precipitation of uranium in ionic liquid aqueous solution by Clostridium sp.
AB  - The ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6], N-ethylpyridiniumtrifluoroacetate [EtPy][CF3COO] and N-ethylpyridiniumtetrafluoroborate [EtPy][BF4], affected the reduction and precipitation of uranium by Clostridium sp. to a varying degree. Characterization of uranium association with the ionic liquids showed that uranium formed a monodentate complex with the anion BF4(-) and PF6(-) of [EtPy][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6], respectively; and a bidentate complex with carboxylate of [EtPy][CF3COO]. Bioreduction of U(VI) was influenced by the type of complex formed: monodentate complexes were readily reduced whereas the bidentate complex of U(VI) with [CF3COO] was recalcitrant. [EtPy][BF4] affected the rate and extent of precipitation of the reduced uranium; at higher concentration the reduced U(IV) remained in the solution phase. The results suggest that by tuning the properties of ionic liquids they may be valuable candidates for uranium biotreatment.
TI  - Oral administration of heparin or heparosan increases the Lactobacillus population in gut microbiota of rats.
AB  - Heparin and heparosan have been confirmed to be effective blockers in inhibiting  adhesion of pathogens in vitro. However, their effects on gut microbiota in vivo remain unknown. Here we have studied the effects of oral administration of heparin or heparosan on gut microbiota in rats by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Results showed that the predominant bacterial communities in the feces of heparin- or heparosan-treated animals were different from those of the saline-treated animals, with increased Lactobacillus spp. and decreased Enterococcus sp. Different DGGE banding patterns were also observed for the subpopulations of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides groups. In conclusion, heparin or heparosan may be used as an effective gut microbiota modulator by increasing the subpopulation of Lactobacillus.
TI  - Pyrosequencing reveals the key microorganisms involved in sludge alkaline fermentation for efficient short-chain fatty acids production.
AB  - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been regarded as the excellent carbon source of wastewater biological nutrient removal, and sludge alkaline (pH 10) fermentation has been reported to achieve highly efficient SCFAs production. In this study, the underlying mechanisms for the improved SCFAs production at pH 10 were investigated by using 454 pyrosequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the microbial community structures in sludge fermentation reactors. It was found that sludge fermentation at pH 10 increased the abundances of Pseudomonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp., which were able to excrete extracellular proteases and depolymerases, and thus enhanced the hydrolysis of insoluble sludge protein and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Meanwhile, the abundance of acid-producing bacteria (such as Clostridium sp.) in the reactor of pH 10 was also higher than that of uncontrolled pH, which benefited the acidification of soluble organic substrates. Further study indicated that sludge fermentation at pH 10 significantly decreased the number of methanogenic archaea, resulting in lower SCFAs consumption and lower methane production. Therefore, anaerobic sludge fermentation under alkaline conditions increased the abundances of bacteria involved in sludge hydrolysis and acidification, and decreased the abundance of methanogenic archaea, which favored the competition of bacteria over methanogens and resulted in the efficient production of SCFAs.
TI  - Dynamics of predominant microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract and change in luminal enzymes and immunoglobulin profile during high-altitude adaptation.
AB  - High-altitude (HA) visitors like pilgrims, trackers, scientists and military personnel face a group of nonspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia. In order to investigate the alteration of indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota in the development of such GI symptoms, an experiment was conducted for the enumeration of dominant cultivable faecal microbiota of 15 soldiers at base level (Delhi) and during their 15-day acclimatization at 3,505 m HA (Leh). At HA, faecal microbiota analysis revealed that total aerobes decreased significantly with increase of total and facultative anaerobes. The strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroidetes sp. and Lactobacillus sp. exhibited positive growth direction index (GDI) like other predominant obligate anaerobes Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. Different enzymes like amylase, proteinase and polyphenol hydrolase produced by different bacterial populations showed positive GDI, whereas phosphatase producers exhibited negative GDI. The levels of microbe-originated enzymes like amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated during HA acclimatization. In addition, in vitro gas production ability was enhanced with increase of faecal immunoglobulins IgA and IgG. We demonstrated that hypoxic environment at HA had the potential to alter the gut microbial composition and its activities that may cause GI dysfunctions.
TI  - Propionyl-CoA dependent biosynthesis of 2-hydroxybutyrate containing polyhydroxyalkanoates in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid containing polyesters including polylactic acid (PLA), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)], and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-2-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-2HB-co-LA)] employing metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved Clostridium propionicum propionyl-CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)). In this study, we further engineered in vivo PLA biosynthesis system in E. coli to synthesize 2HB-containing PHA, in which propionyl-CoA was used as precursor for 2-ketobutyrate that was converted into 2HB-CoA by the sequential actions of Lactococcus lactis (D)-2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (PanE) and Pct(Cp) and then 2HB-CoA was polymerized by PhaC1(Ps6-19). The recombinant E. coli XL1-blue expressing the phaC1437 gene, the pct540 gene, and the Ralstonia eutropha prpE gene together with the panE gene could be grown to 0.66 g/L and successfully produced P(70 mol%3HB-co-18 mol%2HB-co-12 mol%LA) up to the PHA content of 66 wt% from 20 g/L of glucose, 2 g/L of 3HB and 1 g/L of sodium propionate. Removal of the prpC gene in the chromosome of E. coli XL1-blue could increase the mole fraction of 2HB in copolymer, but the PHA content was decreased. The metabolic engineering strategy reported here suggests that propionyl-CoA can be successfully used as the precursor to provide PHA synthase with 2HB-CoA for the production of PHAs containing 2HB monomer.
TI  - Selective methanol or formate production during continuous CO(2) fermentation by  the acetogen biocatalysts engineered via integration of synthetic pathways using Tn7-tool.
AB  - Methanol-resistant mutant acetogen Clostridium sp. MT1424 originally producing only 365 mM acetate from CO(2)/CO was engineered to eliminate acetate production and spore formation using Cre-lox66/lox71-system to power subsequent methanol production via expressing synthetic methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, three copies of each, assembled in cluster and integrated to chromosome using Tn7-based approach. Production of 2.2 M methanol was steady (p < 0.005) in single step fermentations of 20 % CO(2) + 80 % H(2) blend (v/v) 25 day runs each in five independent repeats. If the integrated cluster comprised only three copies of formate dehydrogenase the respective recombinants produced 95 mM formate (p < 0.005) under the same conditions. For commercialization, the suggested source of inorganic carbon would be CO(2) waste of IGCC power plant. Hydrogen may be produced in situ via powered by solar panels electrolysis.
TI  - Deriving metabolic engineering strategies from genome-scale modeling with flux ratio constraints.
AB  - Optimized production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from microbial cell factories is a central goal of systems metabolic engineering. To achieve this goal, a new computational method of using flux balance analysis with flux ratios (FBrAtio) was further developed in this research and applied to five case studies to evaluate and design metabolic engineering strategies. The approach was implemented using publicly available genome-scale metabolic flux models. Synthetic pathways were added to these models along with flux ratio constraints by FBrAtio to achieve increased (i) cellulose production from Arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) isobutanol production from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; (iii) acetone production from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803; (iv) H2 production from Escherichia coli MG1655; and (v) isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (IBE) production from engineered Clostridium acetobutylicum. The FBrAtio approach was applied to each case to simulate a metabolic engineering strategy already implemented experimentally, and flux ratios were continually adjusted to find (i) the end-limit of increased production using the existing strategy, (ii) new potential strategies to increase production, and (iii) the impact of these metabolic engineering strategies on product yield and culture growth. The FBrAtio approach has the potential to design "fine-tuned" metabolic engineering strategies in silico that can be implemented directly with available genomic tools.
TI  - Co-culturing a novel Bacillus strain with Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 to produce butyric acid from sucrose.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the most promising microorganism used for the bio-production of butyric acid is Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755T; however, it is unable to use sucrose as a sole carbon source. Consequently, a newly isolated strain, Bacillus sp. SGP1, that was found to produce a levansucrase enzyme, which hydrolyzes sucrose into fructose and glucose, was used in a co-culture with this strain, permitting C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755T to ferment sucrose to butyric acid. RESULTS: B. sp. SGP1 alone did not show any butyric acid production and the main metabolite produced was lactic acid. This allowed C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755T to utilize the monosaccharides resulting from the activity of levansucrase together with the lactic acid produced by B. sp. SGP1 to generate butyric acid, which was the main fermentative product within the co-culture. Furthermore, the final acetic acid concentration in the co-culture was significantly lower when compared with pure C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755T cultures grown on glucose. In fed-batch fermentations, the optimum conditions for the production of butyric acid were around pH 5.50 and a temperature of 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, the final butyrate concentration was 34.2+/-1.8 g/L with yields of 0.35+/-0.03 g butyrate/g sucrose and maximum productivity of 0.3+/-0.04 g/L/h. CONCLUSIONS: Using this co-culture, sucrose can be utilized as a carbon source for butyric acid production at a relatively high yield. In addition, this co-culture offers also the benefit of a greater selectivity, with butyric acid constituting 92.8% of the acids when the fermentation was terminated.
TI  - Isolation and Characterization of a Bacteriocin-Like Substance Produced by Geobacillus toebii Strain HBB-247.
AB  - A total of 201 thermophilic bacteria isolated from various thermal spring, mud and soil were tested for their antibacterial activity. Among the mostly active isolates, Geobacillus toebii HBB-247 was further examined. Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by strain HBB-247 was found to be stable up to 60 degrees C, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria sp., E. avium, Clostridium pasteurianum, Cellulomonas fimi and some thermophilic strains isolated and identified in this study. As a result of Tricine-SDS-PAGE molecular weight of BLIS was estimated about 38 kDa. Production studies showed that G. toebii HBB-247 starts to produce antibacterial substance at early logarithmic phase of growth and maximum production was detected at the end of the logarithmic phase.
TI  - Single-step ethanol production from lignocellulose using novel extremely thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol using thermophilic bacteria provides a promising solution for efficient lignocellulose conversion without the need for additional cellulolytic enzymes. Most studies on the thermophilic CBP concentrate on co-cultivation of the thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum with non-cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobes at temperatures of 55 degrees C-60 degrees C. RESULTS: We have specifically screened for cellulolytic bacteria growing at temperatures >70 degrees C to enable direct conversion of lignocellulosic materials into ethanol. Seven new strains of extremely thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor and eight new strains of extremely thermophilic xylanolytic/saccharolytic bacteria of the genus Thermoanaerobacter isolated from environmental samples exhibited fast growth at 72 degrees C, extensive lignocellulose degradation and high yield ethanol production on cellulose and pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Monocultures of Caldicellulosiruptor strains degraded up to 89-97% of the cellulose and hemicellulose polymers in pretreated biomass and produced up to 72 mM ethanol on cellulose without addition of exogenous enzymes. In dual co-cultures of Caldicellulosiruptor strains with Thermoanaerobacter strains the ethanol concentrations rose 2- to 8.2-fold compared to cellulolytic monocultures. A co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor DIB 087C and Thermoanaerobacter DIB 097X was particularly effective in the conversion of cellulose to ethanol, ethanol comprising 34.8 mol% of the total organic products. In contrast, a co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus DSM 8903 and Thermoanaerobacter mathranii subsp. mathranii DSM 11426 produced only low amounts of ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: The newly discovered Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain DIB 004C was capable of producing unexpectedly large amounts of ethanol from lignocellulose in fermentors. The established co-cultures of new Caldicellulosiruptor strains with new Thermoanaerobacter strains underline the importance of using specific strain combinations for high ethanol yields. These co-cultures provide an efficient CBP pathway for ethanol production and represent an ideal starting point for development of a highly integrated commercial ethanol production process.
TI  - Microbial community signature of high-solid content methanogenic ecosystems.
AB  - In this study, changes in bacterial and archaeal communities involved in anaerobic digestion processes operated with high solid contents were investigated. Batch tests were performed within a range of total solids (TS) of 10-35%. Between 10% and 25% TS, high methanogenic activity was observed and no overall specific structure of active bacterial communities was found. At 30% and 35%, methanogenesis was inhibited as a consequence of volatile fatty acids accumulation. Here, a specific bacterial signature was observed with three main dominant bacteria related to Clostridium sp., known for their ability to grow at low pH. Additionally, archaeal community was gradually impacted by TS content. Three archaeal community structures were observed with a gradual shift from Methanobacterium sp. to Methanosarcina sp., according to the TS content. Overall, several species were identified as biomarkers of methanogenesis inhibition, since bacterial and archaeal communities were highly specific at high TS contents.
TI  - Physicochemical studies and biological evaluation on (E)-3-(2-(1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)hydrazinyl)-3-oxo-N-(thiazol-2yl)propanamide complexes.
AB  - Hydrazone complexes of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Pd(II), Cd(II), Zn(II) and U(VI)O2 with (E)-3-(2-(1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)hydrazinyl)-3-oxo-N-(thiazol-2yl)propanamide (H2o-HAH) have been synthesized. The complex structure has been elucidated by analysis (elemental and thermal), spectroscopy ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, UV-visible, ESR, MS) and physical measurements (magnetic susceptibility and molar conductance). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the different decomposition steps of some complexes have been calculated using the Coats-Redfern equation. Also, the association and formation constants of Co(II) ion in absolute ethanol solutions at 294.15K have been calculated by using electrical conductance. Moreover, the ligand and its complexes have been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli and Clostridium sp.) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus sp. and Stemphylium sp.) by MIC method.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the CspB protease required for Clostridium  spore germination.
AB  - Spores are the major transmissive form of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile, a leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea worldwide. Successful transmission of C. difficile requires that its hardy, resistant spores germinate into vegetative cells in the gastrointestinal tract. A critical step during this process is the degradation of the spore cortex, a thick layer of peptidoglycan surrounding the spore core. In Clostridium sp., cortex degradation depends on the proteolytic activation of the cortex hydrolase, SleC. Previous studies have implicated Csps as being necessary for SleC cleavage during germination; however, their mechanism of action has remained poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that CspB is a subtilisin-like serine protease whose activity is essential for efficient SleC cleavage and C. difficile spore germination. By solving the first crystal structure of a Csp family member, CspB, to 1.6 A, we identify key structural domains within CspB. In contrast with all previously solved structures of prokaryotic subtilases, the CspB prodomain remains tightly bound to the wildtype subtilase domain and sterically occludes a catalytically competent active site. The structure, combined with biochemical and genetic analyses, reveals that Csp proteases contain a unique jellyroll domain insertion critical for stabilizing the protease in vitro and in C. difficile. Collectively, our study provides the first molecular insight into CspB activity and function. These studies may inform the development of inhibitors that can prevent clostridial spore germination and thus disease transmission.
TI  - Non-contiguous finished genome sequence and description of Clostridium senegalense sp. nov.
AB  - Clostridium senegalense strain JC122(T), is the type strain of Clostridium senegalense sp. nov., a new species within the genus Clostridium. This strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from the fecal flora of a healthy patient. C. senegalense strain JC122(T) is an obligate anaerobic Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 3,893,008 bp long genome (1 chromosome but no plasmid) exhibits a G+C content of 26.8% and contains 3,704 protein-coding and 57 RNA genes, including 6 rRNA genes.
TI  - Draft Genome Sequence of Clostridium sp. Maddingley, Isolated from Coal-Seam Gas  Formation Water.
AB  - Clostridium sp. Maddingley was isolated as an axenic culture from a brown coal-seam formation water sample collected from Victoria, Australia. It lacks the solventogenesis genes found in closely related clostridial strains. Metabolic reconstructions suggest that volatile fatty acids are the main fermentation end products.
TI  - Short-chain fatty acid production from different biological phosphorus removal sludges: the influences of PHA and Gram-staining bacteria.
AB  - Recently, the reuse of waste activated sludge to produce short-chain fatty acids  (SCFA) has attracted much attention. However, the influences of sludge characteristics, especially polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and Gram-staining bacteria, on SCFA production have seldom been investigated. It was found in this study that during sludge anaerobic fermentation not only the fermentation time but also the SCFA production were different between two sludges, which had different PHA contents and Gram-negative bacteria to Gram-positive bacteria (GNB/GPB) ratios and were generated respectively from the anaerobic/oxic (AO) and aerobic/extended-idle (AEI) biological phosphorus removal processes. The optimal fermentation time for the AEI and AO sludges was respectively 4 and 8 d, and the corresponding SCFA production was 304.6 and 231.0 mg COD/g VSS (volatile suspended solids) in the batch test and 143.4 and 103.9 mg COD/g VSS in the semicontinuous experiment. The mechanism investigation showed that the AEI sludge had greater PHA content and GNB/GPB ratio, and the increased PHA content accelerated cell lysis and soluble substrate hydrolysis while the increased GNB/GPB ratio benefited cell lysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles revealed that the microbial community in the AEI sludge fermentation reactor was dominated by Clostridium sp., which was reported to be SCFA-producing microbes. Further enzyme analyses indicated that the activities of key hydrolytic and acids-forming enzymes in the AEI sludge fermentation reactor were higher than those in the AO one. Thus, less fermentation time was required, but higher SCFA was produced in the AEI sludge fermentation system.
TI  - Microbial consortia for hydrogen production enhancement.
AB  - Ten efficient hydrogen-producing strains affiliated to the Clostridium genus were used to develop consortia for hydrogen production. In order to determine their saccharolytic and proteolytic activities, glucose and meat extract were tested as fermentation substrates, and the best hydrogen-producing strains were selected. The C. roseum H5 (glucose-consuming) and C. butyricum R4 (protein-degrading) co-culture was the best hydrogen-producing co-culture. The end-fermentation products for the axenic cultures and co-cultures were analyzed. In all cases, organic acids, mainly butyrate and acetate, were produced lowering the pH and thus inhibiting further hydrogen production. In order to replace the need for reducing agents for the anaerobic growth of clostridia, a microbial consortium including Clostridium spp. and an oxygen-consuming microorganism able to form dense granules (Streptomyces sp.) was created. Increased yields of hydrogen were achieved. The effect of adding a butyrate-degrading bacteria and an acetate-consuming archaea to the consortia was also studied.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (UC), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of UC. METHODS: The fecal microbiota of 30 UC samples obtained from 15 patients who were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with UC and the control subjects (P = 0.0004). UC-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with UC. Significant reduction of bacterial diversity of members of the Clostridium cluster IV and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including Ruminococcus bromii et rel. Eubacterium rectale et rel., Roseburia sp., and Akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in UC. Increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including Fusobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., Helicobacter sp., and Campylobacter sp. as well as Clostridium difficile were found to be associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Dysbiosis in UC is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. The microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and evaluation of hyper 2-propanol producing bacteria from Singapore environment.
AB  - Three hyper 2-propanol producing strains were isolated from Singapore environment using an enrichment step and a high through-put screening step. The analysis of the amplified 16S rDNA revealed that the isolates belonged to Clostridium species and they were named as Clostridium sp. BT10-1, Clostridium sp. M10-1 and Clostridium sp. PU31-4. At 1 L scale, the 2-propanol titer of these positive strains was 1.6-2.1 times of that of Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B593, which is so far the most efficient natural 2-propanol producer. The highest 2-propanol titer was achieved by isolate BT10-6 and it was 5.26 g/L (87.5 mM). These three positive strains BT10-6, M10-1 and PU31-4 consumed glucose almost completely in 40-48 h and gave 2-propanol productivity at 0.132, 0.118 and 0.087 g/L/h, respectively, which is 3.0-4.6 times of 0.029 g/L/h given by C. beijerinckii NRRL B593. Butanol was also produced by these positive strains with a slightly lower butanol titer and higher butanol productivity, compared to butanol control strain C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052.
TI  - Enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  - Gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (Astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. The gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. In this work, gum tragacanth from Astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using Aspergillus niger pectinases (Pectinex BE Color). The enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: HAG1 < 2 kDa; 2 kDa < HAG2 < 10 kDa; HAG3 > 10 kDa. Compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: HAG1 and HAG2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas HAG3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. The growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), B. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), Lactobacillus acidophilus , B. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of Clostridium perfringens . The fractions HAG1 and HAG2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than HAG3, especially of the three B. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on HAG1 and HAG2 was better than that on galactan (control). HAG3 completely inhibited the growth of the C. perfringens strain. Tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.
TI  - Distinct actions by Paenibacillus sp. strain E18 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases and xylanase in xylan degradation.
AB  - We cloned a Paenibacillus sp. strain E18 5.3-kb xylanolytic gene cluster that contains three open reading frames encoding two family 43 alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases (Abf43A and Abf43B) and one family 10 xylanase (XynBE18). The deduced amino acid sequences of Abf43A and Abf43B were at most 68% and 63% identical to those of two putative family 43 proteins from Clostridium sp. strain DL-VIII (EHI98634.1 and EHI98635.1), respectively, but were only 11% identical to each other. Recombinant Abf43A and Abf43B had similar activities at 45 degrees C and pH 6.0 but varied in thermostabilities and substrate specificities. Abf43B was active against only 4-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, whereas Abf43A acted on 4-nitrophenyl alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, wheat arabinoxylan, 4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-xylopyranoside, and sugar beet arabinan. The sequential and combined effects on xylan degradation by XynBE18, Abf43A, and Abf43B were characterized. For beechwood, birchwood, and oat spelt xylans as the substrates, synergistic effects were found when XynBE18 and Abf43A or Abf43B were incubated together and when the substrates were first incubated with Abf43A or Abf43B and then with XynBE18. Further high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the amounts of xylobiose and xylose increased sharply in the aforementioned reactions. For water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate, Abf43A not only released arabinose but also had a synergistic effect with XynBE18. Synergy may arise as the result of removal of arabinose residues from xylans by alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases, which eliminates steric hindrance caused by the arabinose side chains and which allows xylanases to then degrade the xylan backbone, producing short xylooligosaccharides.
TI  - Hydrogen-producing microflora and Fe-Fe hydrogenase diversities in seaweed bed associated with marine hot springs of Kalianda, Indonesia.
AB  - Microbial fermentation is a promising technology for hydrogen (H(2)) production.  H(2) producers in marine geothermal environments are thermophilic and halotolerant. However, no one has surveyed an environment specifically for thermophilic bacteria that produce H(2) through Fe-Fe hydrogenases (H(2)ase). Using heterotrophic medium, several microflora from a seaweed bed associated with marine hot springs were enriched and analyzed for H(2) production. A H(2)-producing microflora was obtained from Sargassum sp., 16S rRNA genes and Fe-Fe H(2)ase diversities of this enrichment were also analyzed. Based on 16S rRNA genes analysis, 10 phylotypes were found in the H(2)-producing microflora showing 90.0-99.5 % identities to known species, and belonged to Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacillales. Clostridia were the most abundant group, and three Clostridia phylotypes were most related to known H(2) producers such as Anaerovorax odorimutans (94.0 % identity), Clostridium papyrosolvens (98.4 % identity), and Clostridium tepidiprofundi (93.1 % identity). For Fe-Fe H(2)ases, seven phylotypes were obtained, showing 63-97 % identities to known Fe-Fe H(2)ases, and fell into four distinct clusters. Phylotypes HW55-3 and HM55-1 belonged to thermophilic and salt-tolerant H(2)-producing Clostridia, Halothermothrix orenii-like Fe-Fe H(2)ases (80 % identity), and cellulolytic H(2)-producing Clostridia, C. papyrosolvens-like Fe-Fe H(2)ases (97 % identity), respectively. The results of both 16S rRNA genes and Fe-Fe H(2)ases surveys suggested that the thermophilic and halotolerant H(2)-producing microflora in seaweed bed of hot spring area represented previously unknown H(2) producers, and have potential application for H(2) production.
TI  - Evaluation of biodegradable plastics as solid hydrogen donors for the reductive dechlorination of fthalide by Dehalobacter species.
AB  - Biodegradable plastics (BPs) were evaluated for their applicability as sustainable and solid H(2) donors for microbial reductive dechlorination of 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorophthalide (fthalide). After a screening test of several BPs, the starch-based plastic (SP) that produced the highest levels of H(2) was selected for its use as the sole H(2) donor in this reaction. Fthalide dechlorination was successfully accomplished by combining an H(2)-producing SP culture and a KFL culture containing Dehalobacter species, supplemented with 0.13% and 0.5% SP, respectively. The efficiency of H(2) use in dechlorination was evaluated in a combined culture containing the KFL culture and strain Clostridium sp. Ma13, a new isolate that produces H(2) from SP. Results obtained with this culture indicated increased H(2)-fraction for fthalide dechlorination much more in this culture than in compared with a KFL culture supplemented with 20mM lactate, which are 0.75 H(2).glucose(-1) and 0.015 H(2).lactate(-1) in mol ratio, respectively.
TI  - [Improvement of the method of isolation of hydrogen-forming bacteria of Clostridium genus].
AB  - The method of isolation and quantitative account of pure cultures of obligate anaerobic hydrogen-forming clostridia is improved. A strain of hydrogen-forming bacteria Clostridium sp. BY-11 has been isolated from the association of sporulating bacteria. Quantitative indices of hydrogen synthesis and starch fermentation have been determined when growing the strain in the liquid medium. Concentration of H2 in the gas phase was 49%, microorganisms synthesized 128 1 of H2 from 1 kg of starch, the mass of starch decreased 7 times for 6 days. The mentioned indices for hydrogen synthesis and starch fermentation and for other organic model substrates in the future are the basis for creating the industrial biotechnology for production of hydrogen as the energy carrier under disposal of ecologically dangerous solid food waste.
TI  - SpoIVA and SipL are Clostridium difficile spore morphogenetic proteins.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen whose infections are difficult to treat because of their frequent recurrence. The spores of C. difficile are responsible for these clinical features, as they resist common disinfectants and antibiotic treatment. Although spores are the major transmissive form of C. difficile, little is known about their composition or morphogenesis. Spore morphogenesis has been well characterized for Bacillus sp., but Bacillus sp. spore coat proteins are poorly conserved in Clostridium sp. Of the known spore morphogenetic proteins in Bacillus subtilis, SpoIVA is one of the mostly highly conserved in the Bacilli and the Clostridia. Using genetic analyses, we demonstrate that SpoIVA is required for proper spore morphogenesis in C. difficile. In particular, a spoIVA mutant exhibits defects in spore coat localization but not cortex formation. Our study also identifies SipL, a previously uncharacterized protein found in proteomic studies of C. difficile spores, as another critical spore morphogenetic protein, since a sipL mutant phenocopies a spoIVA mutant. Biochemical analyses and mutational analyses indicate that SpoIVA and SipL directly interact. This interaction depends on the Walker A ATP binding motif of SpoIVA and the LysM domain of SipL. Collectively, these results provide the first insights into spore morphogenesis in C. difficile.
TI  - Selective n-butanol production by Clostridium sp. MTButOH1365 during continuous synthesis gas fermentation due to expression of synthetic thiolase, 3-hydroxy butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonase, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, and NAD-dependent butanol dehydrogenase.
AB  - Acetogen Clostridum sp. MT1962 produced 287 mM acetate (p < 0.005) and 293 mM ethanol (p < 0.005) fermenting synthesis gas blend 60% CO and 40% H(2) in single-stage continuous fermentation. This strain was metabolically engineered to the biocatalyst Clostridium sp. MTButOH1365. The engineered biocatalyst lost production of ethanol and acetate while initiated the production of 297 mM of n-butanol (p < 0.005). The metabolic engineering comprised Cre-lox66/lox71-based elimination of phosphotransacetylase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase along with integration to chromosome synthetic thiolase, 3-hydroxy butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonase, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, and NAD-dependent butanol dehydrogenase. This is the first report on elimination of acetate and ethanol production genes and expression of synthetic gene cluster encoding n-butanol biosynthesis pathway in acetogen biocatalyst for selective fuel n-butanol production with no antibiotic support for the introduced genes.
TI  - Combination of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) for berberine reduction from wastewater and the effects of berberine on bacterial community dynamics.
AB  - Berberine is a broad-spectrum antibiotic extensively used in personal medication. The production of berberine results in the generation of wastewater containing concentrated residual berberine. However, few related studies up to date focus on berberine removal from wastewaters. In this study, a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)-membrane bioreactor (MBR) process was developed for berberine removal from synthetic wastewater. The performance of the UASB-MBR system on berberine, COD and NH(4)(+)--N removal was investigated at different berberine loadings. And the effects of berberine on bacterial communities were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Results showed that, as the increase of berberine loadings, UASB performance was affected remarkably, whereas, efficient and stable performance of MBR ensured the overall removal rates of berberine, COD and NH(4)(+)--N consistently reached up to 99%, 98% and 98%, respectively. Significant shifts of bacterial community structures were detected in both UASB and MBR, especially in the initial operations. Along with the increase of berberine loadings, high antibiotic resisting species and some functional species, i.e. Acinetobacter sp., Clostridium sp., Propionibacterium sp., and Sphingomonas sp. in UASB, as well as Sphingomonas sp., Methylocystis sp., Hydrogenophaga sp. and Flavobacterium sp. in MBR were enriched in succession.
TI  - "Curing" of plasmid DNA in acetogen using microwave or applying an electric pulse improves cell growth and metabolite production as compared to the plasmid-harboring strain.
AB  - Plasmid-free acetogen Clostridium sp. MT962 electrotransformed with a small cryptic plasmid pMT351 was used to develop time- and cost-effective methods for plasmid elimination. Elimination of pMT351 restored production of acetate and ethanol to the levels of the plasmid-free strain with no dry cell weight changes. Destabilizing cell membrane via microwave at 2.45 GHz, or exposure to a single 12 ms square electric pulse at 35 kV cm(-)(1), eliminated pMT351 in 42-47 % of cells. Plasmid elimination with a single square electric pulse required 10 versus 0.1 J needed to introduce the same 3,202-bp plasmid into the cells as calculated per cell sample of Clostridium sp. MT962. Microwave caused visible changes in repPCR pattern and increased ethanol production at the expense of acetate. This is the first report on microwave of microwave ovens, wireless routers, and mobile devices causing chromosomal DNA aberrations in microbes along with carbon flux change.
TI  - Combined administration of bacteriocin-producing, probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium CCM7420 with Eleutherococcus senticosus and their effect in rabbits.
AB  - The effect of Enterococcus faecium CCM7420 (EF) - enterocin-producing and probiotic strain of rabbit origin, Eleutherococcus senticosus extract (ES) and their combination (ES+EF) was determined on selected bacteria in faeces and caecum content, leukocytes phagocytosis, blood biochemistry and growth performance. Ninety-six weaned rabbits were divided into 3 experimental (ES, EF, ES+EF) and control group (CG). The rabbits in the groups ES and EF+ES were fed commercial diet enriched with E. senticosus extract (30 g/100 kg feed), rabbits in groups EF and CG were fed untreated diet. The rabbits in the EF and ES+EF groups were administered with an overnight culture of E. faecium CCM7420 strain (500 microl/animal/day into water, 109 CFU/ml). The treatment period lasted 21 days. The microbiological examinations in faecal samples confirmed the presence of E. faecium CCM7420 strain. In groups EF and ES+EF, the reduction of faecal coliforms, Pseudomonas-like sp., Clostridium-like sp. and S. aureus was recorded. Leucocyte phagocytosis significantly increased in all experimental groups (P < 0.0001) compared to CG. The lowest GPx values were measured in the ES+EF group. Higher total protein, triglycerides and calcium concentrations were detected in experimental groups compared to CG. The cholesterol concentration decreased in the ES group. The highest average daily gain was recorded in EF group; in ES+EF the better feed conversion ratio and no mortality was recorded. These results indicated that the dietary supplementation with the E. faecium CCM7420 and E. senticosus extract stimulate the leukocytes phagocytosis and reduces the potential pathogens in rabbits digestive tract without oxidative stress and improve the growth performance.
TI  - Microbial community diversity of organically rich cassava sago factory waste waters and their ability to use nitrate and N2O added as external N-sources for enhancing biomethanation and the purification efficiency.
AB  - Water shortage necessitated South Indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the waste waters by presently about 30%. The purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide C/N ratios, around 250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. Our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (NO3(-)) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as external N-sources anticipating a better N-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants. Estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and changing CO2-, CH4-, N2O releases due to the presence of nitrate or N2O suggest that acid tolerant Lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (pH 3.5). They were very less or not found in the outflows (pH 7.3). Assumingly, the phyla Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp.), Proteobacteria (Rhizobium spp., Defluvibacter sp.), Firmicutes (Megasphaera spp., Dialister spp., Clostridium spp.) and Synergistetes (Thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. Anaerobes, about 400cellsml(-1) in the inflows, increased to about 10(6)cellsml(-1) in the outflows. The methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. In the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml(-1) denitrifying bacteria and up to 10(4)cfu fungi were found. Despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added N2O decreased considerably. Thus, wide C/N ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the N2O emissions low by using N2O either as electron acceptor or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. The biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more CO2 and the outflow samples released more CH4.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Clostridium sp. strain BNL1100, a cellulolytic mesophile isolated from corn stover.
AB  - We present the full genome sequence of Clostridium sp. strain BNL1100, a Gram-positive, endospore-forming, lignocellulolytic bacterium isolated from a corn stover enrichment culture. The 4,613,747-bp genome of strain BNL1100 contains 4,025 putative protein-coding genes, of which 103 are glycoside hydrolases, the highest detected number in cluster III clostridia.
TI  - Comparative investigation on microbial community and electricity generation in aerobic and anaerobic enriched MFCs.
AB  - This study compared the difference in microbial community and power generation capacity of air-cathode MFCs enriched under anode aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Results showed that MFCs successfully started with continuous air inputting to anode chamber. The aerobic enriched MFC produced comparable and even more electricity with the fuels of acetate, glucose and ethanol compared to the anaerobic MFC when returning to anaerobic condition. The two MFCs showed a slightly different microbial community for anode biofilms (a similarity of 77%), but a highly similar microbial community (a similarity of 97%) for anolyte microbes. The anode biofilm of aerobic enriched MFC showed the presence of some specific bacteria closely related to Clostridium sticklandii, Leucobacter komagatae and Microbacterium laevaniformans. The anaerobic enriched MFC found the presence of a large number of yeast Trichosporon sp. This research demonstrates that it is possible to enrich oxygen-tolerant anode respiring bacteria through purposely aeration in anode chamber.
TI  - Characterization of a thermostable xylanase from a newly isolated Kluyvera species and its application for biobutanol production.
AB  - Kluyvera species strain OM3 isolated from spent mushroom substrate could produce  a high level of cellulase-free xylanase (5.12 U/mL). This xylanase showed maximum activities at 70 degrees C and pH 8.0, which could retain 100% and 71% activity after 1h incubation at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C, and maintain stability over a wide range of pHs (5.0-9.0), indicating its thermal and pH stability. Moreover, the xylanase could hydrolyze untreated lignocellulosics (e.g., palm oil fiber) to reducing sugars with a yield of 27.1-46.9 mg/g. A co-culture consisting of Kluyvera sp. strain OM3 and Clostridium sp. strain BOH3 could directly convert birchwood xylan to 1.2g/L butanol, which was comparable to the amount of butanol (1.7 g/L) generated via separate hydrolysis by the xylanase and fermentation by Clostridium sp. strain BOH3. This is the first report on the production, characterization of a xylanase from genus Kluyvera and its application for butanol production directly from hemicelluloses.
TI  - Impact of temperature, CO2 fixation and nitrate reduction on selenium reduction,  by a paddy soil Clostridium strain.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the impact of CO(2) fixation, nitrate reduction and temperature on selenium reduction by a newly identified acetogenic bacterium, Clostridium sp. BXM. METHODS AND RESULTS: A series of culture experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of temperature, CO(2) fixation and nitrate reduction on the rate and extent of selenium reduction by strain BXM. The products of selenium reduction, CO(2) fixation and nitrate reduction were determined. Molecular analysis was performed to identify the functional genes involved in the selenium reduction process. CO(2) may have enhanced the activity of hydrogenase I and/or the level of cytochrome b, thus increasing selenium reduction. Nitrate may inhibit selenium reduction due to its higher reduction potential and/or by decreasing selenite/selenate reductase activity. The suitable temperature was 37 and 30 degrees C for selenite reduction under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. The optimum temperature was 30 degrees C for selenate reduction under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. CO(2) fixation and nitrate reduction by Clostridium sp. BXM stimulated each other. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium sp. BXM was capable of reducing up to 36-94% of 1 mmol l(-1) selenate and selenite under anaerobic or aerobic conditions over 15 days. The strain might be used for the precipitation of Se from highly selenium-contaminated water or sediments. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings contribute to the current understanding about the role that micro-organisms play in the detoxification of toxic selenium compounds in paddy soils. Micro-organisms in paddy soils can influence selenium accumulation in rice grain and hence human selenium intake.
TI  - Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): Acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  - In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.
TI  - Evaluation of the bioconversion of genetically modified switchgrass using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and a consolidated bioprocessing approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inherent recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the major economic hurdles for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. Additionally, lignin is recognized as having a negative impact on enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass, and as a result much interest has been placed on modifying the lignin pathway to improve bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks. RESULTS: Down-regulation of the caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in the lignin pathway yielded switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) that was more susceptible to bioconversion after dilute acid pretreatment. Here we examined the response of these plant lines to milder pretreatment conditions with yeast-based simultaneous saccharification and fermentation and a consolidated bioprocessing approach using Clostridium thermocellum, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii and Caldicellulosiruptor obsidiansis. Unlike the S. cerevisiae SSF conversions, fermentations of pretreated transgenic switchgrass with C. thermocellum showed an apparent inhibition of fermentation not observed in the wild-type switchgrass. This inhibition can be eliminated by hot water extraction of the pretreated biomass, which resulted in superior conversion yield with transgenic versus wild-type switchgrass for C. thermocellum, exceeding the yeast-based SSF yield. Further fermentation evaluation of the transgenic switchgrass indicated differential inhibition for the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains, which could not be rectified by additional processing conditions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolite profiling was used to examine the fermentation broth to elucidate the relative abundance of lignin derived aromatic compounds. The types and abundance of fermentation-derived-lignin constituents varied between C. thermocellum and each of the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of the COMT gene improves the bioconversion of switchgrass relative to the wild-type regardless of the pretreatment condition or fermentation microorganism. However, bacterial fermentations demonstrated strain-dependent sensitivity to the COMT transgenic biomass, likely due to additional soluble lignin pathway-derived constituents resulting from the COMT gene disruption. Removal of these inhibitory constituents permitted completion of fermentation by C. thermocellum, but not by the Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strains. The reason for this difference in performance is currently unknown.
TI  - [Botulinum neurotoxin--a therapy in migraine].
AB  - Although migraine is a common, paroxysmal, highly disabling disorder, the primary cause and the pathomechanism of migraine attacks are enigmatic. Experimental results suggest that activation of the trigeminovascular system is crucial in its pathogenesis. This activation leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide - CGRP, and substance P - SP) and to neurogenic inflammation, and peripheral and central sensitisation are expressed. Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A), a potent toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, affects the nervous system through specific cleavage of the soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor complex (SNARE), like synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). The result of this multistage process is blockade of the presynaptic release of pain neurotransmitters such as CGRP, SP and glutamate. A pooled analysis of the data from two programmes of Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT 1 and 2) with BoNT-A in chronic migraine demonstrated significant benefit of BoNT-A over placebo with regard to the numbers of headache days and migraine episodes. BoNT-A diminished the frequency of acute headache pain medication intake, and resulted in reductions in headache impact and improvements in scores on the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. The treatments with BoNT-A proved safe and were well tolerated.
TI  - Proliferation of diversified clostridial species during biological soil disinfestation incorporated with plant biomass under various conditions.
AB  - Biological soil disinfestation (BSD) involves the anaerobic decomposition of plant biomass by microbial communities leading to control of plant pathogens. We analyzed bacterial communities in soil of a model experiment of BSD, as affected by biomass incorporation under various conditions, to find out the major anaerobic bacterial groups which emerged after BSD treatments. The soil was treated with Brassica juncea plants, wheat bran, or Avena strigosa plants, irrigated at 20 or 30 % moisture content and incubated at 25-30 degrees C for 17 days. The population of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae incorporated at the start of the experiment declined markedly for some BSD conditions and rather high concentrations of acetate and butyrate were detected from these BSD-treated soils. The polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis based on the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the soil DNA revealed that bacterial profiles greatly changed according to the treatment conditions. Based on the clone library analysis, phylogenetically diverse clostridial species appeared exceedingly dominant in the bacterial community of BSD soil incorporated with Brassica plants or wheat bran, in which the pathogen was suppressed completely. Species in the class Clostridia such as Clostridium saccharobutylicum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium xylanovorans, Oxobacter pfennigii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium sufflavum, Clostridium cylindrosporum, etc. were commonly recognized as closely related species of the dominant clone groups from these soil samples.
TI  - Actinobacteria as essential symbionts in firebugs and cotton stainers (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae).
AB  - Actinobacteria engage in defensive symbioses with several insect taxa, but reports of nutritional contributions to their hosts have been exceptionally rare. Cotton stainers (Dysdercus fasciatus) and red firebugs (Pyrrhocoris apterus) (both Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae) harbour the actinobacterial symbionts Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter sp. as well as Firmicutes (Clostridium sp. and Lactococcus sp.) and Proteobacteria (Klebsiella sp. and a Rickettsiales bacterium) in the M3 region of their mid-gut. We combined experimental manipulation with community-level analyses to elucidate the function of the gut symbionts in both pyrrhocorid species. Elimination of symbionts by egg-surface sterilization resulted in significantly higher mortality and reduced growth rates, indicating that the microbial community plays an important role for host nutrition. Fitness of symbiont-deprived bugs could be completely restored by re-infection with the original microbiota, while reciprocal cross-infections of microbial communities across both pyrrhocorid species only partially rescued fitness, demonstrating a high degree of host-symbiont specificity. Community-level analyses by quantitative PCRs targeting the dominant bacterial strains allowed us to link the observed fitness effects to the abundance of the two actinobacterial symbionts. The nutritional mutualism with Actinobacteria may have enabled pyrrhocorid bugs to exploit Malvales seeds as a food source and thereby possibly allowed them to occupy and diversify in this ecological niche.
TI  - Characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  - Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by Aphthovirus. When FMD is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. Other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in Korea. After the FMD incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they live. This is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with DNA extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with a genomic DNA. Our results revealed that Bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. During the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, Clostridium cochlearium, Fusobacterium ulcerans, and Fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. In addition, various microbes such as Turicibacter sanguinis, Clostridium haemolyticum, Bacteroides propionicifaciens, and Comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). In particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. Therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. It is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for FMD-infected animals.
TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a butanol-acetone-producing Clostridium strain and identification of its solventogenic genes.
AB  - A unique Clostridium species strain G117 was obtained in this study to be capable of producing dominant butanol from glucose. Butanol of 13.50 g/L was produced when culture G117 was fed with 60 g/L glucose, which is ~20% higher than previously reported butanol production by wild-type Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 under similar conditions. Strain G117 also distinguishes itself by generating negligible amount of ethanol, but producing butanol and acetone as biosolvent end-products. A butanol dehydrogenase gene (bdh gene) was identified in strain G117, which demonstrated a ~200-fold increase in transcription level measured by quantitative real-time PCR after 10h of culture growth. The high transcription suggests that this bdh gene could be a putative gene involved in butanol production. In all, Clostridium sp. strain G117 serves as a potential candidate for industrial biobutanol production while the absence of ethanol ensures an economic-efficient separation and purification of butanol.
TI  - Current trends in trichloroethylene biodegradation: a review.
AB  - Over the past few years biodegradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) using different microorganisms has been investigated by several researchers. In this review article, an attempt has been made to present a critical summary of the recent results related to two major processes--reductive dechlorination and aerobic co-metabolism used for TCE biodegradation. It has been shown that mainly Clostridium sp. DC-1, KYT-1, Dehalobacter, Dehalococcoides, Desulfuromonas, Desulfitobacterium, Propionibacterium sp. HK-1, and Sulfurospirillum bacterial communities are responsible for the reductive dechlorination of TCE. Efficacy of bacterial communities like Nitrosomonas, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Xanthobacter sp. etc. for TCE biodegradation under aerobic conditions has also been examined. Mixed cultures of diazotrophs and methanotrophs have been used for TCE degradation in batch and continuous cultures (biofilter) under aerobic conditions. In addition, some fungi (Trametes versicolor, Phanerochaete chrysosporium ME-446) and Actinomycetes have also been used for aerobic biodegradation of TCE. The available information on kinetics of biofiltration of TCE and its degradation end-products such as CO2 are discussed along with the available results on the diversity of bacterial community obtained using molecular biological approaches. It has emerged that there is a need to use metabolic engineering and molecular biological tools more intensively to improve the robustness of TCE degrading microbial species and assess their diversity.
TI  - Recent changes in Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the main cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Diarrhea associated with C. difficile has increased incidence, morbidity, and mortality in the last few years. The major related risk factors include use of antibiotics, elderly patients and prolonged hospital stay. Many patients receive combinations of antibiotics or multiple antibiotics, which represents the main risk to develop diarrhea associated to C. difficile or its recurrence. Therefore, interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing, as well as compliance with infection control measures can reduce hospital-acquired C. difficile infections. This review addresses the epidemiological changes in C. difficile disease and its treatment.
TI  - Fat, oil and grease deposits in sewers: characterisation of deposits and formation mechanisms.
AB  - Fat, oil and grease deposits (FOG) in sewers are a major problem and can cause sewer overflows, resulting in environmental damage and health risks. Often simplistically portrayed as cooling of fats, recent research has suggested that saponification may be involved in FOG formation. However there are still questions about the mechanisms effecting transformations in sewers and the role and source of metal cations involved in saponification. This study characterises FOG deposits from pumping stations, sewers and sewage works from different water hardness zones across the UK. The sites all had previous problems with FOG and most catchments contained catering and food preparation establishments. The FOG deposits were highly variable with moisture content ranging from 15 to 95% and oil content from 0 to 548 mg/g. Generally the pumping stations had lower moisture content and higher fat content, followed by the sewers then the sewage works. The water in contact with the FOG had high levels of oil (mean of about 800 mg/L) and this may indicate poor kitchen FOG management practices. FOG fatty acid profiles showed a transformation from unsaturated to saturated forms compared to typical cooking oils. This seems to relate to ageing in the sewer network or the mechanism of formation, as samples from pumping stations had higher proportions of C18:1 compared to C16. This may be due to microbial transformations by bacteria such as Clostridium sp. in a similar process to adipocere formation. There was an association between water hardness and increased Ca levels in FOG along with harder deposits and higher melting points. A link between FOG properties and water hardness has not been previously reported for field samples. This may also be due to microbial processes, such as biocalcification. By developing the understanding of these mechanisms it may be possible to more effectively control FOG deposits, especially when combined with promotion of behavioural change.
TI  - Impact of protease inhibitors on dentin matrix degradation by collagenase.
AB  - This proof-of-concept study assessed whether the reduction of the degradation of  the demineralized organic matrix (DOM) by pre-treatment with protease inhibitors (PI) is effective against dentin matrix loss. Bovine dentin slices were demineralized with 0.87 M citric acid, pH 2.3, for 36 hrs. In sequence, specimens were treated or not (UT, untreated) for 1 min with gels containing epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG, 400 microM), chlorhexidine (CHX, 0.012%), FeSO(4) (1 mM), NaF (1.23%), or no active compound (P, placebo). Specimens were then stored in artificial saliva (5 days, 37 degrees C) with the addition of collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum, 100 U/mL). We analyzed collagen degradation by assaying hydroxyproline (HYP) in the incubation solutions (n = 5) and evaluated the dentin matrix loss by profilometry (n = 12). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Treatment with gels containing EGCG, CHX, or FeSO(4) led to significantly lower HYP concentrations in solution and dentin matrix loss when compared with the other treatments. These results strongly suggest that the preventive effects of the PI tested against dentin erosion are due to their ability to reduce the degradation of the DOM.
TI  - Comparative study of different Portuguese samples of propolis: pollinic, sensorial, physicochemical, microbiological characterization and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study four propolis samples from Tras-os-Montes region of Portugal. The propolis samples' color was different, which pollen analysis showed to be due to different botanical sources: Populus sp., Pinus sp., Quercus sp. and Castanea sativa. The data from physicochemical analysis (moisture, soluble and insoluble solids content, pH, conductivity, ash content, wax, total phenolics and flavonoids content) was treated using multivariate statistical tools as cluster heat map, principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis with the purpose of classifying the sample accordingly to the botanical/geographical origin. The discriminant analysis was applied with stepwise to select the variables that most contribute to sample identification accordingly to pollinic profile. The cross-validation technique was applied, using the leave-one-out procedure, which showed good prediction capabilities of the samples. Microbiologically, the commercial quality was satisfactory, since the samples didn't contain deterioration or pathogenic microorganisms. All the samples studied presented antimicrobial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in a dose dependent way. The antimicrobial activity was strictly related to the physicochemical composition. This work will allow connecting a particular chemical propolis type to a specific type of biological activity, what is essential for the use in therapeutic applications.
TI  - Myonecrosis by Clostridium septicum in a dog, diagnosed by a new multiplex-PCR.
AB  - Clostridial myositis is an acute, generally fatal toxemia that is considered to be rare in pet animals. The present report describes an unusual canine clostridial myositis that was diagnosed by a new multiplex-PCR (mPCR) designed for simultaneous identification of Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium chauvoei, and Clostridium novyi type A. A ten-month-old male Rottweiler dog, that had displayed lameness and swelling of the left limb for 12 h, was admitted to a veterinary hospital. The animal was weak, dyspneic and hyperthermic, and a clinical examination indicated the presence of gas and edema in the limb. Despite emergency treatment, the animal died in only a few minutes. Samples of muscular tissue from the necrotic area were aseptically collected and plated onto defibrinated sheep blood agar (5%) in anaerobic conditions. Colonies suggestive of Clostridium spp. were submitted to testing by multiplex-PCR. Impression smears of the tissues, visualized with Gram and also with panoptic stains, revealed long rod-shaped organisms, and specimens also tested positive using the fluorescent antibody technique (FAT). The FAT and mPCR tests enabled a diagnosis of C. septicum myonecrosis in the dog.
TI  - Cre-lox66/lox71-based elimination of phosphotransacetylase or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase shifted carbon flux in acetogen rendering selective overproduction of ethanol or acetate.
AB  - Acetogen strain Clostridium sp. MT1121 produced 300 mM acetate (p<0.005) and 321  mM ethanol (p<0.005) from synthesis gas (syngas) blend 60 % CO and 40 % H(2). Clostridium sp. MT1121 was metabolically engineered to eliminate production of either acetate or acetaldehyde during syngas fermentation. We used Cre-lox66/lox71-based gene removal system to eliminate either phosphotransacetylase (pta), or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh). The resulted biocatalyst with eliminated pta increased ethanol yield to 610 mM (p<0.005). Inactivation of pta rendered only 502 mM of ethanol (p<0.005). The acetogen biocatalyst with eliminated aldh produced 450 mM acetate (p<0.005). The role of cell energy pool preservation for re-directed carbon flux is discussed. This is the first report on time- and cost-efficient gene elimination in acetogens using lox66/lox71 gene elimination system.
TI  - Microbial communities and their performances in anaerobic hybrid sludge bed-fixed film reactor for treatment of palm oil mill effluent under various organic pollutant concentrations.
AB  - The anaerobic hybrid reactor consisting of sludge and packed zones was operated with organic pollutant loading rates from 6.2 to 8.2 g COD/L day, composed mainly of suspended solids (SS) and oil and grease (O&G) concentrations between 5.2 to 10.2 and 0.9 to 1.9 g/L, respectively. The overall process performance in terms of chemical oxygen demands (COD), SS, and O&G removals was 73, 63, and 56%, respectively. When the organic pollutant concentrations were increased, the resultant methane potentials were higher, and the methane yield increased to 0.30 L CH(4)/g COD(removed). It was observed these effects on the microbial population and activity in the sludge and packed zones. The eubacterial population and activity in the sludge zone increased to 6.4 x 10(9) copies rDNA/g VSS and 1.65 g COD/g VSS day, respectively, whereas those in the packed zone were lower. The predominant hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were Pseudomonas, Clostridium, and Bacteroidetes. In addition, the archaeal population and activity in the packed zone were increased from to 9.1 x 10(7) copies rDNA/g VSS and 0.34 g COD-CH(4)/g VSS day, respectively, whereas those in the sludge zone were not much changed. The most represented species of methanogens were the acetoclastic Methanosaeta, the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium sp., and the hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiaceae.
TI  - Testing of veterinary clostridial vaccines: from mouse to microtitre plate.
AB  - Vaccines to protect against clostridial diseases are among the most common veterinary biologicals. Each batch of these materials is subjected to a variety of toxicity and antigenicity tests. The potency of the final vaccine is then assessed by Toxin Neutralisation Test (TNT). All of these tests use mice and have lethal endpoints. Development of alternatives for potency testing was based on ELISAs able to measure antibody levels to the specific toxins relative to a standard serum with a defined unitage. These alternative assays were shown to correlate with the relevant TNTs and have been accepted by European Regulatory Authorities as batch release potency tests. Recently we have developed in vitro cell line alternatives for the toxicity and antigenicity tests for Cl. septicum using the VERO cell line. With this cell line it has been possible to develop in vitro assays which, when compared with the in vivo tests, gave correlations of 87% to 100%. Having shown proof of principle, similar cell line assays have been developed for Cl. novyi and Cl. perfringens types C and D.
TI  - Recent progress and future directions for reduction, refinement, and replacement  of animal use in veterinary vaccine potency and safety testing: a report from the 2010 NICEATM-ICCVAM International Vaccine Workshop.
AB  - Veterinary vaccines contribute to improved animal and human health and welfare by preventing infectious diseases. However, testing necessary to ensure vaccine effectiveness and safety can involve large numbers of animals and significant pain and distress. NICEATM and ICCVAM recently convened an international workshop to review the state of the science of human and veterinary vaccine potency and safety testing, and to identify priority activities to advance new and improved methods that can further reduce, refine and replace animal use. Rabies, Clostridium sp., and Leptospira sp. vaccines were identified as the highest priorities, while tests requiring live viruses and bacteria hazardous to laboratory workers, livestock, pets, and wildlife were also considered high priorities. Priority research, development and validation activities to address critical knowledge and data gaps were identified, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Enhanced international harmonization and cooperation and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers were recommended to expedite progress. Implementation of the workshop recommendations is expected to advance new methods for vaccine testing that will benefit animal welfare and ensure continued and improved protection of human and animal health.
TI  - Green-lipped mussel extract (Perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent and contentious findings from OA clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (GLM) and glucosamine. METHODS: A non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee OA. Each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole GLM extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (GS), p.o. for 12 weeks. Faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools at T (0) and T (12) weeks. Additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from changes in arthritic scores in the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Lequesne algofunctional indices and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). An intention-to-treat analysis was employed and participant data collected at T (0), T (6) and T (12) weeks. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the Wilcoxon test. In both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in Clostridium and Staphylococcus species and increase in Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Eubacterium species. In the GLM group Bifidobacterium tended to increase and Enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. The GS-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in Bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and Coliforms species, most notably Escherichia coli. We further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all OA outcome measures from T (0) to T (12) weeks for both the GLM and GS groups. The GSRS scores indicated that GIT function significantly improved over the 12 weeks duration with GLM and GS supplementation. CONCLUSION: Both GLM and GS reduced OA symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline. Changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the Clostridia sp. This study suggests that nutritional supplements such as GLM and GS may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the GIT microbiota. The decrease in Clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic Th17 and CD4+ regulatory T cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved GSRS scores and OA symptoms for these OA participants. The GIT microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.
TI  - Effects of arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) on juvenile Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) performance, immune responses and gastrointestinal microbial community.
AB  - Arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) are a newly discovered class of candidate prebiotics that exert different properties depending on their structure. In this study the effects of two different structures of AXOS, namely AXOS-32-0.30 (average degree of polymerization: 32, average degree of substitution: 0.30) and AXOS-3-0.25, were investigated on growth performance, immune responses, gut microbial fermentation and gut bacterial composition of juvenile Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). After a two weeks acclimation, fish (25.9 +/- 0.9 g) were distributed over 24 aquariums (8 replicates per treatment) and fed a control diet or a diet containing 2% AXOS-32-0.30 or AXOS-3-0.25 for 12 weeks. Growth performance and feed utilization tend to improve in sturgeon fed on diets supplemented with AXOS-32-0.30, however not significant. Survival was high in all groups. Both AXOS preparations significantly enhanced the phagocytic activity of fish macrophages compared to the control group, while the alternative haemolytic complement activity and total serum peroxidase content improved only in the group fed AXOS-32-0.30 (P < 0.05). The lysozyme activity was not affected by AXOS addition. Simultaneously, the amount of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was highest in the hind gut of sturgeon fed AXOS-32-0.30. The concentrations of acetate, butyrate and total SCFAs in fish fed AXOS-32-0.30 was significantly higher than in the groups fed the control diet or AXOS-3-0.25. Study of the bacterial community in the sturgeon hindgut using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) revealed that both preparations of AXOS induced changes in the bacterial composition. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), hindgut microbiota of each treatment group clustered apart from one another (P = 0.001). DNA sequencing of the dominant DGGE bands recovered from the different treatments showed that AXOS mainly stimulated the growth of lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium sp., with more pronounced effects of AXOS-32-0.30. It is concluded that AXOS improves sturgeon health through prebiotic action, but the induced effects depend on the specific structure of AXOS. A higher degree of polymerization of AXOS had a stronger beneficial impact in this sturgeon species.
TI  - Effect of biostimulants on 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) degradation and bacterial  community composition in contaminated aquifer sediment enrichments.
AB  - 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a toxic and persistent explosive compound occurring as a contaminant at numerous sites worldwide. Knowledge of the microbial dynamics driving TNT biodegradation is limited, particularly in native aquifer sediments where it poses a threat to water resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of organic amendments on anaerobic TNT biodegradation rate and pathway in an enrichment culture obtained from historically contaminated aquifer sediment and to compare the bacterial community dynamics. TNT readily biodegraded in all microcosms, with the highest biodegradation rate obtained under the lactate amended condition followed by ethanol amended and naturally occurring organic matter (extracted from site sediment) amended conditions. Although a reductive pathway of TNT degradation was observed across all conditions, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed distinct bacterial community compositions. In all microcosms, Gram-negative gamma- or beta-Proteobacteria and Gram-positive Negativicutes or Clostridia were observed. A Pseudomonas sp. in particular was observed to be stimulated under all conditions. According to non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of DGGE profiles, the microcosm communities were most similar to heavily TNT-contaminated field site sediment, relative to moderately and uncontaminated sediments, suggesting that TNT contamination itself is a major driver of microbial community structure. Overall these results provide a new line of evidence of the key bacteria driving TNT degradation in aquifer sediments and their dynamics in response to organic carbon amendment, supporting this approach as a promising technology for stimulating in situ TNT bioremediation in the subsurface.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of anaerobic bacteria for symbiotic recycling of uric acid nitrogen in the gut of various termites.
AB  - Recycling of the nitrogenous waste uric acid (UA) of wood-feeding termites by their gut bacteria is one of the significant aspects of symbiosis for the conservation of nitrogen sources. Diverse anaerobic UA-degrading bacteria comprising 16 species were isolated from the gut of eight termite species, and were assigned to Clostridia, Enterobacteriaceae, and low G+C Gram-positive cocci. UA-degrading Clostridia had never been isolated from termite guts. UA-degrading ability was sporadically distributed among phylogenetically various culturable anaerobic bacteria from termite guts. A strain of Clostridium sp., which was commonly isolated from three termite species and represented a probable new species in cluster XIVa of clostridia, utilized UA as a nitrogen source but not as a sole carbon and energy source. This feature is in clear contrast to that of well-studied purinolytic clostridia or previously isolated UA degraders from termite guts, which also utilize UA as a sole carbon and energy source. Ammonia is the major nitrogenous product of UA degradation. Various purines stimulated the growth of this strain when added to an otherwise growth-limiting, nitrogen poor medium. The bacterial species involved the recycling of UA nitrogen in the gut microbial community of termites are more diverse in terms of both taxonomy and nutritional physiology than previously recognized.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0174-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Bacteria: Evidence from Hot Composts by Culture-independent Analysis.
AB  - The phylogenetic diversity of the bacteria in hot composting samples collected from three spatial locations was investigated by molecular tools in order to determine the influence of gradient effect on bacterial communities during the thermophilic phase of composting swine manure with rice straw. Total microbial DNA was extracted and bacterial near full-length 16S rRNA genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, restriction fragment length polymorphism-screened and sequenced. The superstratum sample had the highest microbial diversity among the three samples which was possibly related to the surrounding conditions of the sample resulting from the location. The results showed that the sequences related to Bacillus sp. were most common in the composts. In superstratum sample, 45 clones (33%) and 36 clones (27%) were affiliated with the Bacillus sp. and Clostridium sp., respectively; 74 clones (58%) were affiliated with the Clostridium sp. in the middle-level sample; 52 clones (40%) and 29 clones (23%) were affiliated with the Clostridium sp. and Bacillus sp. in substrate sample, respectively. It indicated that the microbial diversity and community in the samples were different for each sampling site, and different locations of the same pile often contained distinct and different microbial communities.
TI  - Production of XynX, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  - XynX of Thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kDa. An Escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynX produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kDa intracellularly. The Bacillus subtilis WB700 transformant with the xynX, a strain deficient in seven proteases including Vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of 65 and 44 kDa. The B. subtilis WB800 transformant with xynX, a strain deficient in eight proteases including Vpr and WprA, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 U ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kDa, than the WB700 transformant, 6.93 U ml(-1). This indicates that the additional deletion of wprA enabled the WB800 to secrete XynX in its intact form. B. subtilis WB800 produced more total enzyme activity than E. coli (1,692 +/- 274 U vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 U), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. The results suggest the potential use of B. subtilis WB800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.
TI  - Influence of different shrinking temperatures and vacuum conditions on the ability of psychrotrophic Clostridium to cause 'blown pack' spoilage in chilled vacuum-packaged beef.
AB  - This study determined the ability of psychrotrophic Clostridium strains isolated  from vacuum-packaged beefs and abattoir environments to cause 'blown-pack' spoilage of vacuum-packaged beef stored at 2 and 15 degrees C. The influence of shrinking temperatures (83, 84 and 87 degrees C) and vacuum pressure (6 and 9 mbar) on the occurrence of such spoilage as well as the effects of simulated transportation (500 km) on the integrity of packages was determined. At 15 degrees C and 2 degrees C, twelve and six strains caused 'blown-pack' spoilage, respectively. The combination of vacuum pressure (9 mbar) combined with shrinking temperature (87 degrees C) retarded the occurrence of spoilage. The simulated transportation under the experimental conditions did not affect the integrity of packages. More studies that assess the factors that may contribute for the occurrence of 'blown-pack' spoilage should be performed to avoid the occurrence of such spoilage during its shelf-life.
TI  - The genomic basis for the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction in the bacterium Epulopiscium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epulopiscium sp. type B, a large intestinal bacterial symbiont of the surgeonfish Naso tonganus, does not reproduce by binary fission. Instead, it forms multiple intracellular offspring using a process with morphological features similar to the survival strategy of endospore formation in other Firmicutes. We hypothesize that intracellular offspring formation in Epulopiscium evolved from endospore formation and these two developmental programs share molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the observed morphological similarities. RESULTS: To test this, we sequenced the genome of Epulopiscium sp. type B to draft quality. Comparative analysis with the complete genome of its close, endospore-forming relative, Cellulosilyticum lentocellum, identified homologs of well-known sporulation genes characterized in Bacillus subtilis. Of the 147 highly conserved B. subtilis sporulation genes used in this analysis, we found 57 homologs in the Epulopiscium genome and 87 homologs in the C. lentocellum genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genes coding for components of the central regulatory network which govern the expression of forespore and mother-cell-specific sporulation genes and the machinery used for engulfment appear best conserved. Low conservation of genes expressed late in endospore formation, particularly those that confer resistance properties and encode germinant receptors, suggest that Epulopiscium has lost the ability to form a mature spore. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction.
TI  - Acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  - We used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. In addition to the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae growing on a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain CT-m2(T), which, based on 16S rDNA analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. The isolate belongs to the Clostridium cluster XIV and is most closely related to members of the Lachnospiraceae, including the genera Anaerostipes, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, Robinsoniella, Roseburia, Ruminococcus and Syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). Strain CT-m2(T) is a non-motile Gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a G + C content of DNA of 48.5 %. Cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % N(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced WCA broth. In contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is C(1)(4):(0). Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name Acetatifactor muris is proposed. The type strain is CT-m2(T) (= DSM 23669(T) = ATCC BAA-2170(T)).
TI  - Selective production of acetone during continuous synthesis gas fermentation by engineered biocatalyst Clostridium sp. MAceT113.
AB  - AIMS: To engineer acetogen biocatalyst capable of fermenting synthesis gas blend  to acetone as the only liquid carbonaceous product. METHODS AND RESULTS: The metabolic engineering comprised inactivation of phosphotransacetylase via integration of a cassette comprising synthetic genes erm(B), thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was inactivated via integration of a cassette consisting of synthetic genes cat, HMG-CoA lyase and acetoacetate decarboxylase. The engineered biocatalyst Clostridum sp. MAceT113 lost production of 253 mmol l(-1) ethanol and 296 mmol l(-1) acetate and started producing 1.8 mol l(-1) acetone in single-stage continuous syngas fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: The acetone concentration in culture broth is economical for bulk manufacture because it is about twenty times of that achieved with known acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation of sugars. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The process shows the opportunity to produce acetone from synthesis gas at concentrations comparable with production of acetone from products of petroleum cracking. This is the first report on elimination of acetate and acetaldehyde production and directing carbon flux from Acetyl-CoA to acetone via a non-naturally occurring in acetogen acetone biosynthesis pathway identified in eukaryotic organisms.
TI  - Electricity generation from cattle dung using microbial fuel cell technology during anaerobic acidogenesis and the development of microbial populations.
AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. After 30 days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220 W/m(3). The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) of the MFC reached 73.9+/-1.8% and 2.79+/-0.6%, respectively, after 120 days of operation. Acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. The PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3% and 24.2% of the sequences obtained were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas luteola and Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. The diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20 days of operation. The detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the Methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis.
TI  - A versatile method for preparation of hydrated microbial-latex biocatalytic coatings for gas absorption and gas evolution.
AB  - We describe a latex wet coalescence method for gas-phase immobilization of microorganisms on paper which does not require drying for adhesion. This method reduces drying stresses to the microbes. It is applicable for microorganisms that do not tolerate desiccation stress during latex drying even in the presence of carbohydrates. Small surface area, 10-65 mum thick coatings were generated on chromatography paper strips and placed in the head-space of vertical sealed tubes containing liquid to hydrate the paper. These gas-phase microbial coatings hydrated by liquid in the paper pore space demonstrated absorption or evolution of H(2), CO, CO(2) or O(2). The microbial products produced, ethanol and acetate, diffuse into the hydrated paper pores and accumulate in the liquid at the bottom of the tube. The paper provides hydration to the back side of the coating and also separates the biocatalyst from the products. Coating reactivity was demonstrated for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC124, which consumed CO(2) and produced 10.2 +/- 0.2 mmol O(2) m(-)(2) h(-)(1), Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009, which consumed acetate and produced 0.47 +/- 0.04 mmol H(2) m(-)(2) h(-)(1), Clostridium ljungdahlii OTA1, which consumed 6 mmol CO m(-)(2) h(-)(1), and Synechococcus sp. PCC7002, which consumed CO(2) and produced 5.00 +/- 0.25 mmol O(2) m(-)(2) h(-)(1). Coating thickness and microstructure were related to microbe size as determined by digital micrometry, profilometry, and confocal microscopy. The immobilization of different microorganisms in thin adhesive films in the gas phase demonstrates the utility of this method for evaluating genetically optimized microorganisms for gas absorption and gas evolution.
TI  - [Clostridium sp. MH18 strain induces the formation of carbonate minerals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the formation of carbonate minerals by bacteria to understand the mechanism of microbial mineralization. METHODS: Cultures of carbonate precipitation using Lagoa Vermelha medium with 6:1 molar ratio of Mg/Ca within 35 days were made under the mediation of Clostridium sp. (MH18 strain) isolated from soil. At the same time, aseptic experiments without the inoculation were done as the control. Mineral species were determined by X-ray diffraction, and the morphologies of precipitated carbonates were observed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the LV medium, MH18 strain mediated the formation of carbonate mineral, in which high-magnesium calcite was dominant. In the initial stage, the minerals had shapes with dumbbell-like morphology, and finally transformed to spheres. Only a small amount of precipitation appeared in the control, but X-ray diffraction patterns showed that these precipitations were amorphous substance. CONCLUSIONS: MH18 strain could induce crystallization of carbonate.
TI  - Microbiota benefits after inulin and partially hydrolized guar gum supplementation: a randomized clinical trial in constipated women.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prebiotics positively affect gut microbiota composition, thus improving gut function. These properties may be useful for the treatment of constipation. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the tolerance and effectiveness of a prebiotic inulin/partially hydrolyzed guar gum mixture (I-PHGG) for the treatment of constipation in females, as well as its influence on the composition of intestinal microbiota and production of short chain fatty acids. METHODS: Our study enrolled 60 constipated female health worker volunteers. Participants reported less than 3 bowel movements per week. Volunteers were randomized to treatment with prebiotic or placebo. Treatment consisted of 3 weeks supplementation with 15 g/d IPHGG (fiber group) or maltodextrin (placebo group). Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, stool consistency, and bowel movements were evaluated by a recorded daily questionnaire and a weekly interview. Changes in fecal bacterial population and short chain fatty acids were assessed by real-time PCR and gas chromatography, respectively. RESULTS: There was an increased frequency of weekly bowel movements and patient satisfaction in both the fiber and placebo groups with no significant differences. Total Clostridium sp significantly decreased in the fiber group (p = 0.046) and increased in the placebo group (p = 0.047). There were no changes in fecal short chain fatty acid profile. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of I-PHGG produced clinical results comparable to placebo in constipated females, but had additional protective effects on gut microbiota by decreasing the amount of pathological bacteria of the Clostridium genera.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Elimination of acetate production to improve ethanol yield during continuous synthesis gas fermentation by engineered biocatalyst Clostridium sp. MTEtOH550.
AB  - Acetogen strain Clostridum sp. MT653 produced acetate 273 mM (p < 0.005) and ethanol 250 mM (p < 0.005) from synthesis gas blend mixture of 64% CO and 36% H(2). Clostridum sp. MT653 was metabolically engineered to the biocatalyst strain Clostridium sp. MTEtOH550. The biocatalyst increased ethanol yield to 590 mM with no acetate production during single-stage continuous syngas fermentation due to expression of synthetic adh cloned in a multi-copy number expression vector. The acetate production was eliminated by inactivation of the pta gene in Clostridium sp. MTEtOH550. Gene introduction and gene elimination were achieved only using Syngas Biofuels Energy, Inc. electroporation generator. The electrotransformation efficiencies were 8.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) per microgram of transforming DNA of the expression vector at cell viability ~15%. The frequency of suicidal vector integration to inactivate pta was ~10(-5) per the number of recipient cells. This is the first report on elimination of acetate production and overexpression of synthetic adh gene to engineer acetogen biocatalyst for selective biofuel ethanol production during continuous syngas fermentation.
TI  - Effects of 1,1,1-trichloroethane on enzymatic activity and bacterial community in anaerobic microcosm form sequencing batch reactors.
AB  - 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), a major organic and groundwater contaminant, has very strong toxic effects on humans, plants and microorganisms. Effects of TCA on enzymatic activity and microbial diversity were investigated in the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) under methanogenic, nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing and benzene/toluene degrading conditions. The activities of three enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphatase and protease) were significantly decreased in the presence of 5 mg/L TCA. Within these three affected enzymes, phosphatase activity may serve as a noteworthy marker of bacterial toxicity. The activity of phosphatase was 0.2 U/L in methanogenic conditions with 5 mg/L TCA, which was 99% lower than the controls, and the enzyme activity was 18.6 U/L in methanogenic conditions with 1 mg/L TCA, which was 7% lower than the controls. DGGE profiles showed that TCA altered the bacterial community distribution and diversity obviously during the 21 day of TCA exposure. The enzyme activities decreased second lowest but TCA degrading strains Clostridium sp. DhR-2/LM-G01, Bacterial clone DCE25 and Bacterial clone DPHB06 were enriched in the methanogenic ASBR amended TCA.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of tile drainage water and shallow groundwater under different application methods of liquid swine manure.
AB  - A 2 year field experiment evaluated liquid manure application methods on the movement of manure-borne pathogens (Salmonella sp.) and indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) to subsurface water. A combination of application methods including surface application, pre-application tillage, and post-application incorporation were applied in a randomized complete block design on an instrumented field site in spring 2007 and 2008. Tile and shallow groundwater were sampled immediately after manure application and after rainfall events. Bacterial enumeration from water samples showed that the surface-applied manure resulted in the highest concentration of E. coli in tile drainage water. Pre-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the movement of manure-based E. coli and C. perfringens to tile water and to shallow groundwater within 3 days after manure application (DAM) in 2008 and within 10 DAM in 2007. Pre-tillage also decreased the occurrence of Salmonella sp. in tile water samples. Indicator bacteria and pathogens reached nondetectable levels within 50 DAM. The results suggest that tillage before application of liquid swine manure can minimize the movement of bacteria to tile and groundwater, but is effective only for the drainage events immediately after manure application or initial rainfall-associated drainage flows. Furthermore, the study highlights the strong association between bacterial concentrations in subsurface waters and rainfall timing and volume after manure application.
TI  - The antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low molar mass chitosans  (LMWC) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (CS) hydrolysates. Here, we show the in vitro effect of different COS, LMWC, and CS on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary CS products by humans. Specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Roseburia intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% COS (2, 3, and 6 kDa), 0.025 and 0.05% of LMWC (10 and 16 kDa), and 0.025 and 0.1% of CS in vitro. The growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of COS and LMWC in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. A relatively higher resistance to CS hydrolyzates was detected in R. intestinalis and F. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to Bacteoides sp. and Clostridium sp. The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (DP). MIC ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and DP of CS/LMWC. MBC also decreased with DP. The most effective antimicrobial action was detected in LMWC with 16 kDa and CS. Weak antimicrobial activity was found in COS with small molecules (2 and 3 kDa).
TI  - Bostrycin, a novel coupling agent for protein immobilization and prevention of biomaterial-centered infection produced by Nigrospora sp. No. 407.
AB  - Bostrycin, a red antibacterial agent with tetrahydroanthraquinone structure, has  been isolated from Nigrospora sp. No. 407. This study investigated the potential antibacterial and multifunctional properties of matrixes through immobilization of bostrycin on their surface for immobilization of protein and prevention of bacterial growth. Bostrycin was immobilized on nonwoven polypropylene (PP) fabric by a technique using glutaraldehyde and polyethyleneimine for the activation of the surface. Glucose oxidase immobilized on bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric showed high activity. The immobilization process improved thermal stability of the enzymes. During repeated assay for 30 cycles, the enzyme activity dropped to only 70% of the initial activity. Both bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric sample and subsequently immobilized glucose oxidase sample on the surface also still exhibited a bacteriostatic effect. This is the first study to show that bostrycin is a promising coupling agent for surface modification on matrix and its potential applications in protein immobilization and biomaterial-centered infection.
TI  - Production of biofuels from pretreated microalgae biomass by anaerobic fermentation with immobilized Clostridium acetobutylicum cells.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the possible use of pretreated biomass of various microalgae and cyanobacteria as substrates for acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum cells immobilized into poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel. To this end, the biochemical composition of photosynthetic microorganisms cultivated under various conditions was studied. The most efficient technique for pretreating microalgal biomass for its subsequent conversion into biofuels appeared to be thermal decomposition at 108 degrees C. For the first time the maximum productivity of the ABE fermentation in terms of hydrogen (8.5 mmol/L medium/day) was obtained using pretreated biomass of Nannochloropsis sp. Maximum yields of butanol and ethanol were observed with Arthrospira platensis biomass used as the substrate. Immobilized Clostridium cells were demonstrated to be suitable for multiple reuses (for a minimum of five cycles) in ABE fermentation for producing biofuels from pretreated microalgal biomass.
TI  - Implications of volatile fatty acid profile on the metabolic pathway during continuous sulfate reduction.
AB  - Volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile is an important parameter in anaerobic reactors because it enables the assessment of metabolic pathways. Volatile fatty acids were monitored during sulfate reduction in a UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactor treating 2g/L sulfate concentration and with the organic loading increasing from 3.5 kg COD/m(3)d to 5.9 kg COD/m(3)d, for a 1-day residence time. In the absence of recirculation, the best outcome (65% reduction) was noticed with the lowest organic loading (3.55 kg/m(3)d). When recirculation was applied, sulfate reduction yields increased to 89%, corresponding to a sulfate removal rate of 1.94 kg SO(4)(2-)/m(3)d. The reactor performance was discussed in relation to microbial diversity and metabolic pathways. At high organic loading, two metabolic pathways account for lactate degradation: (i) lactate is oxidized to acetate and carbon dioxide by the incomplete-oxidizer SRB (sulfate-reducing bacteria) Desulfomonas, Desulfovibrio, Desulfolobus, Desulfobulbus and Desulfotomaculum spp.; (ii) lactate is converted to acetate by fermenting bacteria such as Clostridium sp. High propionate concentrations imply that there are low sulfate reduction efficiencies.
TI  - Microbial degradation of 4-monobrominated diphenyl ether with anaerobic sludge.
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant additives  for many plastic and electronic products. Owing to their ubiquitous distribution in the environment, multiple toxicity to humans, and increasing accumulation in the environment, the fate of PBDEs is of serious concern for public safety. In this study, the degradation of 4-monobrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-3) in anaerobic sludge and the effect of carbon source addition were investigated. BDE-3 can be degraded by two different anaerobic sludge samples. The by-products, diphenyl ether (DE) and bromide ions, were monitored, indicating the reaction of debromination within these anaerobic samples. Co-metabolism with glucose facilitated BDE-3 biodegradation in terms of kinetics and efficiency in the Jhongsing sludge. Through the pattern of amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments in denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), the composition of the microbial community was analyzed. Most of the predominant microbes were novel species. The fragments enriched in BDE-3-degrading anaerobic sludge samples are presumably Clostridium sp. This enrichment coincides with the H(2) gas generation and the facilitation of debromination during the degradation process. Findings of this study provide better understanding of the biodegradation of brominated DEs and can facilitate the prediction of the fate of PBDEs in the environment.
TI  - Establishment of the bacterial fecal community during the first month of life in  Brazilian newborns.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The establishment of the intestinal microbiota in newborns is a critical period with possible long-term consequences for human health. In this research, the development of the fecal microbiota of a group of exclusively breastfed neonates living in low socio-economic conditions in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, during the first month of life, was studied. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from ten neonates on the second, seventh, and 30(th) days after birth. One of the neonates underwent antibiotic therapy. Molecular techniques were used for analysis; DNA was extracted from the samples, and 16S rRNA libraries were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed after construction. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the samples taken from the 30(th) day to amplify DNA from Bifidobacterium sp. RESULTS: The primary phylogenetic groups identified in the samples were Escherichia and Clostridium. Staphylococcus was identified at a low rate. Bifidobacterium sp. was detected in all of the samples collected on the 30(th) day. In the child who received antibiotics, a reduction in anaerobes and Escherichia, which was associated with an overgrowth of Klebsiella, was observed throughout the experimental period. CONCLUSION: The observed pattern of Escherichia predominance and reduced Staphylococcus colonization is in contrast with the patterns observed in neonates living in developed countries.
TI  - Clostridia in premature neonates' gut: incidence, antibiotic susceptibility, and  perinatal determinants influencing colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although premature neonates (PN) gut microbiota has been studied, data about gut clostridial colonization in PN are scarce. Few studies have reported clostridia colonization in PN whereas Bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. Such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. Besides, PN are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to report the distribution of Clostridium species isolated in feces from PN and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 76 PN followed until hospital discharge in three French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 79% were colonized by clostridia. Clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. Antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except C. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. However, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10 days) antibiotic courses (p = 0.006 and p = 0.001, respectively). Besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the NICU (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: This study shows that clostridia are part of the PN gut microbiota. It provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in PN showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules. Thus, the high prevalence of this genus is not linked to a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents or to the use of antibiotics in NICUs. The main perinatal determinant influencing PN clostridia colonization appears to be the NICU environment.
TI  - Effect of exogenous electron shuttles on growth and fermentative metabolism in Clostridium sp. BC1.
AB  - In this study, the influence exogenous electron shuttles on the growth and glucose fermentative metabolism of Clostridium sp. BC1 was investigated. Bicarbonate addition to mineral salts (MS) medium accelerated growth and glucose fermentation which shifted acidogenesis (acetic- and butyric-acids) towards solventogenesis (ethanol and butanol). Addition of ferrihydrite, anthraquinone disulfonate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in bicarbonate to growing culture showed no significant influence on fermentative metabolism. In contrast, methyl viologen (MV) enhanced ethanol- and butanol-production by 28- and 12-fold, respectively with concomitant decrease in hydrogen, acetic- and butyric-acids compared to MS medium. The results show that MV addition affects hydrogenase activity with a significant reduction in hydrogen production and a shift in the direction of electron flow towards enhanced production of ethanol and butanol.
TI  - The human small intestinal microbiota is driven by rapid uptake and conversion of simple carbohydrates.
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) harbors a complex community of microbes. The microbiota composition varies between different locations in the GI tract, but most studies focus on the fecal microbiota, and that inhabiting the colonic mucosa. Consequently, little is known about the microbiota at other parts of the GI tract, which is especially true for the small intestine because of its limited accessibility. Here we deduce an ecological model of the microbiota composition and function in the small intestine, using complementing culture-independent approaches. Phylogenetic microarray analyses demonstrated that microbiota compositions that are typically found in effluent samples from ileostomists (subjects without a colon) can also be encountered in the small intestine of healthy individuals. Phylogenetic mapping of small intestinal metagenome of three different ileostomy effluent samples from a single individual indicated that Streptococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp. and high G+C organisms are most abundant in the small intestine. The compositions of these populations fluctuated in time and correlated to the short-chain fatty acids profiles that were determined in parallel. Comparative functional analysis with fecal metagenomes identified functions that are overrepresented in the small intestine, including simple carbohydrate transport phosphotransferase systems (PTS), central metabolism and biotin production. Moreover, metatranscriptome analysis supported high level in-situ expression of PTS and carbohydrate metabolic genes, especially those belonging to Streptococcus sp. Overall, our findings suggest that rapid uptake and fermentation of available carbohydrates contribute to maintaining the microbiota in the human small intestine.
TI  - Dechlorination of p,p'-DDTs coupled with sulfate reduction by novel sulfate-reducing bacterium Clostridium sp. BXM.
AB  - A novel non-dsrAB (without dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes) sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Clostridium sp. BXM was isolated from a paddy soil. Incubation experiments were then performed to investigate the formation of reduced sulfur compounds (RSC) by Clostridium sp. BXM, and RSC-induced dechlorination of p,p'-DDT in culture medium and soil solution. The RSCs produced were 5.8 mM and 4.5 mM in 28 mM sulfate amended medium and soil solution respectively after 28-day cultivation. The p,p'-DDT dechlorination ratios were 74% and 45.8% for 5.8mM and 4.5 mM RSCs respectively at 6h. The metabolites of p,p'-DDT found in the two reaction systems were identified as p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE. The dechlorination pathways of p,p'-DDT to p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE were proposed, based on mass balance and dechlorination time-courses. The results indicated that RSC-induced natural dechlorination may play an important role in the fate of organochlorines.
TI  - Comparison of methods for the enumeration of Clostridium perfringens spores in water.
AB  - Four methods for enumerating Clostridium perfringens spores in water were evaluated: (1) the IMM (Iron Milk Medium) method (MPN); (2) the LS (Lactose Sulfite Broth) method (MPN); (3) the m-CP (membrane filtration Clostridium perfringens Agar) method (membrane filtration); and (4) the TSC (Tryptose Sulfite Cycloserine Agar) method (membrane filtration). The performance of these methods was compared with that of the DRCM (Differential Reinforced Clostridium Medium) method (MPN) as adopted by CETESB (Brazil's Environmental Sanitation Technology Company) for the analysis of C. perfringens spores in water. Statistical analysis was performed according to ISO 17994:2004 (Water Quality - Criteria for Establishing Equivalence between Microbiological Methods). The LS, m-CP, and TSC methods were considered not equivalent to the DRCM method, as they gave significantly lower results. The IMM showed inconclusive results and, according to ISO 17994:2004, analysis of a greater number of samples is needed to draw definitive conclusions comparing IMM and DRCM.
TI  - Characteristics of spoilage-associated secondary cucumber fermentation.
AB  - Secondary fermentations during the bulk storage of fermented cucumbers can result in spoilage that causes a total loss of the fermented product, at an estimated cost of $6,000 to $15,000 per affected tank. Previous research has suggested that such fermentations are the result of microbiological utilization of lactic acid and the formation of acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. The objectives of this study were to characterize the chemical and environmental conditions associated with secondary cucumber fermentations and to isolate and characterize potential causative microorganisms. Both commercial spoilage samples and laboratory-reproduced secondary fermentations were evaluated. Potential causative agents were isolated based on morphological characteristics. Two yeasts, Pichia manshurica and Issatchenkia occidentalis, were identified and detected most commonly concomitantly with lactic acid utilization. In the presence of oxygen, yeast metabolic activities lead to lactic acid degradation, a small decline in the redox potential (E(h), Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl) of the fermentation brines, and an increase in pH to levels at which bacteria other than the lactic acid bacteria responsible for the primary fermentation can grow and produce acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. Inhibition of these yeasts by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) resulted in stabilization of the fermented medium, while the absence of the preservative resulted in the disappearance of lactic and acetic acids in a model system. Additionally, three Gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus buchneri, a Clostridium sp., and Pediococcus ethanolidurans, were identified as potentially relevant to different stages of the secondary fermentation. The unique opportunity to study commercial spoilage samples generated a better understanding of the microbiota and environmental conditions associated with secondary cucumber fermentations.
TI  - Solar hydrogen-producing bionanodevice outperforms natural photosynthesis.
AB  - Although a number of solar biohydrogen systems employing photosystem I (PSI) have been developed, few attain the electron transfer throughput of oxygenic photosynthesis. We have optimized a biological/organic nanoconstruct that directly tethers F(B), the terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster of PSI from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, to the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase (H(2)ase) from Clostridium acetobutylicum. On illumination, the PSI-[FeFe]-H(2)ase nanoconstruct evolves H(2) at a rate of 2,200 +/- 460 mumol mg chlorophyll(-1) h(-1), which is equivalent to 105 +/- 22 e(-)PSI(-1) s(-1). Cyanobacteria evolve O(2) at a rate of approximately 400 mumol mg chlorophyll(-1) h(-1), which is equivalent to 47 e(-)PSI(-1) s(-1), given a PSI to photosystem II ratio of 1.8. The greater than twofold electron throughput by this hybrid biological/organic nanoconstruct over in vivo oxygenic photosynthesis validates the concept of tethering proteins through their redox cofactors to overcome diffusion-based rate limitations on electron transfer.
TI  - Effects of initial lactic acid concentration, HRTs, and OLRs on bio-hydrogen production from lactate-type fermentation.
AB  - A batch test and continuous operation were performed to identify the effect of lactate on hydrogen production at pH 4.5. When the initial lactic acid concentration was increased from 0 to 8 g/L in the batch test, the hydrogen yield also increased from 1.41 to 1.72 mol-H2/mol-glucose. The system exhibited a long lag time and an insignificant hydrogen yield with 16 g-lactic acid/L. A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was operated at different organic loading rates (OLRs: 10, 15, 20 and 40 g/L/day) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs: 6, 12 and 24 h). At an OLR of 20 g-glucose/L/day and 12 h of HRT, the hydrogen yield was 1.2 mol-H2/mol-glucose. The yield decreased with a 24 h HRT. Even though lactate was one of the major constituents of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), hydrogen production was feasible throughout the operation. Clostridium sp. was the dominant hydrogen-producing bacteria in the system.
TI  - Old beagle dogs have lower faecal concentrations of some fermentation products and lower peripheral lymphocyte counts than young adult beagles.
AB  - The effects of age on microbiota composition, gut fermentation end-product formation and peripheral lymphocyte numbers were compared between old and young adult Beagle dogs fed four kibble diets differing in yeast cell wall contents. The experiment had a double 4 x 4 Latin square design, one with four mature dogs (4 years old) and the other with four old dogs (10 years old), with four replicates (diets) per dog. In each period a 15 d adaptation period preceded a 5 d total collection of faeces for the digestibility trial. On day 21, fresh faecal samples were collected for the determination of bacterial enumeration, pH, biogenic amine and short-chain fatty acid. Flow cytometry was used for immunophenotypic evaluation. Dogs were fed four kibble diets with similar composition with 0, 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 % of yeast cell wall (as-fed), respectively. Data were evaluated using general linear models of Statistical Analysis Systems statistical software (P < 0.05). No evidence of a difference in faecal bacteria counts between ages was found (total aerobes, total anaerobes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium and Escherichia coli: P>0.15). Faecal concentrations of butyrate, histamine, agmatine and spermine were lower (P </= 0.05) and faecal pH was higher (P = 0.03) in older dogs than in mature adult dogs, suggesting an alteration in bacterial metabolic activity, or in the rate of intestinal absorption of these compounds. Concentrations of T-lymphocytes, T-cytotoxic lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes were also lower (P </= 0.01) in older dogs than in mature adult dogs. The study confirmed alterations in peripheral lymphocytes and revealed a reduced concentration of some fermentation end products in the colon of old dogs.
TI  - Culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community structure from the intestinal tracts of earthworms(Eisenia fetida).
AB  - The bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were investigated by culture-dependent and - independent approaches. In total, 72 and 55 pure cultures were isolated from the intestinal tracts of earthworms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Aerobic bacteria were classified as Aeromonas (40%), Bacillus (37%), Photobacterium (10%), Pseudomonas (7%), and Shewanella (6%). Anaerobic bacteria were classified as Aeromonas (52%), Bacillus (27%), Shewanella (12%), Paenibacillus (5%), Clostridium (2%), and Cellulosimicrobium (2%). The dominant microorganisms were Aeromonas and Bacillus species under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In all, 39 DNA fragments were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis. Aeromonas sp. was the dominant microorganism in feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms. The DGGE band intensity of Aeromonas from feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms was 12.8%, 14.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. The other strains identified were Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Photobacterium, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Streptomyces, uncultured Chloroflexi bacterium, and uncultured bacterium. These results suggest that PCR-DGGE analysis was more efficient than the culture-dependent approach for the investigation of bacterial diversity and the identification of unculturable microorganisms.
TI  - Effects of stimulation of copper bioleaching on microbial community in vineyard soil and copper mining waste.
AB  - Long-term copper application in vineyards and copper mining activities cause heavy metal pollution sites. Such sites need remediation to protect soil and water quality. Bioremediation of contaminated areas through bioleaching can help to remove copper ions from the contaminated soils. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different treatments for copper bioleaching in two diverse copper-contaminated soils (a 40-year-old vineyard and a copper mining waste) and to evaluate the effect on microbial community by applying denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S ribosomal DNA amplicons and DNA sequence analysis. Several treatments with HCl, H(2)SO(4), and FeSO(4) were evaluated by stimulation of bioleaching of copper in the soils. Treatments and extractions using FeSO(4) and H(2)SO(4) mixture at 30 degrees C displayed more copper leaching than extractions with deionized water at room temperature. Treatment with H(2)SO(4) supported bioleaching of as much as 120 mg kg(-1) of copper from vineyard soil after 115 days of incubation. DGGE analysis of the treatments revealed that some treatments caused greater diversity of microorganisms in the vineyard soil compared to the copper mining waste. Nucleotide Blast of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA gene bands from DGGE indicated the presence of Rhodobacter sp., Silicibacter sp., Bacillus sp., Paracoccus sp., Pediococcus sp., a Myxococcales, Clostridium sp., Thiomonas sp., a firmicute, Caulobacter vibrioides, Serratia sp., and an actinomycetales in vineyard soil. Contrarily, Sphingomonas was the predominant genus in copper mining waste in most treatments. Paracoccus sp. and Enterobacter sp. were also identified from DGGE bands of the copper mining waste. Paracoccus species is involved in the copper bioleaching by sulfur oxidation system, liberating the copper bounded in the soils and hence promoting copper bioremediation. Results indicate that stimulation of bioleaching with a combination of FeSO(4) and H(2)SO(4) promoted bioleaching in the soils and can be employed ex situ to remediate copper-impacted soils.
TI  - Caloramator boliviensis sp. nov., a thermophilic, ethanol-producing bacterium isolated from a hot spring.
AB  - A novel moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, ethanol-producing bacterial strain, 45B(T), was isolated from a mixed sediment water sample collected from a hot spring at Potosi, Bolivia. The cells were straight to slightly curved rods approximately 2.5 microm long and 0.5 microm wide. The strain was Gram-stain-variable, spore-forming and monotrichously flagellated. Growth of the strain was observed at 45-65 degrees C and pH 5.5-8.0, with optima of 60 degrees C and pH 6.5. The substrates utilized by strain 45B(T) were xylose, cellobiose, glucose, arabinose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, fructose, galactose, mannose, glycerol, xylan, carboxymethylcellulose and yeast extract. The main fermentation product from xylose and cellobiose was ethanol (0.70 and 0.45 g ethanol per gram of consumed sugar, respectively). Acetate, lactate, propionate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were also produced in minor quantities. 1,3-Propanediol was produced when glycerol-containing medium was supplemented with yeast extract. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), C(16:0), iso-C(16:0), C(15:1), iso-C(14:0), C(13:0) and C(14:0). The polar lipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an aminoglycolipid and 15 other unidentified lipids were predominant. The DNA G+C content of strain 45B(T) was 32.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity revealed that strain 45B(T) is located within the Gram-type positive Bacillus-Clostridium branch of the phylogenetic tree. On the basis of morphological and physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis, strain 45B(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Caloramator boliviensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 45B(T) (=DSM 22065(T)=CCUG 57396(T)).
TI  - Improved ethanol production from various carbohydrates through anaerobic thermophilic co-culture.
AB  - Saccharification is one of the most critical steps in producing lignocellulose-based bio-ethanol through consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). However, extreme pH and ethanol concentration are commonly considered as potential inhibitors for the application of Clostridium sp. in CBP. The fermentations of several saccharides derived from lignocellulosics were investigated with a co-culture consisting of Clostridium themocellum and Clostridium thermolacticum. Alkali environments proved to be more favorable for ethanol production. Fermentation inhibition was observed at high ethanol concentrations and extreme pH. However, low levels of initial ethanol addition resulted in an unexpected stimulatory impact on the final ethanol productions for all cultures under selected conditions. The co-culture was able to actively ferment glucose, xylose, cellulose and micro-crystallized cellulose (MCC). The ethanol yield observed in the co-culture was higher (up to twofold) than in mono-cultures, especially in MCC fermentation. The highest ethanol yield (as a percentage of the theoretical maximum) observed was 75% (w/w) for MCC and 90% (w/w) for xylose.
TI  - Using temperature and time criteria to control the effectiveness of continuous thermal sanitation of piggery effluent in terms of set microbial indicators.
AB  - AIM: To determine the minimal conditions (temperature-time), necessary to achieve set sanitation targets for selected microbial indicators during the continuous thermal treatment of pig slurry. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effectiveness of thermal treatment between 55 and 96 degrees C was studied using Escherichia coli, enterococci, sulfite-reducing Clostridia (SRC), mesophilic culturable bacteria (MCB), F+-specific and somatic phages. Identification of SRC and MCB was performed using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Ten minutes at 70 degrees C or 1 h at 60 degrees C was sufficient to reduce the vegetative bacteria by 4-5 log(10), but it had little effect on somatic phages nor on spore formers, dominated by Clostridium sp. At 96 degrees C, somatic phages were still detected, but there was a reduction of 3.1 log(10) for SRC and of 1.4 log(10) for MCB. At 96 degrees C, Clostridium botulinum was identified among the thermotolerant MCB. CONCLUSION: Only those hygienic risks relating to mesophilic vegetative bacteria can be totally eliminated from pig slurry treated at 60 degrees C (60 min) or 70 degrees C (<10 min). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Hygiene standards based on the removal of the indicators E. coli and enterococci can easily be met by treatment as low as 60 degrees C (enabling, a low-cost treatment using heat recovery). However, even at 96 degrees C, certain pathogens may persist.
TI  - Microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  - It is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. Pyrosequencing targeting the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and Bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. Diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and Bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. The Bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. Clustering and Venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and Bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. Traditional fecal indicators, i.e., Escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and Clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. Besides the Bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., Parasutterella excrementihominis, Veillonella sp., Dialister invisus, Megamonas funiformis, and Ruminococcus lactaris for the human and Lactobacillus amylovorus and Atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. These microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent on the absence or presence of a single indicator. Monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.
TI  - Functional insight into the C-terminal extension of halolysin SptA from haloarchaeon Natrinema sp. J7.
AB  - Halolysin SptA from haloarchaeon Natrinema sp. J7 consists of a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and a C-terminal extension (CTE) containing two cysteine residues. In this report, we have investigated the function of the CTE using recombinant enzymes expressed in Haloferax volcanii WFD11. Deletion of the CTE greatly reduced but did not abolish protease activity, which suggests that the CTE is not essential for enzyme folding. Mutational analysis suggests that residues Cys303 and Cys338 within the CTE form a disulfide bond that make this domain resistant to autocleavage and proteolysis under hypotonic conditions. Characterization of full-length and CTE-truncation enzymes indicates the CTE not only confers extra stability to the enzyme but also assists enzyme activity on protein substrates by facilitating binding at high salinities. Interestingly, homology modeling of the CTE yields a beta-jelly roll-like structure similar to those seen in Claudin-binding domain of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (clostridial C-CPE) and collagen binding domain (CBD), and the CTE also possesses collagen-binding activity, making it a potential candidate as an anchoring unit in drug delivery systems.
TI  - pH in the bacteria-contaminated wound and its impact on clostridium histolyticum  collagenase activity: implications for the use of collagenase wound debridement agents.
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to understand the influence of pH on Clostridium collagenase activity, using both in vitro and in vivo, and to understand the influence of bacterial contamination on pH in vivo. DESIGN: Artificial wound eschar was used for the assessment of debridement efficacy in vitro and the wound fluid of a contaminated pig wound model was used for examining pH during healing using in vivo techniques. METHODS: We used a collagen-based artificial wound eschar to test collagenase activity in the collagenase product under various pH conditions. We evaluated bacterial contaminated wounds, using a pig wound model with a bacterial load including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Fusobacterium sp to track the pH of wounds in relation to bacterial load. RESULTS: The pH levels in the wound fluid were all above neutral. They varied from 9.2 on day 1 to 8.3 on day 10. Collagenase achieved its highest activity around a pH of 8.5 when tested in Tris-buffered saline. Using artificial wound eschar, the optimal pH range for C collagenase was determined to be more than a pH of 6. The total initial microbial load (day 0) was higher than levels at any other time during the study. The levels of P aeruginosa began to decrease on day 1, but by day 4 the total pseudomonas population had rebounded to near day 0 levels. This was followed by a distinct decrease and by day 21 levels were lower than those on day 0. The coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) population behaved differently than the pseudomonas population, decreasing and remaining decreased relative to day 0 through day 14. However, by day 21 the CNS population had increased to near day 0 levels. This greatly influenced the increase in total bioburden by day 21, indicating that it was primarily due to the increase in CNS. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that wound pH in a model of contaminated pig wounds is alkaline during the first 10 days of healing. As healing progresses, pH decreases with no significant change in the level of bacterial bioburden. C collagenase exhibited robust activity in the pH range found in this contaminated pig wound model, suggesting it can effectively debride necrotic tissue in the environment found in most chronic wounds in humans.
TI  - Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates containing 2-hydroxybutyrate from unrelated carbon source by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have previously reported in vivo biosynthesis of polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] employing metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains by the introduction of evolved Clostridium propionicum propionyl-CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)). Using this in vivo PLA biosynthesis system, we presently report the biosynthesis of PHAs containing 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB) monomer by direct fermentation of a metabolically engineered E. coli strain. The recombinant E. coli ldhA mutant XLdh strain expressing PhaC1( Ps6-19) and Pct(Cp) was developed and cultured in a chemically defined medium containing 20 g/L of glucose and varying concentrations of 2HB and 3HB. PHAs consisting of 2HB, 3HB, and a small fraction of lactate were synthesized. Their monomer compositions were dependent on the concentrations of 2HB and 3HB added to the culture medium. Even though the ldhA gene was completely deleted in the chromosome of E. coli, up to 6 mol% of lactate was found to be incorporated into the polymer depending on the culture condition. In order to synthesize PHAs containing 2HB monomer without feeding 2HB into the culture medium, a heterologous metabolic pathway for the generation of 2HB from glucose was constructed via the citramalate pathway, in which 2-ketobutyrate is synthesized directly from pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Introduction of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis Il1403 2HB dehydrogenase gene (panE) into E. coli allowed in vivo conversion of 2-ketobutyrate to 2HB. The metabolically engineered E. coli XLdh strain expressing the phaC1437, pct540, cimA3.7, and leuBCD genes together with the L. lactis Il1403 panE gene successfully produced PHAs consisting of 2HB, 3HB, and a small fraction of lactate by varying the 3HB concentration in the culture medium. As the 3HB concentration in the medium increased the 3HB monomer fraction in the polymer, the polymer content increased. When Ralstonia eutropha phaAB genes were additionally expressed in this recombinant E. coli XLdh strain, P(2HB-co-3HB-co-LA) having small amounts of 2HB and LA monomers could also be produced from glucose as a sole carbon source. The metabolic engineering strategy reported here should be useful for the production of PHAs containing 2HB monomer.
TI  - Genetic diversity and amplification of different clostridial [FeFe] hydrogenases  by group-specific degenerate primers.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore and characterize the genetic diversity of [FeFe] hydrogenases in a representative set of strains from Clostridium sp. and to reveal the existence of neither yet detected nor characterized [FeFe] hydrogenases in hydrogen-producing strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: The genomes of 57 Clostridium strains (34 different genotypic species), representing six phylogenetic clusters based on their 16S rRNA sequence analysis (cluster I, III, XIa, XIb, XIV and XVIII), were screened for different [FeFe] hydrogenases. Based on the obtained alignments, ten pairs of [FeFe] hydrogenase cluster-specific degenerate primers were newly designed. Ten Clostridium strains were screened by PCRs to assess the specificity of the primers designed and to examine the genetic diversity of [FeFe] hydrogenases. Using this approach, a diversity of hydrogenase genes was discovered in several species previously shown to produce hydrogen in bioreactors: Clostridium sartagoforme, Clostridium felsineum, Clostridium roseum and Clostridium pasteurianum. CONCLUSIONS: The newly designed [FeFe] hydrogenase cluster-specific primers, targeting the cluster-conserved regions, allow for a direct amplification of a specific hydrogenase gene from the species of interest. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Using this strategy for a screening of different Clostridium ssp. will provide new insights into the diversity of hydrogenase genes and should be a first step to study a complex hydrogen metabolism of this genus.
TI  - Characterization of a microbial consortium capable of degrading lignocellulose.
AB  - A microbial consortium, designated WCS-6, was established by successive subcultivation in the presence of rice straw under static conditions. The degradation efficiencies of WSC-6 for 0.5 g filter paper, cotton and rice straw after 3 days of cultivation were 99.0+/-0.7%, 76.9+/-1.5% and 81.3+/-0.8%, respectively as determined by gravimetrical methods. Nine bacterial isolates were obtained from WCS-6 plated under aerobic conditions, and sequencing of their 16S rDNA indicated that these bacteria were related to Bacillus thermoamylovorans BTa, Paenibacillus barengoltzii SAFN-016, Proteobacterium S072, Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis CB-226, Rhizobiaceae str. M100, Bacillus sp. E53-10, Beta proteobacterium HMD444, Petrobacter succinimandens 4BON, and Tepidiphilus margaritifer N2-214. DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and sequencing of 16S rDNA sequences amplified from total consortium DNA revealed the presence of sequences related to those of Ureibacillus thermosphaericus, uncultured bacterium clone GC3, uncultured Clostridium sp. clone A1-3, Clostridium thermobutyricum, and Clostridium thermosuccinogenes in addition to the sequences identified from the cultured bacteria. The microbial community identified herein is a potential candidate consortium for the degradation of waste lignocellulosic biomass.
TI  - Physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in Greece and its public health implications.
AB  - Ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. To evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100 ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of Epirus were studied. The following microbiological parameters were determined: Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens. E. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. Samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter sp. and V. cholerae were not detected. Spore forms of C. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's P. aeruginosa and Yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. The presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. In view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic soy product on fecal microbiota and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in an animal model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous work showed that daily ingestion of an aqueous soy extract fermented with Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Lactobacillus helveticus 416, supplemented or not with isoflavones, reduced the total cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels, increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration and inhibited the raising of autoantibody against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL Ab) and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiota in order to investigate the possible correlation between fecal microbiota, serum lipid parameters and atherosclerotic lesion development in rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia, that ingested the aqueous soy extract fermented with Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Lactobacillus helveticus 416. METHODS: The rabbits were randomly allocated to five experimental groups (n = 6): control (C), hypercholesterolemic (H), hypercholesterolemic plus unfermented soy product (HUF), hypercholesterolemic plus fermented soy product (HF) and hypercholesterolemic plus isoflavone-supplemented fermented soy product (HIF). Lipid parameters and microbiota composition were analyzed on days 0 and 60 of the treatment and the atherosclerotic lesions were quantified at the end of the experiment. The fecal microbiota was characterized by enumerating the Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteria and Clostridium spp. populations. RESULTS: After 60 days of the experiment, intake of the probiotic soy product was correlated with significant increases (P < 0.05) on Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. and a decrease in the Enterobacteria population. A strong correlation was observed between microbiota composition and lipid profile. Populations of Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were negatively correlated with total cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, autoantibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDL Ab) and lesion size. HDL-C levels were positively correlated with Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Enterococcus spp. populations. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, daily ingestion of the probiotic soy product, supplemented or not with isoflavones, may contribute to a beneficial balance of the fecal microbiota and this modulation is associated with an improved cholesterol profile and inhibition of atherosclerotic lesion development.
TI  - Bivalent transition metal complexes of o-hydroxyacetophenone [N-(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl)] hydrazone: spectroscopic, antibacterial, antifungal activity and thermogravimetric studies.
AB  - Schiff base complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) with the o-hydroxyacetophenone [N-(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl)] hydrazone (H(2)o-HAHNH) containing N and O donor sites have been synthesized. Both ligand and its metal complexes were characterized by different physicochemical methods, elemental analysis, molar conductivity ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, UV-visible, ESR, MS spectra) and also thermal analysis (TG and DTG) techniques. The discussion of the outcome data of the prepared complexes indicates that the ligand behave as a bidentate and/or tridentate ligand. The electronic spectra of the complexes as well as their magnetic moments suggest octahedral geometries for all isolated complexes. The room temperature solid state ESR spectrum of the Cu(II) complex shows d(x2-y2) as a ground state, suggesting tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry around Cu(II) centre. The molar conductance measurements proved that the complexes are non-electrolytes. The kinetic thermodynamic parameters such as: E(#), DeltaH(#), DeltaG(#), DeltaS(#) are calculated from the DTG curves, for the [Ni(H(O)-HAHNH)(2)] and [Zn(H(2O)-HAHNH)(OAc)(2)].H(2)O complexes using the Coats-Redfern equation. Also, the antimicrobial properties of all compounds were studied using a wide spectrum of bacterial and fungal strains. The [Cu(Ho-HAHNH)(OAc)(H(2)O)(2)] complex was the most active against all strains, including Aspergillus sp., Stemphylium sp. and Trichoderma sp. Fungi; E. coli and Clostridium sp. Bacteria.
TI  - Fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  - The effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (Calopogonium muconoides and Centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. The results revealed observable effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria. The effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. Ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. Nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. The contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. A range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. The heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). On the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution levels. The LSD tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. The results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. Among the bacterial species isolated, Clostridium pasteurianum, Bacillus polymyxa and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than Azotobacter sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Derxia gummusa while Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter had the least degradability. A continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the Niger Delta ultisol.
TI  - Etiologic agents and diseases found associated with clinical aspergillosis in falcons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe parasitological, microbiological, and pathological findings associated with the isolation of Aspergillus species in 94 clinically diseased captive falcons from Dubai. Concomitant agents and/or diseases were identified in 64 cases, causing either single (n = 36) or multiple coinfections (n = 28). Diagnoses found more often in association with aspergillosis were chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) (n = 29), Caryospora sp. (n = 16), Serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to Strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), Babesia shortti (n = 4), Mannheimia (Pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). Compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of Babesia shortti, CFIDS, Mannheimia (Pastorella) haemolytica, Escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. These entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.
TI  - Botulism in Brazil, 2000-2008: epidemiology, clinical findings and laboratorial diagnosis.
AB  - Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal illness caused by Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin. We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4%) presented the toxin (nine type A, five type AB and eight with an unidentified type); in food samples, eight (9.9%) were positive for the toxin (five type A, one type AB and two with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Ruminococcus faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Bacterial strain Eg2(T), an anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-motile, and non-spore-forming coccus, was isolated from human faeces. The optimal temperature for its growth was 37 degrees C. Oxidase activity was negative, but catalase activity was positive. The strain was able to hydrolyze esculin and to produce acids from the fermentation of several substrates, including glucose. Lactic and acetic acids were the main products of glucose fermentation. The major fatty acids present in this strain were C(16:0), C(14:0), and C(18:1) cis11 DMA. The G+C content was 43.4 mol%. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain Eg2(T) was closely related to species of the genus Ruminococcus (96.3% similarity to R. torques and 96.2% similarity to R. lactaris), and its taxonomic position was placed within the Clostridium cluster XIVa. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic, and phylogenetic evidence, we propose that this novel strain be assigned to the genus Ruminococcus and be named Ruminococcus faecis sp. nov. The type strain is Eg2(T) (=KCTC 5757(T) =JCM 15917(T)).
TI  - Study of organic honey from the Northeast Portugal.
AB  - Concerns about traces of numerous toxic substances and authenticity have prompted consumer demand for honey that is certified as organic, based on strict ecological, natural principles and traceability. The present study aims to characterize organic honey samples (n = 73) from Northeast Portugal, with respect to floral nectar origin, physicochemical parameters and microbial safety. The phenols and flavonoids contents, often referred to as responsible for honey's bioactive properties, were also assessed. All organic honey samples were classified as monofloral lavender (Lavandula sp.), exceeded in quality the international physicochemical standards and showed low microbiological counts (yeast, moulds and aerobic mesophiles), with negative results in respect to fecal coliforms, Salmonella and sulphite-reducing Clostridium spp. Correlation of the palynological, physicochemical and microbiological results is necessary to check the authenticity, quality and sanitation of honey. Although not required by international legislation, results of those assessments provide a complete outlook and elucidation of the organic honey's properties, which could promote its valorisation.
TI  - Global and grain-specific accumulation of glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanases in transgenic maize (Zea mays).
AB  - In planta expression of cell wall degrading enzymes is a promising approach for developing optimized biomass feedstocks that enable low-cost cellulosic biofuels production. Transgenic plants could serve as either an enzyme source for the hydrolysis of pretreated biomass or as the primary biomass feedstock in an autohydrolysis process. In this study, two xylanase genes, Bacillus sp. NG-27 bsx and Clostridium stercorarium xynB, were expressed in maize (Zea mays) under the control of two different promoters. Severe phenotypic effects were associated with xylanase accumulation in maize, including stunted plants and sterile grains. Global expression of these xylanases from the rice ubiquitin 3 promoter (rubi3) resulted in enzyme accumulation of approximately 0.01 mg enzyme per gram dry weight, or approximately 0.1% of total soluble protein (TSP). Grain-specific expression of these enzymes from the rice glutelin 4 promoter (GluB-4) resulted in higher-level accumulation of active enzyme, with BSX and XynB accumulating up to 4.0% TSP and 16.4% TSP, respectively, in shriveled grains from selected T0 plants. These results demonstrate the potential utility of the GluB-4 promoter for biotechnological applications. The phenotypic effects of xylanase expression in maize presented here demonstrate the difficulties of hemicellulase expression in an important crop for cellulosic biofuels production. Potential alternate approaches to achieve xylanase accumulation in planta without the accompanying negative phenotypes are discussed.
TI  - Involvement of Clostridium gasigenes and C. algidicarnis in 'blown pack' spoilage of Brazilian vacuum-packed beef.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to isolate psychrotrophic clostridia from Brazilian vacuum-packed beef cuts (spoiled or not) and to identify the isolates by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Anaerobic psychrotrophic microorganisms were also enumerated and samples were collected to verify the incidence of psychrotrophic clostridia in the abattoir environment. Vacuum-packed beef cuts (n=8 grossly distended and n=5 non-spoiled) and environmental samples were obtained from a beef packing plant located in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Each sample was divided in three subsamples (exudate, beef surface and beef core) that were analyzed for vegetative forms, total spore-forming, and sulfide reducing spore-forming, both activated by alcohol and heat. Biochemical profiles of the isolates were obtained using API20A, with further identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The growth temperature and the pH range were also assessed. Populations of psychrotrophic anaerobic vegetative microorganisms of up to 10(10)CFU/(g, mL or 100 cm(2)) were found in 'blown pack' samples, while in non-spoiled samples populations of 10(5)CFU/(g, CFU/mL or CFU/100 cm(2)) was found. Overall, a higher population of total spores and sulfide reducing spores activated by heat in spoiled samples was found. Clostridium gasigenes (n=10) and C. algidicarnis (n=2) were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Among the ten C. gasigenes isolates, six were from spoiled samples (C1, C2 and C9), two were isolated from non-spoiled samples (C4 and C5) and two were isolated from the hide and the abattoir corridor/beef cut conveyor belt. C. algidicarnis was recovered from spoiled beef packs (C2). Although some samples (C3, C7, C10 and C14) presented signs of 'blown pack' spoilage, Clostridium was not recovered. C. algidicarnis (n=1) and C. gasigenes (n=9) isolates have shown a psychrotrophic behavior, grew in the range 6.2-8.2. This is the first report on the isolation of psychrotrophic Clostridium (C. gasigenes and C. algidicarnis) in Brazil. This study shows that psychrotrophic Clostridium may pose a risk for the stability of vacuum-packed beef produced in tropical countries during shelf-life and highlights the need of adopting control measures to reduce their incidence in abattoir and the occurrence of 'blown pack' spoilage.
TI  - Development and characterization of DehaloR^2, a novel anaerobic microbial consortium performing rapid dechlorination of TCE to ethene.
AB  - A novel anaerobic consortium, named DehaloR^2, that performs rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) to ethene is described. DehaloR^2 was developed from estuarine sediment from the Back River of the Chesapeake Bay and has been stably maintained in the laboratory for over 2 years. Initial sediment microcosms showed incomplete reduction of TCE to DCE with a ratio of trans- to cis- isomers of 1.67. However, complete reduction to ethene was achieved within 10 days after transfer of the consortium to sediment-free media and was accompanied by a shift to cis-DCE as the prevailing intermediate metabolite. The microbial community shifted from dominance of the Proteobacterial phylum in the sediment to Firmicutes and Chloroflexi in DehaloR^2, containing the genera Acetobacterium, Clostridium, and the dechlorinators Dehalococcoides. Also present were Spirochaetes, possible acetogens, and Geobacter which encompass previously described dechlorinators. Rates of TCE to ethene reductive dechlorination reached 2.83 mM Cl- d(-1) in batch bottles with a Dehalococcoides sp. density of 1.54E+11 gene copies per liter, comparing favorably to other enrichment cultures described in the literature and identifying DehaloR^2 as a promising consortium for use in bioremediation of chlorinated ethene-impacted environments.
TI  - Isolation of microbial pathogens of subclinical mastitis from raw sheep's milk of Epirus (Greece) and their role in its hygiene.
AB  - The natural raw milk microflora is a factor that expresses its sensorial characteristics. The microbial charge into the mammary gland of healthy animal is low and the application of right and healthy conditions during milking and cheese making procedure, prevents from contaminating as well as maintains the natural microflora in order to lend the particular characteristics of milk. The purpose of the present project was the study of the Total Viable Count (T.V.C.) and the count of total psychrotropic bacteria of raw sheep milk from Boutsiko and Karamaniko breeds, collected from healthy animals, as well as the isolation, identification and enumeration of pathogenic bacteria related with the hygiene and the quality of raw sheep milk (with a particular interest in bacteria that may cause human infection). During the experiment we examined two hundred forty (240) samples of raw sheep milk. In these samples a) Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens (vegetative cells and spores) and Bacillus sp. were isolated and identified b) the Total Viable Count and the total number of psychrotropic bacteria were also specified. The sampling, the preparation of samples and decimal dilutions were based on international methods. The Total viable count was determined using the standard methods of the American Public Health Association, 2002. The total number of psychrotropic bacteria was determined using APHA 1976, 1978 rules. The identification of the bacteria was carried out according to the Bergey's manual. Microscopic examination of Gram stained cells, catalase, oxidase and biochemical tests were performed when necessary to further identify. From the 240 milk samples tested, only 5% were E. coli positive, with mean counts ranged from 2 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml. S. aureus was isolated from 24% of the samples and the mean count per ml was ranged from <10 to 3.4 x 10(2). Meanwhile, Bacillus spp. was also detected in 29% samples. Vegetative forms and spores of C. perfringens were detected in 13% and 63% of the samples respectively. However, microbiological analyses revealed the presence of a small number of selected pathogens in milk samples such as Salmonella, which was only detected in 5% of the samples. Listeria sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Vibrio cholerae were never found. From the experimental results, the Total Viable Count from raw sheep milk samples, fulfils the microbiological criteria of EU Legislation in a percentage of approximately 97%.
TI  - A novel low-temperature-active beta-glucosidase from symbiotic Serratia sp. TN49  reveals four essential positions for substrate accommodation.
AB  - A 2,373-bp full-length gene (bglA49) encoding a 790-residue polypeptide (BglA49)  with a calculated mass of 87.8 kDa was cloned from Serratia sp. TN49, a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of longhorned beetle (Batocera horsfieldi) larvae. The deduced amino acid sequence of BglA49 showed the highest identities of 80.1% with a conceptually translated protein from Pantoea sp. At-9b (EEW02556), 38.3% with the identified glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 beta-glucosidase from Clostridium stercorarium NCBI 11754 (CAB08072), and <15.0% with the low-temperature-active GH 3 beta-glucosidases from Shewanella sp. G5 (ABL09836) and Paenibacillus sp. C7 (AAX35883). The recombinant enzyme (r-BglA49) was expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed the typical characteristics of low-temperature-active enzymes, such as low temperature optimum (showing apparent optimal activity at 35 degrees C), activity at low temperatures (retaining approximately 60% of its maximum activity at 20 degrees C and approximately 25% at 10 degrees C). Compared with the thermophilic GH 3 beta-glucosidase, r-BglA49 had fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and less proline residues. These features might relate to the increased structure flexibility and higher catalytic activity at low temperatures of r-BglA49. The molecular docking study of four GH 3 beta-glucosidases revealed five conserved positions contributing to substrate accommodation, among which four positions of r-BglA49 (R192, Y228, D260, and E449) were identified to be essential based on site-directed mutagenesis analysis.
TI  - Harvesting biohydrogen from cellobiose from sulfide or nitrite-containing wastewaters using Clostridium sp. R1.
AB  - Harvesting biohydrogen from inhibiting wastewaters is of practical interest since the toxicity of compounds in a wastewater stream commonly prevents the bioenergy content being recovered. The isolated Clostridium sp. R1 is utilized to degrade cellobiose in sulfide or nitrite-containing medium for biohydrogen production. The strain can effectively degrade cellobiose free of severe inhibitory effects at up to 200 mgl(-1) sulfide or to 5 mgl(-1) nitrite, yielding hydrogen at >2.0 mol H2 mol(-1) cellobiose. Principal metabolites of cellobiose fermentation are acetate and butyrate, with the concentration of the former increases with increasing sulfide and nitrite concentrations. The isolated strain can yield hydrogen from cellobiose in sulfide-laden wastewaters. However, the present of nitrite significantly limit the efficiency of the biohydrogen harvesting process.
TI  - Simultaneous removal of hydrogen sulfide and toluene in a bioreactor: performance and characteristics of microbial community.
AB  - We investigated the correlation between performance and the bacteria community composition by H2S and toluene co-treatment. Operation of the bioreactor was divided into four stages, in which the inlet concentration of toluene and H2S were gradually increased. In Stage I, toluene was the sole target compound with an average removal efficiency of 86.49%. After adding H2S in Stage II, removal efficiency of toluene decreased immediately and recovered gradually to 85.96%. When the inlet concentration of toluene and H2S was increased in Stage III and Stage IV, respectively, the average removal efficiency for toluene increased continuously from 86.31% to 87.24%. The elimination capacities of toluene increased with increasing inlet loading rates of toluene and H2S. Results of the PCR-DGGE analysis showed a turnover growth and decline of the microbial populations in the bioreactor. In Stage I, the dominant toluene-degrading bacteria mainly contained Pseudomonas sp. strain PS+ and Hydrogenophaga sp. In Stage IV, however, the dominant toluene-degrading bacteria was aciduric bacteria (Clostridium populeti). The dominant microbial community in the bioreactor enhanced the elimination capacity of toluene, and adding H2S changed the environment of microbial growth, thus resulted in an evolution of dominant microorganisms. Analyses of microbial community and their activities provides valuable information to efficiently enhance simultaneous removal of toluene and H2S in the bioreactor.
TI  - Characterization of cellulolytic enzymes and bioH2 production from anaerobic thermophilic Clostridium sp. TCW1.
AB  - A thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Clostridium sp. TCW1 was isolated from dairy cow dung and was used to produce hydrogen from cellulosic feedstock. Extracellular cellulolytic enzymes produced from TCW1 strain were identified as endoglucanases (45, 53 and 70 kDa), exoglucanase (70 kDa), xylanases (53 and 60 kDa), and beta-glucosidase (45 kDa). The endoglucanase and xylanase were more abundant. The optimal conditions for H2 production and enzyme production of the TCW1 strain were the same (60 degrees C, initial pH 7, agitation rate of 200 rpm). Ten cellulosic feedstock, including pure or natural cellulosic materials, were used as feedstock for hydrogen production by Clostridium strain TCW1 under optimal culture conditions. Using filter paper at 5.0 g/L resulted in the most effective hydrogen production performance, achieving a H2 production rate and yield of 57.7 ml/h/L and 2.03 mol H2/mol hexose, respectively. Production of cellulolytic enzyme activities was positively correlated with the efficiency of dark-H2 fermentation.
TI  - Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic feedstock by novel cellulases originating from Pseudomonas sp. CL3 for fermentative hydrogen production.
AB  - A newly isolated indigenous bacterium Pseudomonas sp. CL3 was able to produce novel cellulases consisting of endo-beta-1,4-d-glucanase (80 and 100 kDa), exo-beta-1,4-d-glucanase (55 kDa) and beta-1,4-d-glucosidase (65 kDa) characterized by enzyme assay and zymography analysis. In addition, the CL3 strain also produced xylanase with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was 50, 45, 45 and 55 degrees C for endo-beta-1,4-d-glucanase, exo-beta-1,4-d-glucanase, beta-1,4-d-glucosidase and xylanase, respectively. All the enzymes displayed optimal activity at pH 6.0. The cellulases/xylanase could hydrolyze cellulosic materials very effectively and were thus used to hydrolyze natural agricultural waste (i.e., bagasse) for clean energy (H2) production by Clostridium pasteurianum CH4 using separate hydrolysis and fermentation process. The maximum hydrogen production rate and cumulative hydrogen production were 35 ml/L/h and 1420 ml/L, respectively, with a hydrogen yield of around 0.96 mol H2/mol glucose.
TI  - Alkyl-methylimidazolium ionic liquids affect the growth and fermentative metabolism of Clostridium sp.
AB  - In this study, the effect of ionic liquids, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [EMIM][Ac], 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium diethylphosphate [EMIM][DEP], and 1-methyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate [MMIM][DMP] on the growth and glucose fermentation of Clostridium sp. was investigated. Among the three ionic liquids tested, [MMIM][DMP] was found to be least toxic. Growth of Clostridium sp. was not inhibited up to 2.5, 4 and 4 g L(-1) of [EMIM][Ac], [EMIM][DEP] and [MMIM][DMP], respectively. [EMIM][Ac] at <2.5 g L(-1), showed hormetic effect and stimulated the growth and fermentation by modulating medium pH. Total organic acid production increased in the presence of 2.5 and 2 g L(-1) of [EMIM][Ac] and [MMIM][DMP]. Ionic liquids had no significant influence on alcohol production at <2.5 g L(-1). Total gas production was affected by ILs at >/= 2.5 g L(-1) and varied with type of methylimidazolium IL. Overall, the results show that the growth and fermentative metabolism of Clostridium sp. is not impacted by ILs at concentrations below 2.5 g L(-1).
TI  - Quality of water sources used as drinking water in a Brazilian peri-urban area.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to assess bacteriological quality of drinking water in a peri-urban area located in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 89 water samples were collected from community plastic tanks and 177 water samples from wells were collected bimonthly, from September 2007 to November 2008, for evaluating bacteriological parameters including: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and heterotrophic plate count (HPC). Clostridium perfringens was investigated in a subsample (40 samples from community plastic tank and 40 from wells). E. coli was present in 5 (5.6%) samples from community plastic tanks (2.0 - 5.1x10(4) MPN/100mL) and in 70 (39.5%) well samples (2.0 - 8.6x10(4) MPN/100mL). Thus, these samples were not in accordance with the Brazilian Regulation. Enterococcus was detected in 20 (22.5%) samples of the community plastic tanks (1 to 79 NC/100mL) and in 142 (80.2%) well samples (1 to >200 NC/100mL). C. perfringens was detected in 5 (12.5%) community plastic tanks samples and in 35 (87.5%) wells samples (2.2 to >16 MPN/100mL). HPC were above 500 CFU/mL in 5 (5.6%) waters from community plastic tanks. In wells samples, the HPC ranged from <1 to 1.6x10(4) CFU/mL. The residual chlorine did not attend the standard established in the drinking water legislation (0.2 mg/L), except in 20 (22.5%) samples. These results confirm the vulnerability of the water supply systems in this peri-urban area what is clearly a public health concern.
TI  - Microbial ecology of fish species ongrowing in Greek sea farms and their watery environment.
AB  - The present study focuses on the bacteriological profile of both watery ecosystem and fishes from different North and Central West Greek fish-farms ongrowing euryhaline fish species. The natural microflora of the fish and the water of their ongrowing units in selected farms were studied for a period of 20 months. The analyzed samples were mainly sea bream (Sparus aurata) 61.3% and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 24%. In most of the watery ecosystems coming from the different sampling areas, total and fecal coliforms as well as total and fecal streptococci were abundant in all water samples. Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas were present at a level of 3 logs cfu/100 ml. The anaerobic Clostridium perfringens was found in vegetative (21.3%) and spore forms (13.3%). It is of interest to note that pathogens as Pasteurella piscicida and Vibrio anguillarum were isolated only in a small number of samples. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 4% of the samples, other Staphylococcus sp. in 29.3%, E. coli in 30.7%, Salmonella sp. in 1.3%, Pseudomonas sp. in 13.3%, Clostridia lec(-) in 49.3%, Bacillus sp. in 38.7%, Vibrio sp. in 18.7%, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus sp. in 36% kappaalphaiota 29.3% respectively. Vegetative forms of C. perfringens were detected in 22.7%. Although, our results showed no significant correlations between the sea water and fish microflora, more focus on this bipolar interacting system should be necessary in order to avoid any possible disturbance in the balance of the healthy farming ecosystem with the host organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Long-term effect of inoculum pretreatment on fermentative hydrogen production by  repeated batch cultivations: homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis as competitors to hydrogen production.
AB  - Long-term effects of inoculum pretreatments (heat, acid, loading-shock) on hydrogen production from glucose under different temperatures (37 degrees C, 55 degrees C) and initial pH (7 and 5.5) were studied by repeated batch cultivations. Results obtained showed that it was necessary to investigate the long-term effect of inoculum pretreatment on hydrogen production since pretreatments may just temporarily inhibit the hydrogen consuming processes. After long-term cultivation, pretreated inocula did not enhance hydrogen production compared to untreated inocula under mesophilic conditions (initial pH 7 and pH 5.5) and thermophilic conditions (initial pH 7). However, pretreatment could inhibit lactate production and lead to higher hydrogen yield under thermophilic conditions at initial pH 5.5. The results further demonstrated that inoculum pretreatment could not permanently inhibit either methanogenesis or homoacetogenesis, and methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis could only be inhibited by proper control of fermentation pH and temperature. Methanogenic activity could be inhibited at pH lower than 6, both under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, while homoacetogenic activity could only be inhibited under thermophilic condition at initial pH 5.5. Microbial community analysis showed that pretreatment did not affect the dominant bacteria. The dominant bacteria were Clostridium butyricum related organisms under mesophilic condition (initial pH 7 and 5.5), Thermoanaerobacterium sp. related organisms under thermophilic condition (initial pH 7), and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum related organisms under thermophilic condition (initial pH 5.5). Results from this study clearly indicated that the long-term effects of inoculum pretreatments on hydrogen production, methanogenesis, homoacetogenesis and dominant bacteria were dependent on fermentation temperature and pH.
TI  - Rewiring hydrogenase-dependent redox circuits in cyanobacteria.
AB  - Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible reaction 2H(+) + 2e(-) <--> H(2) with an equilibrium constant that is dependent on the reducing potential of electrons carried by their redox partner. To examine the possibility of increasing the photobiological production of hydrogen within cyanobacterial cultures, we expressed the [FeFe] hydrogenase, HydA, from Clostridium acetobutylicum in the non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. 7942. We demonstrate that the heterologously expressed hydrogenase is functional in vitro and in vivo, and that the in vivo hydrogenase activity is connected to the light-dependent reactions of the electron transport chain. Under anoxic conditions, HydA activity is capable of supporting light-dependent hydrogen evolution at a rate > 500-fold greater than that supported by the endogenous [NiFe] hydrogenase. Furthermore, HydA can support limited growth solely using H(2) and light as the source of reducing equivalents under conditions where Photosystem II is inactivated. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of exogenous ferredoxins can modulate redox flux in the hydrogenase-expressing strain, allowing for greater hydrogen yields and for dark fermentation of internal energy stores into hydrogen gas.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a ferulic acid esterase (Fae1A) from the rumen  fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus.
AB  - AIMS: A novel ferulic acid esterase gene from rumen fungus Anaeromyces mucronatus was cloned, heteroexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 clones exhibiting activity on alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha-NA) were isolated from an A. mucronatus YE505 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that these clones represented two esterase-coding sequences. The gene, fae1A, showed highest amino acid sequence identity to CE family 1 esterases from anaerobic micro-organisms such as Orpinomyces sp., Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium thermocellum. The gene comprised 828 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 275 amino acids. The coding sequence was cloned into the pET30a expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Gene product Fae1A was found to exhibit activity against a number of substrates including naphthyl fatty acid esters, p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters and hydroxylcinnamic acid esters. CONCLUSIONS: Fae1A exhibited a lower K(m) and higher catalytic efficiency (k(cat) /K(m) ) on ferulic acid esters than on alpha-NA or p-nitrophenyl acetate, suggesting that it has a higher affinity for ethyl and methyl ferulate than for the acetyl esters. It releases ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from barley straw. Activity of Fae1A was inhibited by the serine-specific protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that a serine residue plays a role in its activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of carbohydrate esterase gene from the genus of Anaeromyces.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a hydrogen- and ethanol-producing Clostridium sp. strain URNW.
AB  - Identification, characterization, and end-product synthesis patterns were analyzed in a newly identified mesophilic, anaerobic Clostridium sp. strain URNW, capable of producing hydrogen (H(2)) and ethanol. Metabolic profiling was used to characterize putative end-product synthesis pathways of the Clostridium sp. strain URNW, which was found to grow on cellobiose; on hexose sugars, such as glucose, sucrose, and mannose; and on sugar alcohols, like mannitol and sorbitol. When grown in batch cultures on 2 g cellobiose.L(-)(1), Clostridium sp. strain URNW showed a cell generation time of 1.5 h, and the major end-products were H2, formate, carbon dioxide (CO(2)), lactate, butyrate, acetate, pyruvate, and ethanol. The total volumetric H(2) production was 14.2 mmol.(L culture)(-)(1) and the total production of ethanol was 0.4 mmol.(L culture)(-)(1). The maximum yield of H(2) was 1.3 mol.(mol glucose equivalent)(-)(1) at a carbon recovery of 94%. The specific production rates of H(2), CO(2), and ethanol were 0.45, 0.13, and 0.003 mol.h(-)(1).(g dry cell mass)-1, respectively. BLAST analyses of 16S rDNA and chaperonin 60 (cpn60) sequences from Clostridium sp. strain URNW revealed a 98% nucleotide sequence identity with the 16S rDNA and cpn60 sequences from Clostridium intestinale ATCC 49213. Phylogenetic analyses placed Clostridium sp. strain URNW within the butyrate-synthesizing clostridia.
TI  - Description of Christensenella minuta gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces, which forms a distinct branch in the order Clostridiales, and proposal of Christensenellaceae fam. nov.
AB  - A novel, strictly anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, short, straight rod with tapered ends, designated YIT 12065(T), was isolated from human faeces. Strain YIT 12065(T) was saccharolytic and negative for catalase, oxidase and urease, hydrolysis of aesculin and gelatin, nitrate reduction and indole production. The end products of glucose fermentation were acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid. The DNA G+C content was 51.3 mol%. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C(15:0), C(16:0) and C(14:0). Respiratory quinones were not detected. The cell wall contained glutamic acid, serine, alanine and ll-diaminopimelic acid. The whole-cell sugars were ribose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences using three treeing algorithms revealed that the strain formed a novel family-level lineage within the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales. Caldicoprobacter oshimai JW/HY-331(T) was shown to be the closest named relative on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (86.9%), followed by Tindallia californiensis DSM 14871(T) (86.3%) and Clostridium ganghwense JCM 13193(T) (86.1%). Similar 16S rRNA gene sequences (98.6-96.7%) were found amongst faecal uncultured clones of human and dugong (Dugong dugon). They clustered with strain YIT 12065(T) in a distinct and deep evolutionary lineage of descent in the order Clostridiales. The distinct phylogenetic position supports the proposal of Christensenella gen. nov., with the type species Christensenella minuta sp. nov. (type strain YIT 12065(T) =DSM 22607(T) =JCM 16072(T)). A new family Christensenellaceae fam. nov. is also proposed.
TI  - Rapid acclimation of methanogenic granular sludge into denitrifying sulfide removal granules.
AB  - Rapid formation of denitrifying sulfide removal granules is of practical interest to start up an expanded granular sludge bed reactor for wastewater treatment. This study demonstrates that methanogenic granules can be easily acclimated into DSR granules in one day, removing all 1.30 kg m(-3) d(-1) sulfide and converting >90% of 0.56 kg-Nm(-3)d(-1) nitrate into di-nitrogen gas. Under high loadings, reactor performance, however, declined. Under high loading rates, sulfide first inhibited the heterotrophic denitrifier (Caldithrix sp.), thereby accumulating nitrite in the system; the autotrophic denitrifier (Pseudomonas sp. C23) was then inhibited by accumulated nitrite, leading to breakdown of the entire DSR process.
TI  - Rho signaling pathway and apical constriction in the early lens placode.
AB  - Epithelial invagination in many model systems is driven by apical cell constriction, mediated by actin and myosin II contraction regulated by GTPase activity. Here we investigate apical constriction during chick lens placode invagination. Inhibition of actin polymerization and myosin II activity by cytochalasin D or blebbistatin prevents lens invagination. To further verify if lens placode invaginate through apical constriction, we analyzed the role of Rho-ROCK pathway. Rho GTPases expression at the apical portion of the lens placode occurs with the same dynamics as that of the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of the pan-Rho inhibitor C3 exotoxin abolished invagination and had a strong effect on apical myosin II enrichment and a mild effect on apical actin localization. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of ROCK activity interfered significantly with apical enrichment of both actin and myosin. These results suggest that apical constriction in lens invagination involves ROCK but apical concentration of actin and myosin are regulated through different pathways upstream of ROCK. genesis 49:368-379, 2011.
TI  - The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is able to express an active [FeFe]-hydrogenase without additional maturation proteins.
AB  - [FeFe]-hydrogenases have been claimed as the most promising catalysts of hydrogen bioproduction and several efforts have been accomplished to express and purify them. However, previous attemps to obtain a functional recombinant [FeFe]-hydrogenase in heterologous systems such as Escherichia coli failed due to the lack of the specific maturation proteins driving the assembly of its complex active site. The unique exception is that of [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum that has been expressed in active form in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7942, which holds a bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase with a well characterized maturation system, suggesting that the latter is flexible enough to drive the synthesis of a [FeFe]-enzyme. However, the capability of cyanobacteria to correctly fold a [FeFe]-hydrogenase in the absence of its auxiliary maturation proteins is a debated question. In this work, we expressed the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as an active enzyme in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our results, using a different experimental system, confirm that cyanobacteria are able to express a functional [FeFe]-hydrogenase even in the absence of additional chaperones.
TI  - Analysis of the unexplored features of rrs (16S rDNA) of the Genus Clostridium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny based on rrs (16S rDNA) sequencing is being vigorously pursued. In fact, it has been stated that novel biological findings are driven by comparison and integration of massive data sets. In spite of a large reservoir of rrs sequencing data of 1,237,963 entries, this analysis invariably needs supplementation with other genes. The need is to divide the genetic variability within a taxa or genus at their rrs phylogenetic boundaries and to discover those fundamental features, which will enable the bacteria to naturally fall within them. Within the large bacterial community, Clostridium represents a large genus of around 110 species of significant biotechnological and medical importance. Certain Clostridium strains produce some of the deadliest toxins, which cause heavy economic losses. We have targeted this genus because of its high genetic diversity, which does not allow accurate typing with the available molecular methods. RESULTS: Seven hundred sixty five rrs sequences (> 1200 nucleotides, nts) belonging to 110 Clostridium species were analyzed. On the basis of 404 rrs sequences belonging to 15 Clostridium species, we have developed species specific: (i) phylogenetic framework, (ii) signatures (30 nts) and (iii) in silico restriction enzyme (14 Type II REs) digestion patterns. These tools allowed: (i) species level identification of 95 Clostridium sp. which are presently classified up to genus level, (ii) identification of 84 novel Clostridium spp. and (iii) potential reduction in the number of Clostridium species represented by small populations. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated approach is quite sensitive and can be easily extended as a molecular tool for diagnostic and taxonomic identification of any microbe of importance to food industries and health services. Since rapid and correct identification allows quicker diagnosis and consequently treatment as well, it is likely to lead to reduction in economic losses and mortality rates.
TI  - Tailor-made type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases and their use for the biosynthesis  of polylactic acid and its copolymer in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previously, we have developed metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains capable of producing polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] by employing evolved Clostridium propionicum propionate CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)). Introduction of mutations four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481) of PhaC1( Ps6-19) have been found to affect the polymer content, lactate mole fraction, and molecular weight of P(3HB-co-LA). In this study, we have further engineered type II Pseudomonas PHA synthases 1 (PhaC1s) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Pseudomonas resinovorans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to accept short-chain-length hydroxyacyl-CoAs including lactyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as substrates by site-directed mutagenesis of four sites (E130, S325, S477, and Q481). All PhaC1s having mutations in these four sites were able to accept lactyl-CoA as a substrate and supported the synthesis of P(3HB-co-LA) in recombinant E. coli, whereas the wild-type PhaC1s could not accumulate polymers in detectable levels. The contents, lactate mole fractions, and the molecular weights of P(3HB-co-LA) synthesized by recombinant E. coli varied depending upon the source of the PHA synthase and the mutants used. PLA homopolymer could also be produced at ca. 7 wt.% by employing the several PhaC1 variants containing E130D/S325T/S477G/Q481K quadruple mutations in wild-type E. coli XL1-Blue.
TI  - Tandem use of selenocysteine: adaptation of a selenoprotein glutaredoxin for reduction of selenoprotein methionine sulfoxide reductase.
AB  - Several engineered selenocysteine (Sec)-containing glutaredoxins (Grxs) and their enzymatic properties have been reported, but natural selenoprotein Grxs have not been previously characterized. We expressed a bacterial selenoprotein Grx from Clostridium sp. (also known as Alkaliphilus oremlandii) OhILAs in Escherichia coli and characterized this selenoenzyme and its natural Cys homologues in Clostridium and E. coli. The selenoprotein Grx had a 200-fold higher activity than its Sec-to-Cys mutant form, suggesting that Sec is essential for catalysis by this thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. Kinetic analysis also showed that the selenoprotein Grx had a 10-fold lower K(m) than Cys homologues. Interestingly, this selenoenzyme efficiently reduced a Clostridium selenoprotein methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA), suggesting that it is the natural reductant for the protein that is not reducible by thioredoxin, a common reductant for Cys-containing MsrAs. We also found that the selenoprotein Grx could not efficiently reduce a Cys version of Clostridium MsrA, whereas natural Clostridium and E. coli Cys-containing Grxs, which efficiently reduce Cys-containing MsrAs, poorly acted on the selenoprotein MsrA. This specificity for MsrA reduction could explain why Sec is utilized in Clostridium Grx and more generally provides a novel example of the use of Sec in biological systems.
TI  - Hyperfine-shifted 13C resonance assignments in an iron-sulfur protein with quantum chemical verification: aliphatic C-H...S 3-center-4-electron interactions.
AB  - Although the majority of noncovalent interactions associated with hydrogen and heavy atoms in proteins and other biomolecules are classical hydrogen bonds between polar N-H or O-H moieties and O atoms or aromatic pi electrons, high-resolution X-ray crystallographic models deposited in the Protein Data Bank show evidence for weaker C-H...O hydrogen bonds, including ones involving sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms. Little evidence is available in proteins for the (even) weaker C-H...S interactions described in the crystallographic literature on small molecules. Here, we report experimental evidence and theoretical verification for the existence of nine aliphatic (sp(3)-hybridized) C-H...S 3-center-4-electron interactions in the protein Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin. Our evidence comes from the analysis of carbon-13 NMR chemical shifts assigned to atoms near the iron at the active site of this protein. We detected anomalous chemical shifts for these carbon-13 nuclei and explained their origin in terms of unpaired spin density from the iron atom being delocalized through interactions of the type: C-H...S-Fe, where S is the sulfur of one of the four cysteine side chains covalently bonded to the iron. These results suggest that polarized sulfur atoms in proteins can engage in multiple weak interactions with surrounding aliphatic groups. We analyze the strength and angular dependence of these interactions and conclude that they may contribute small, but significant, stabilization to the molecule.
TI  - Microbial deterioration of vacuum-packaged chilled beef cuts and techniques for microbiota detection and characterization: a review.
AB  - Gas production from microbial deterioration in vacuum-packs of chilled meat leads to pack distension, which is commonly referred as blown pack. This phenomenon is attributed to some psychrophilic and psychrotrophic Clostridium species, as well as Enterobacteria. The ability of these microorganisms to grow at refrigeration temperatures makes the control by the meat industry a challenge. This type of deterioration has been reported in many countries including some plants in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. In addition to causing economic losses, spoilage negatively impacts the commercial product brand, thereby impairing the meat industry. In the case of strict anaerobes species they are difficult to grow and isolate using culture methods in conventional microbiology laboratories. Furthermore, conventional culture methods are sometimes not capable of distinguishing species or genera. DNA-based molecular methods are alternative strategies for detecting viable and non-cultivable microorganisms and strict anaerobic microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate. Here, we review the microorganisms and mechanisms involved in the deterioration of vacuum-packaged chilled meat and address the use of molecular methods for detecting specific strict anaerobic microorganisms and microbial communities in meat samples.
TI  - Changes in gut microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis administered the bacteria Lactobacillus casei DN--114001.
AB  - Gut microbiota was analyzed in children, aged 6-18 months and suffering from atopic dermatitis before and after 3 month supplementation of their diet with Lactobacillus casei DN--114001 in a dose of 109 cells daily. On completion of this period the total number of fecal Lactobacillus sp. cells decreased from 7.86 Log10 CFU/g to 6.40 Log10 CFU/g. After the next 5 months (without dietary supplementation with the probiotic bacteria) the level of Lactobacillus sp. cells was maintained at the latter value. During the dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain, the level of Bifidobacterium cells was maintained at 6.15-6.89 Log10 CFU/g while after 5 months it decreased to 5.57 Log10 CFU/g. The population of Clostridium sp. was reduced after 3 months of dietary supplementation from 6.49 to 5.83 Log10 CFU/g and was maintained at the latter level during the next 5 months. The dietary supplementation had no effect on populations of Bacteroides sp., Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Supplementation of children who developed atopic dermatitis with the preparation of Lactobacillus casei DN - 114001 positively affected their gut microbiota in terms of bifidobacteria and clostridia populations.
TI  - Performance evaluation and phylogenetic characterization of anaerobic fluidized bed reactors using ground tire and pet as support materials for biohydrogen production.
AB  - This study evaluated two different support materials (ground tire and polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) for biohydrogen production in an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) treating synthetic wastewater containing glucose (4000 mg L(-1)). The AFBR, which contained either ground tire (R1) or PET (R2) as support materials, were inoculated with thermally pretreated anaerobic sludge and operated at a temperature of 30 degrees C. The AFBR were operated with a range of hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 1 and 8h. The reactor R1 operating with a HRT of 2h showed better performance than reactor R2, reaching a maximum hydrogen yield of 2.25 mol H(2)mol(-1) glucose with 1.3mg of biomass (as the total volatile solids) attached to each gram of ground tire. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of particle samples revealed that reactor R1 favored the presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria such as Clostridium, Bacillus, and Enterobacter.
TI  - The effect of sage, sodium erythorbate and a mixture of sage and sodium erythorbate on the quality of turkey meatballs stored under vacuum and modified atmosphere conditions.
AB  - 1. The combined effect of sage (S), sodium erythorbate (SE), a mixture of sage and sodium erythorbate (MIX) and vacuum packaging (VP) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the quality of cooked turkey meatballs stored at 4 degrees C was investigated. The physicochemical properties (colour, MDA, AV, pH, water activity), microbiological quality characteristics (counts of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, fungi, coliforms and Clostridium sp.) and flavour attributes of meatballs were determined. 2. The values of the colour parameters L*, a* and b* were affected by the additives and packaging method. The colour of meatballs was better protected by sodium erythorbate than by sage or a mixture of sage and sodium erythorbate. The additives effectively stabilised lipids against oxidation and slowed down hydrolytic changes in turkey meatballs. Sage and a mixture of sage and sodium erythorbate showed stronger antioxidant properties than sodium erythorbate added alone. Products with additives were characterised by better sensory quality than control samples. Sage and MIX prevented the growth of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria. All additives inhibited the growth of coliforms. 3. MAP was more effective than VP in maintaining the microbial and sensory quality stability of cooked turkey meatballs. However, VP appears to be a better method as regards the maintaining of lipid stability in turkey meatballs.
TI  - Toxicity of various anions associated with methoxyethyl methyl imidazolium-based  ionic liquids on Clostridium sp.
AB  - We investigated the effects on the growth of the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium sp., of the ionic liquid, 1-methoxyethyl-3-methyl imidazolium [MOEMIM](+), derived from imidazolium cation and paired with one of a variety of counter-ions, viz., tetrafluoroborate [BF(4)](-), hexafluorophosphate [PF(6)](-)(,) trifluoroacetate [CF(3)COO](-), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide [Tf(2)N](-), methane sulfonate [OMS], and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate [BMIM][BF(4)]. These anions, in association with [MOEMIM](+) lowered the growth rate of the bacterium, showing the following trend: [Tf(2)N](-) >== [PF(6)](-) > [BF(4)](-) > [CF(3)COO](-) > [OMS](-). Anions incorporating fluorine were more toxic than those without it, and their toxicity rose with an increase in the number of fluorine atoms. Also, [MOEMIM](+)[BF(4)](-) was less toxic than [BMIM](+)[BF(4)](-), probably due to the presence of a methoxyethyl functional group integrated in the cation side chain.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of a maternal vaccine for the passive protection of broiler chicks against necrotic enteritis.
AB  - Necrotic enteritis is a potentially fatal multifactorial disease of chickens, which under commercial conditions is often associated with increased levels of mortality and reduced bird performance. The safety and efficacy of a Clostridium perfringens type A alpha-toxoid (Netvax) formulated as an oil emulsion was investigated, following maternal immunization of broiler breeder hens, housed under commercial conditions, by the intramuscular route. A total of 11,234 hens were vaccinated across two integrated poultry sites. The vaccine was safe with no systemic reactions or adverse effects on bird performance detected. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in anti-alpha toxin antibody in the hen that was maintained throughout the study, and subsequently transferred to their progeny throughout the laying period via egg yolk. Chicks hatched from eggs produced from vaccinated hens were shown to have reduced mortality specifically related to progeny flocks where gross gut lesions associated with necrotic enteritis were observed in control chicks. Further, whilst C. perfringens was isolated from control chicks with necrotic enteritis lesions, no such isolations were made at these time points from chicks from vaccinated hens. These results indicate that, under commercial conditions, maternal vaccination with Netvax can help to control losses related to necrotic enteritis.
TI  - Clostridium chromiireducens sp. nov., isolated from Cr(VI)-contaminated soil.
AB  - A Cr(VI)-resistant, Gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe, designated GCAF-1(T), was isolated from chromium-contaminated soil by its ability to reduce Cr(VI) in low concentrations. Mixed acid fermentation during growth on glucose resulted in accumulation of acetate, butyrate, formate and lactate. Morphological studies indicated the presence of peritrichous flagella, pili and an S-layer. The major cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were C(16 : 0), C(14 : 0), summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c), C(18 : 1)omega7c, C(16 : 1)omega9c, summed feature 4 (comprising iso-C(17 : 1) I and/or anteiso-C(17 : 1) B) and C(18 : 1)omega9c. The DNA G+C content of strain GCAF-1(T) was 30.7 mol%. Phylogenetic interference indicated that strain GCAF-1(T) clustered with group I of the genus Clostridium. Of strains within this cluster, strain GCAF-1(T) shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities (98.1-98.9 %) with Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 791(T), C. saccharobutylicum NCP 262(T), C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(T), C. puniceum DSM 2619(T) and C. roseum DSM 51(T). However, strain GCAF-1(T) could be clearly distinguished from its closest phylogenetic neighbours by low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness (<50 %) and some phenotypic features. Based on the evidence presented here, strain GCAF-1(T) ( = DSM 23318(T) = KCTC 5935(T)) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium chromiireducens sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - Dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of Gayals (Bos frontalis), Yaks (Bos  grunniens) and Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in Gayals, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle were investigated using PCR-DGGE approach. The analysis of DGGE profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16S rDNA sequences in DGGE profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. DGGE profiles revealed that Gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. A total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that Gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen dominant bacteria of Gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the genera Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium celerecrescens. Moreover, the dominant bacteria of Yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Schwartzia succinivorans and Clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. In addition, the dominant bacteria in Yunnan Yellow Cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing Prevotella sp., Staphylococci lentus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Corynebacterium casei. Present study first detected Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Epizootic rabbit enteropathy inoculum (TEC4): antibiograms and antibiotic fractionation.
AB  - Epizootic rabbit enteropathy (ERE) emerged and spread in Europe within the last 13 years causing major economical loss. The aims of the study was to evaluate antibiograms of TEC4, an inoculum composed of an extract of intestinal content of affected rabbits, and to test the potential of different antibiotic-based TEC4 fractions to reproduce the disease. Twenty nine different antibiotic discs were incubated for determining bacteria resistance. In a complementary study, nine tubes of liquid medium were inoculated with TEC4, incubated and added individually with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, bacitracin, ceftiofur, doxycycline, novobiocin, streptomycyin, tylosin, vancomycin and 0.9% saline solution as control. The content of each tube was washed by centrifugation and suspended in saline. The three most effective antibiotics are florfenicol, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and tylosin. A high concentration of Clostridium sordelli and Bacillus firmus were isolated in all fractions. Species never cultured from TEC4 were identified as Fusobacterium necrogenes (in vancomycin fraction), Cellulomonas sp (in novobiocin fraction) and Bacteroides distasonis (in doxycycline fraction). The ERE was reproduced when bacitracin, doxycycline and 0.9% fractions were inoculated. Rabbits showed ERE clinical signs with the specific drop in daily weight gain.
TI  - Analysis of the eukaryotic community and metabolites found in clay wall material  used in the construction of traditional Japanese buildings.
AB  - Clay wall (tsuchikabe in Japanese) material for Japanese traditional buildings is manufactured by fermenting a mixture of clay, sand, and rice straw. The aim of this study was to understand the fermentation process in order to gain insight into the ways waste biomass can be used to produce useful materials. In this study, in addition to Clostridium, we suggested that the family Nectriaceae and the Scutellinia sp. of fungi were important in degrading cell wall materials of rice straw, such as cellulose and/or lignin. The microorganisms in the clay wall material produced sulfur-containing inorganic compounds that may sulfurate minerals in clay particles, and polysaccharides that give viscosity to clay wall material, thus increasing workability for plastering, and possibly giving water-resistance to the dried clay wall.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. This review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in PICU settings with an international perspective. The types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. A review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with an emphasis on prevention.
TI  - Effect of beta -glucanase and xylanase supplementation of barley- and rye-based diets on caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  - 1. The aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (beta-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP)). 2. Plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. As assessed by FISH analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale followed by Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. For both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of Enterobacteriaceae. 4. The T-RFLP profiles indicated that the caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. Irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae populations.
TI  - Isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern United States.
AB  - Reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. In this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern Atlantic Coast of the United States. A total of 339 and 491 isolates from Charleston, SC (CHS) and Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 CHS/82 IRL), fecal (141 CHS/184 IRL), and blowhole (128 CHS/225 IRL) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. The most frequently cultured Gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus Coag. Neg were the predominant organisms. For fungi, the most abundant species were Candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and Candida tropicalis. Of concern, the MRSA strain of Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from CHS dolphins. In general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from IRL than CHS animals. Together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.
TI  - Bacterial vectors and delivery systems in cancer therapy.
AB  - Live bacterial vectors may be useful tools for the development of novel cancer therapies that can be added to the repertoire of existing drugs. Several bacterial strains effectively colonize solid tumors and act as antitumor therapeutics. The naturally occurring tumor-colonizing characteristics of bacterial species such as Salmonella sp, Clostridium sp and Escherichia coli can be further modified by genetic manipulations, making these bacterial systems excellent vehicles for the production and targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules into cancer cells. This feature review summarizes recent research on cancer therapy using genetically modified bacteria. Different approaches - bactofection, DNA vaccination, and bacterially mediated protein and RNAi delivery - in which modified bacteria are used as anticancer therapeutics, are discussed.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Ultrasound-mediated DNA transformation in thermophilic gram-positive anaerobes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thermophilic, Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria (TGPAs) are generally recalcitrant to chemical and electrotransformation due to their special cell-wall structure and the low intrinsic permeability of plasma membranes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we established for any Gram-positive or thermophiles an ultrasound-based sonoporation as a simple, rapid, and minimally invasive method to genetically transform TGPAs. We showed that by applying a 40 kHz ultrasound frequency over a 20-second exposure, Texas red-conjugated dextran was delivered with 27% efficiency into Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, a TGPA that can utilize both pentose and hexose for ethanol production. Experiments that delivered plasmids showed that host-cell viability and plasmid DNA integrity were not compromised. Via sonoporation, shuttle vectors pHL015 harboring a jellyfish gfp gene and pIKM2 encoding a Clostridium thermocellum beta-1,4-glucanase gene were delivered into X514 with an efficiency of 6x10(2) transformants/microg of methylated DNA. Delivery into X514 cells was confirmed via detecting the kanamycin-resistance gene for pIKM2, while confirmation of pHL015 was detected by visualization of fluorescence signals of secondary host-cells following a plasmid-rescue experiment. Furthermore, the foreign beta-1,4-glucanase gene was functionally expressed in X514, converting the host into a prototypic thermophilic consolidated bioprocessing organism that is not only ethanologenic but cellulolytic. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we developed an ultrasound-based sonoporation method in TGPAs. This new DNA-delivery method could significantly improve the throughput in developing genetic systems for TGPAs, many of which are of industrial interest yet remain difficult to manipulate genetically.
TI  - Peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov., a Gram-positive anaerobic coccus isolated from retail ground beef.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-23883(T) was isolated from retail ground beef as part of a study on the genetic diversity of Clostridium perfringens. The strain was found to be a strictly anaerobic, Gram-positive coccus that was able to utilize peptone as a sole carbon source. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was closely related to species within the genera Peptoniphilus and Anaerosphaera, but it was substantially different from the closest recognized species by nearly 10 % sequence divergence. The strain was also found to be closely related (>99 % sequence similarity) to an uncultured bacterial strain that was sequenced from a 16S rRNA gene clone library constructed to characterize the bacterial community of faeces from a captive spotted hyena. Strain NRRL B-23883(T) shared the peptidoglycan type A4beta, l-Orn-d-Glu with members of the genus Peptoniphilus. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that strain NRRL B-23883(T) was able to utilize glycyl l-methionine as a sole carbon source, in contrast to other species of the genus Peptoniphilus. Therefore, it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species, Peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov.; the type strain is NRRL B-23883(T) ( = DSM 22461(T)).
TI  - Bacteriophage treatment significantly reduces viable Clostridium difficile and prevents toxin production in an in vitro model system.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is primarily a nosocomial pathogen, causing thousands of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in the UK each year. In this study, we used a batch fermentation model of a C. difficile colonised system to evaluate the potential of a prophylactic and a remedial bacteriophage treatment regime to control the pathogen. It is shown that the prophylaxis regime was effective at preventing the growth of C. difficile (p = <0.001) and precluded the production of detectable levels of toxins A and B. The remedial treatment regime caused a less profound and somewhat transient decrease in the number of viable C. difficile cells (p = <0.0001), but still resulted in a lower level of toxin production relative to the control. The numbers of commensal bacteria including total aerobes and anaerobes, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp., total Clostridium sp., and Enterobacteriaceae were not significantly decreased by this therapy, whereas significant detrimental effects were observed with metronidazole treatment. Our study indicates that phage therapy has potential to be used for the control of C. difficile; it highlights the main benefits of this approach, and some future challenges.
TI  - Production of hexanoic acid from D-galactitol by a newly isolated Clostridium sp. BS-1.
AB  - In a study screening anaerobic microbes utilizing D: -galactitol as a fermentable carbon source, four bacterial strains were isolated from an enrichment culture producing H(2), ethanol, butanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and hexanoic acid. Among these isolates, strain BS-1 produced hexanoic acid as a major metabolic product of anaerobic fermentation with D: -galactitol. Strain BS-1 belonged to the genus Clostridium based on phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the most closely related strain was Clostridium sporosphaeroides DSM 1294(T), with 94.4% 16S rRNA gene similarity. In batch cultures, Clostridium sp. BS-1 produced 550 +/- 31 mL L(-)(1) of H(2), 0.36 +/- 0.01 g L(-)(1) of acetic acid, 0.44 +/- 0.01 g L(-)(1) of butyric acid, and 0.98 +/- 0.03 g L(-)(1) of hexanoic acid in a 4-day cultivation. The production of hexanoic acid increased to 1.22 and 1.73 g L(-)(1) with the addition of 1.5 g L(-)(1) of sodium acetate and 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), respectively. Especially when 1.5 g L(-)(1) of sodium acetate and 100 mM MES were added simultaneously, the production of hexanoic acid increased up to 2.99 g L(-)(1). Without adding sodium acetate, 2.75 g L(-)(1) of hexanoic acid production from D-galactitol was achieved using a coculture of Clostridium sp. BS-1 and one of the isolates, Clostridium sp. BS-7, in the presence of 100 mM MES. In addition, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production by Clostridium sp. BS-1 from D-galactitol and D: -glucose was enhanced when a more reduced culture redox potential (CRP) was applied via addition of Na(2)S.9H(2)O.
TI  - Analysis of human and animal fecal microbiota for microbial source tracking.
AB  - Microbial compositions of human and animal feces from South Korea were analyzed and characterized. In total, 38 fecal samples (14 healthy adult humans, 6 chickens, 6 cows, 6 pigs and 6 geese) were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing of the V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Four major phyla, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, were identified in the samples. Principal coordinate analysis suggested that microbiota from the same host species generally clustered, with the exception of those from humans, which exhibited sample-specific compositions. A network-based analysis revealed that several operational taxonomic units (OTUs), such as Lactobacillus sp., Clostridium sp. and Prevotella sp., were commonly identified in all fecal sources. Other OTUs were present only in fecal samples from a single organism. For example, Yania sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. were identified specifically in chicken and human fecal samples, respectively. These specific OTUs or their respective biological markers could be useful for identifying the sources of fecal contamination in water by microbial source tracking.
TI  - Pseudo-outbreak of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) in a tertiary-care hospital.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe a pseudo-outbreak of C. difficile in  a hospital, following a change in the method used to detect the toxin. In February 2002, there were two cases of CDAD and in March 7 occurred, coinciding with a change of the test (from detection of toxin A to toxin A/B). An outbreak was suspected. Active surveillance and education of staff were started. A CDAD case was defined as a patient with acute onset of diarrhea (> or = three episodes of liquid stools) and a positive stool test. They were classified as hospital or community-acquired. Stool samples were also collected for C. difficile culture and isolates were typed using AP-PCR. From March 2002 through December 2003 there were 138 cases of CDAD: 70% were hospital-acquired and among the 30% with CDAD present on admission, most (81%) came directly from the community (50% had no history of hospitalization). Fifty-two percent of hospital-acquired CDAD and 94% of cases on admission had already used antibiotics. The incidence of CDAD in hospitalized patients during surveillance was 3.3 per 1000 patient-admissions. The incidence of CDAD present on admission was 6.1/1000 patients. Sixteen isolates were typed and presented 13 different profiles. In conclusion, the CDAD increase in our study occurred due to change in diagnostic methods and not due to an outbreak, as suspected initially. The incidence in hospitalized patients was much lower than in reported outbreaks. There were 13 molecular types suggesting that an outbreak did not occur. CDAD was largely community-acquired.
TI  - Investigation of mineral water springs of Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) with cultivation-dependent microbiological methods.
AB  - Water samples of ten mineral water springs at Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) were examined during 2005-2006 using cultivation-dependent microbiological methods. The results of standard hygienic bacteriological tests showed that the Hargita Spring had perfect and five other springs had microbiologically acceptable water quality (Zsogod-, Nagy-borviz-, Taploca-, Szentegyhaza- and Lobogo springs). The water of Borsaros Spring was exceptionable (high germ count, presence of Enterococcus spp.).Both standard bacteriological and molecular microbiological methods indicated that the microbiological water quality of the Szeltersz-, Nadasszek- and Delo springs was not acceptable. Bad water quality resulted from inadequate spring catchment and hygiene (low yield, lack of runoff, negligent usage of the springs, horse manure around the spring).The 16S rRNA gene-based identification of strains isolated on standard meat-peptone medium resulted in the detection of typical aquatic organisms such as Shewanella baltica, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas veronii, Psychrobacter sp,. Acinetobacter spp. and allochthonous microbes, like Nocardia, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Microbacterium , and Arthrobacter strains indicating the impact of soil. Other allochthonous microbes, such as Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus sp., Lactococcus sp., Clostridium butyricum, Yersinia spp., Aerococcus sp., may have originated from animal/human sources.
TI  - Clostridiolysin S, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - Through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, Clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. Using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in C. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen Clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin S, a key virulence factor from group A Streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. Genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin S-like gene cluster from Clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin S.
TI  - Diversity and abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences in forestomach of alpacas (Lama pacos) and sheep (Ovis aries).
AB  - Two bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from the forestomach of alpacas and sheep fed alfalfa. After the amplification using the universal 16S rRNA gene primers, equal quantities of PCR products from the same species were mixed and used to construct the two libraries. Sequence analysis showed that the 60 clones from alpacas were divided into 27 phylotypes with 25% clones affiliated with Eubacterium sp. F1. The 60 clones from sheep were divided into 21 phylotypes with 7 phylotypes affiliated with Prevotella ruminicola (40% clones). Clones closely related to Clostridium proteoclasticum, Eubacterium sp. F1, Clostridium cellobioparum, Mogibacterium neglectum, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridiaceae bacterium WN011, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium orbiscindens, Eubacterium sp. F1, Cytophaga sp. Dex80-37, Treponema bryantii and Pelotomaculum sp. FP were only found in the forestomach of alpacas, and those to Anaerovorax odorimutans, Treponema zioleckii, Bifidobacterium indicum, Paludibacter propionicigenes, Paraprevotella clara, Eubacterium siraeum, Desulfotomaculum sp. CYP1, Clostridium bolteae, Clostridium termitidis and Clostridiaceae bacterium DJF_LS40 only in the rumen of sheep. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the forestomach of alpacas had significantly lower density of bacteria, with bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies (6.89 [Log10 (copies per gram of wet weight)]), than that of sheep (7.71, P<0.01). The two clone libraries also appeared different in Shannon index (library from alpacas 3.30 and from sheep 3.04). Our results showed that there were apparent differences in the bacterial diversity and abundance in the forestomach between alpacas and sheep.
TI  - Fecal calprotectin excretion in preterm infants during the neonatal period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal calprotectin has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease in adults and children. Fecal calprotectin levels have been reported to be much higher in both healthy full-term and preterm infants than in children and adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the time course of fecal calprotectin (f-calprotectin) excretion in preterm infants from birth until hospital discharge and to identify factors influencing f-calprotectin levels in the first weeks of life, including bacterial establishment in the gut. METHODOLOGY: F-calprotectin was determined using an ELISA assay in 147 samples obtained prospectively from 47 preterm infants (gestational age, and birth-weight interquartiles 27-29 weeks, and 880-1320 g, respectively) at birth, and at 2-week intervals until hospital discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Although median f-calprotectin excretion was 138 microg/g, a wide range of inter- and intra-individual variation in f-calprotectin values (from day 3 to day 78) was observed (86% and 67%, respectively). In multivariate regression analysis, f-calprotectin correlated negatively with ante and per natal antibiotic treatment (p = 0.001), and correlated positively with the volume of enteral feeding (mL/kg/d) (p = 0.009), the need to interrupt enteral feeding (p = 0.001), and prominent gastrointestinal colonization by Clostridium sp (p = 0.019) and Staphylococcus sp (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: During the first weeks of life, the high f-calprotectin values observed in preterm infants could be linked to the gut bacterial establishment.
TI  - Syntrophaceticus schinkii gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium isolated from a mesophilic anaerobic filter.
AB  - A mesophilic, syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain Sp3(T), was isolated from sludge from a mesophilic methanogenic digestor operating at a high ammonium concentration (6.4 g L(-1) NH(4)(+)-N). The strain showed acetate-oxidizing ability in cocultivation with a hydrogen-consuming methanogen. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis confirmed that strain Sp3(T) belonged to the Firmicutes-Clostridia class. The most closely related species was Thermacetogenium phaeum (16S rRNA gene sequence identity 92%). Strain Sp3(T) used ethanol, betaine and lactate as carbon and electron sources and showed growth between 25 and 40 degrees C and pH 6.0 and 8.0. Based on the phylogenetic position and the physiological characteristics of strain Sp3(T), this new syntrophic, acetate-oxidizing bacterium is proposed as the new genus and species Syntrophaceticus schinkii, with Sp3(T) (=JCM 16669(T)) as the type strain. An isolate (strain Esp=JCM 16670) with high 16S rRNA gene sequence identity (99%) to syntrophic acetate-oxidizing Clostridium ultunense was also retrieved from the methanogenic digestor.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for detection of recombinant genes encoding fatty acid desaturases fused with lichenase reporter protein in GM plants.
AB  - Thermostable lichenase encoded by licB gene of Clostridium thermocellum can be used as a reporter protein in plant, bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. It has important advantages of high sensitivity and specificity in qualitative and quantitative assays. Deletion variants of LicB (e.g., LicBM3) retain its enzymatic activity and thermostability and can be expressed in translational fusion with target proteins without compromising with their properties. Fusion with the lichenase reporter is especially convenient for the heterologous expression of proteins whose analysis is difficult or compromised by host enzyme activities, as it is in case of fatty acid desaturases occurring in all groups of organisms. Recombinant desaturase-lichenase genes can be used for creating genetically modified (GM) plants with improved chill tolerance. Development of an analytical method for detection of fused desaturase-lichenase transgenes is necessary both for production of GM plants and for their certification. Here, we report a multiplex polymerase chain reaction method for detection of desA and desC desaturase genes of cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus vulcanus, respectively, fused to licBM3 reporter in GM plants.
TI  - A novel cold-adapted cellulase complex from Eisenia foetida: characterization of  a multienzyme complex with carboxymethylcellulase, beta-glucosidase, beta-1,3 glucanase, and beta-xylosidase.
AB  - Clostridium sp. and some bacterial cellulases exist as an enzyme complex with cellulolytic, and hemicellulolytic enzymes, so called "cellulosome". In this article, we report that EF-CMCase25 occurs as a complex with beta-glucosidase, beta-1,3 glucanase, and beta-xylosidase. The multienzyme complex had a molecular mass of 150 kDa on gel filtration under non-reducing condition. After the gel filtration, the enzyme complex was purified to homogeneous state on BN-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the purified protein is a complex with at least one CMCase (25 kDa), one beta-glucosidase (32 kDa), and one beta-1,3 glucanase (40 kDa) components. The CMCase activity in the purified enzyme complex at 15 degrees C was 44% of that obtained at the optimal temperature. The optimum pH of the EF-CMCase25 in the purified enzyme complex was pH 5.0 and stable at pH 7.0-9.0.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of biogenic amine-producing bacteria in fermented  soybean pastes.
AB  - Biogenic amines (BAs) are produced primarily by microorganisms found in fermented foods and are often implicated in food poisoning. BA-producing bacteria found in fermented soybean pastes were isolated and characterized using a decarboxylating medium and multiplex PCR analysis. Two BA-producing bacteria were isolated from traditional soybean pastes: one was a histamine-producing Clostridium strain, and the other was a tyramine-producing Pseudomonas strain. The Clostridium strain was determined to be a potent histamine producer among the cultures tested. Synthesis of tyramine by Pseudomonas sp. T1 was observed for the first time in this study.
TI  - Autoproteolytic activation of bacterial toxins.
AB  - Protease domains within toxins typically act as the primary effector domain within target cells. By contrast, the primary function of the cysteine protease domain (CPD) in Multifunctional Autoprocessing RTX-like (MARTX) and Clostridium sp. glucosylating toxin families is to proteolytically cleave the toxin and release its cognate effector domains. The CPD becomes activated upon binding to the eukaryotic-specific small molecule, inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), which is found abundantly in the eukaryotic cytosol. This property allows the CPD to spatially and temporally regulate toxin activation, making it a prime candidate for developing anti-toxin therapeutics. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to defining the regulation of toxin function by the CPD and the development of inhibitors to prevent CPD-mediated activation of bacterial toxins.
TI  - Complete stereospecific repair of a synthetic dinucleotide spore photoproduct by  spore photoproduct lyase.
AB  - Spore photoproduct lyase (SP lyase), a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily of enzymes, catalyzes the repair of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine [spore photoproduct (SP)], a type of UV-induced DNA damage unique to bacterial spores. The anaerobic purification and characterization of Clostridium acetobutylicum SP lyase heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and its catalytic activity in repairing stereochemically defined synthetic dinucleotide SPs was investigated. The purified enzyme contains between 2.3 and 3.1 iron atoms per protein. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy reveals an isotropic signal centered at g = 1.99, characteristic of a [3Fe-4S](+) cluster accounting for 3-4% of the iron in the sample. Upon reduction, a nearly axial signal (g = 2.03, 1.93 and 1.92) characteristic of a [4Fe-4S](+) cluster is observed that accounts for 34-45% of total iron. Addition of S-adenosylmethionine to the reduced enzyme produces a rhombic signal (g = 2.02, 1.93, 1.82) unique to the S-adenosyl-L: -methionine complex while decreasing the overall EPR intensity. This reduced enzyme is shown to rapidly and completely repair the 5R diastereomer of a synthetic dinucleotide SP with a specific activity of 7.1 +/- 0.6 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), whereas no repair was observed for the 5S diastereomer.
TI  - Caloramator mitchellensis sp. nov., a thermoanaerobe isolated from the geothermal waters of the Great Artesian Basin of Australia, and emended description of the genus Caloramator.
AB  - A strictly thermophilic anaerobe, designated strain VF08(T), was isolated from a  water sample collected from a Great Artesian Basin bore (registered bore number 22981) situated at Mitchell, QLD, Australia. Cells of isolate VF08(T) were slightly curved, non-sporulating rods (1.5-3.5 x 0.4-0.8 mum), which stained Gram-negative but possessed a Gram-positive cell-wall ultrastructure. The strain grew optimally in tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYEG) medium at 55 degrees C (temperature growth range between 37 and 60 degrees C) and a pH of 7 (pH growth range, 6.0-9.0). Yeast extract or tryptone was required for growth on glucose, fructose, xylose, maltose, sucrose, raffinose, cellobiose, ribose, pyruvate, tryptone, peptone, Casamino acids, amyl media and serine, but could also support growth as the sole carbon source. End products from glucose fermentation were acetate, ethanol, CO(2) and H(2). The strain reduced vanadium(V), but not iron(III), manganese(IV), elemental sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, nitrate or nitrite in the presence of 0.2 % yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, glucose, sucrose and Casamino acids, but an increase in the growth rate or cell yield was not observed. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, penicillin, ampicillin and >/= 2 % NaCl (w/v). The G+C content of the DNA was 38.4 +/- 0.8 mol% as determined by the thermal denaturation (T(m)) method. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that isolate VF08(T) was a member of the genus Caloramator with Caloramator australicus and Caloramator fervidus (formerly Clostridium fervidus) being the closest relatives with similarity values of 85.0 and 86.1 %, respectively, when helix 6 nucleotides were included in the analysis, and 95.2 % and 94 %, respectively, when these nucleotides were masked from the analysis. Further analysis revealed that strain VF08(T) formed an individual cluster (cluster II) within the genus Caloramator and could be distinguished from other species within the genus Caloramator (clusters I, III and IV) on the basis of signature nucleotides and differences in phenotypic traits. These data suggest that strain VF08(T) is a novel species of the genus Caloramator, for which the name Caloramator mitchellensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is VF08(T) (=JCM 15828(T)=KCTC 5735(T)). An emended description of the genus Caloramator is also provided.
TI  - GTPases RhoA and Rac1 are important for amelogenin and DSPP expression during differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts.
AB  - Morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation are distinct processes in tooth development. Cell proliferation predominates in morphogenesis; differentiation involves changes in form and gene expression. The cytoskeleton is essential for both processes, being regulated by Rho GTPases. The aim of this study was to verify the expression, distribution, and role of Rho GTPases in ameloblasts and odontoblasts during tooth development in correlation with actin and tubulin arrangements and amelogenin and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were strongly expressed during morphogenesis; during cytodifferentiation, RhoA was present in ameloblasts and odontoblasts, Rac1 and its effector Pak3 were observed in ameloblasts; and Cdc42 was present in all cells of the tooth germ and mesenchyme. The expression of RhoA mRNA and its effectors RockI and RockII, Rac1 and Pak3, as analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, increased after ameloblast and odontoblast differentiation, according to the mRNA expression of amelogenin and DSPP. The inhibition of all Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin A completely abolished amelogenin and DSPP expression in tooth germs cultured in anterior eye chamber, whereas the specific inhibition of the Rocks showed only a partial effect. Thus, both GTPases are important during tooth morphogenesis. During cytodifferentiation, Rho proteins are essential for the complete differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts by regulating the expression of amelogenin and DSPP. RhoA and its effector RockI contribute to this role. A specific function for Rac1 in ameloblasts remains to be elucidated; its punctate distribution indicates its possible role in exocytosis/endocytosis.
TI  - Isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of Bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  - Caecal samples from wild-type and TNF(deltaARE) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. Twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (Blautia spp., Clostridium innocuum, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus murinus, Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Shigella dysenteriae). One additional isolate, strain A-C2-0, was a new bacterium. The closest relatives were Bacteroides massiliensis, Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). Strain A-C2-0 is a Gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a G + C content of DNA of 41.5%. Its major cellular fatty acid is C(15:0 ANTEISO), and its major respiratory quinone is MK-9. Cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. They are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. When compared with related Bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. Strain A-C2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus Bacteroides, for which the name Bacteroides sartorii is proposed. The type strain is A-C2-0(T) (= DSM 21941(T) = CCUG 57211(T)).
TI  - Haloalkaliphilic spore-forming sulfidogens from soda lake sediments and description of Desulfitispora alkaliphila gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - An anaerobic enrichment with pyruvate as electron donor and thiosulfate at pH 10  and 0.6 M Na(+) inoculated with pasteurized soda lake sediments resulted in a sulfidogenic coculture of two morphotypes of obligately anaerobic haloalkaliphilic endospore-forming clostridia, which were further isolated in pure culture. Strain AHT16 was a thin long rod able to ferment sugars and pyruvate and to respire H(2), formate and pyruvate using thiosulfate and fumarate as electron acceptors and growing optimally at pH 9.5. Thiosulfate was reduced incompletely to sulfide and sulfite. The strain was closely related (99% sequence similarity) to a peptolytic alkaliphilic clostridium Natronincola peptidovorans. Strain AHT17 was a short rod with a restricted respiratory metabolism, growing with pyruvate and lactate as electron donor and sulfite, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors with a pH optimum 9.5. Thiosulfate was reduced completely via sulfite to sulfide. The ability of AHT17 to use sulfite explained the stability of the original coculture of the two clostridia-one member forming sulfite from thiosulfate and another consuming it. Strain AHT17 formed an independent deep phylogenetic lineage within the Clostridiales and is proposed as a new genus and species Desulfitisporum alkaliphilum gen. nov., sp. nov. (=DSM 22410(T) = UNIQEM U794(T)).
TI  - Diversity of microbes and potential exoelectrogenic bacteria on anode surface in  microbial fuel cells.
AB  - Single-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs), inoculated with anaerobic sludge and  continuously run with two kinds of organic wastewater influents, were systemically investigated. The diversity of microbes, determined by 16S rDNA analysis, was analyzed on three anodes under different conditions. One anode was in a closed circuit in synthetic wastewater containing glucose. The other two anodes, in open or closed circuits, were fed effluent from an anaerobic reactor treating starch wastewater. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was about 70%, and the exported voltages were about 450 mV. The 16S rDNA molecular clones of microbes on anode surfaces showed significant changes in Eubacterial structure under different conditions. gamma-Proteobacteria and the high G+C gram-positive groups were predominant in the synthetic wastewater, while epsilon-Proteobacteria predominated in the anaerobic reactor effluent. Known exoelectrogenic bacterial species composition also changed greatly depending on substrate. On the artificial substrate, 28% of the bacterial sequences were affiliated with Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Geobacter, and Desulfobulbus. On the anaerobic effluent, only 6% were affiliated with Geobacter or Clostridium. Because only a few exoelectrogenic bacteria from MFCs have been directly isolated and studied, we compared the community structures of two bacterial anodes, in open and closed circuits, under the same substrate of anaerobic effluent in order to identify additional exoelectrogenic bacterial strains. Alcaligenes monasteriensis, Comamonas denitrificans, and Dechloromonas sp. were found to be potential exoelectrogenic bacteria worthy of further research.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  - Proper folding of the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent N- or C-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. Collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. The Scl2 collagen-like protein from Streptococcus pyogenes has an N-terminal globular domain, designated V(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. The V(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the Scl2 protein in vitro. Here, recombinant V(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of T(m) = 45 degrees C. Examination of a new construct shows that the V(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located N-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when C-terminal to the triple-helix domain. Fusion of the V(sp) domain N-terminal to a heterologous (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence from Clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on its own. These results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. This information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Novel real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Clostridium chauvoei and Clostridium septicum in clostridial myonecrosis.
AB  - A real-time PCR assay based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence was designed for differentiation of blackleg-causing Clostridium chauvoei and Clostridium septicum, a phylogenetically closely related bacterium responsible for malignant edema. In order to exclude false-negative results, an internal amplification control was included in the assay. A set of three probes, one specific for C. chauvoei, one specific for C. septicum, and one specific for both species, permitted unequivocal detection of C. chauvoei in tests of 32 Clostridium sp. strains and 10 non-Clostridium strains. The assay proved to be sensitive, detecting one genome of C. chauvoei or C. septicum per PCR and 1.79 x 10(3) C. chauvoei cells/g artificially contaminated muscle tissue. In tests of 11 clinical specimens, the real-time PCR assay yielded the same results as an established conventional PCR method.
TI  - Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from sludge treating brewery wastewater.
AB  - A spore-forming anaerobic bacterium, designated strain P6(T), was isolated from the sludge of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater. Cells were Gram-positive, oval and 0.6-0.9 mum by 1.2-1.8 mum in size. Growth was observed at 20-42 degrees C and at pH 5.0-7.5. It fermented several hexoses, polysaccharides and alcohols. Sucrose and aesculin could also be fermented. The main end products of fermentation from glucose were acetate, lactate and fumarate; trace CO(2) and H(2) were also produced. The DNA G+C content of strain P6(T) was 55.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(14 : 0) 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain P6(T) represented a novel phyletic sublineage in clostridial cluster III, and showed <91 % similarity to the type strains of recognized species in this cluster. Phenotypically, the new isolate was distinguished from its phylogenetic relatives (e.g. Clostridium straminisolvens, Clostridium thermocellum, Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Clostridium aldrichii) by producing acid from glucose and its inability to degrade cellulose. On the basis of evidence from this polyphasic study, strain P6(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Saccharofermentans acetigenes is P6(T) (=JCM 14006(T) =AS 1.5064(T)).
TI  - Quantitative real time PCR detection of Clostridium difficile growth inhibition by probiotic organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic microorganisms are potential treatments for Clostridium difficile diarrheal disease (CDD) but better methods are needed to determine the relative potency of probiotic microorganisms against pathogenic organisms in mixed cultures. AIM: Quantify C. difficile in the presence of putative probiotic organisms using molecular methods to determine relative probiotic potency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C. difficile strains were cultivated anaerobically. Serial dilutions of Lactobacillus cultures or microbial mixtures from kefir were co-cultured with C. difficile for 48 hours. Bacterial DNA was extracted and qPCR was used to measure C. difficile toxin A gene, on the basis of cycle threshold (Ct) number. RESULTS: Strains of Lactobacillus (human and ATCC derived), and mixed cultures from commercial kefir were co-cultured with C. difficile. Lactobacillus and the microbial mixture from kefir were ranked in order of their potency in C. difficile growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PCR allows facile quantification of C. difficle in the presence of other. The technique measures relative potency of over-the-counter probiotics and may predict human strains meriting probiotic status.
TI  - Expanding the family of collagen proteins: recombinant bacterial collagens of varying composition form triple-helices of similar stability.
AB  - The presence of the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) open reading frames in different bacteria predicts the existence of an expanded family of collagen-like proteins. To further explore the triple-helix motif and stabilization mechanisms in the absence of hydroxyproline (Hyp), predicted novel collagen-like proteins from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. Soluble proteins capable of successful folding and in vitro refolding were observed for collagen proteins from Methylobacterium sp 4-46, Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Solibacter usitatus . In contrast, all protein constructs from Clostridium perfringens were found predominantly in inclusion bodies. However, attachment of a heterologous N-terminal or C-terminal noncollagenous folding domain induced the Clostridium perfringens collagen domain to fold and become soluble. The soluble constructs from different bacteria had typical collagen triple-helical features and showed surprisingly similar thermal stabilities despite diverse amino acid compositions. These collagen-like proteins provide a resource for the development of biomaterials with new properties.
TI  - Composition and dynamics of sulfate-reducing bacteria during the waterflooding process in the oil field application.
AB  - The composition and dynamics of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) during the waterflooding process of Daqing Oilfield were investigated in this study. PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the microbial communities were significantly different in each treatment unit, and the dominant members were mainly close to Clostridium sp., Thauera sp., Hydrogenophaga sp., Pseudomonas sp., Eubacterium sp. and Arcobacter sp. However, the members belonging to SRB were relatively few and mainly consisted of Desulfovibrio sp. and Desulfovibrio profundus. According to APS (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase) gene clone library and sequence analysis, it was found that SRB mainly belonged to Proteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria. In the library, the genus Desulfovibrio of Deltaproteobacteria was about 65.2% while genus Desulfomonas, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfohalobium, Desulfonatronum, Desulfbulbus, Desulforhopalus, Desulfnema and Desulforhopalus were occupied nearly 34.8%. It was also proved that most of SRB in the oil field were enriched in the ground treatment unit and they are not in the liquid of oil well.
TI  - [Effects of microbial agent inoculation on bacterial community diversity in the process of pig manure composting].
AB  - PCR-DGGE method was adopted to study the effects of inoculating exogenous microbial agent on the bacterial community diversity in the process of fresh pig manure high-temperature aerobic composting. Exogenous microbial agent inoculation promoted the composting process, with the high-temperature period being advanced by 2 days than that of non-inoculation. DGGE pattern analysis showed that during composting, the dominant bacteria changed significantly, with the Shannon-Wiener index of bacterial community at different composting periods varied obviously. The sequencing of DGGE-distinguished bands showed that Clostridium stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum sp. was the dominant group in the whole composting process. Uncultured bacteria Bacillus coagulans sp. and Clostridium thermocellum sp. became the main groups on the 10th and 16th day after microbial agent inoculation, while uncultured Firmicutes sp. and delta proteobacterium became the dominant groups on the 5th and 16th days in the treatment non-inoculation, respectively. Un-dominant group Ureibacillus thermosphaericu sp. and uncultured Silvimonas sp. appeared in the late period of well rotted composting, while uncultured soil bacteria mainly appeared in the initial and high-temperature periods. UPGMC cluster analysis showed that exogenous microbial agent inoculation obviously affected the bacterial community structure in different composting periods, and the main component analysis of DGGE patterns in composting process showed that the bacterial community was mainly affected by the exogenous microbial agent inoculation.
TI  - Biosynthesis of polylactic acid and its copolymers using evolved propionate CoA transferase and PHA synthase.
AB  - For the synthesis of polylactic acid (PLA) and its copolymers by one-step fermentation process, heterologous pathways involving Clostridium propionicum propionate CoA transferase (Pct(Cp)) and Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase 1 (PhaC1(Ps6-19)) were introduced into Escherichia coli for the generation of lactyl-CoA endogenously and incorporation of lactyl-CoA into the polymer, respectively. Since the wild-type PhaC1(Ps6-19) did not efficiently accept lactyl-CoA as a substrate, site directed mutagenesis as well as saturation mutagenesis were performed to improve the enzyme. The wild-type Pct(Cp) was not able to efficiently convert lactate to lactyl-CoA and was found to exert inhibitory effect on cell growth, random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR was carried out. By employing engineered PhaC1(Ps6-19) and Pct(Cp), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate), P(3HB-co-LA), containing 20-49 mol% lactate could be produced up to 62 wt% from glucose and 3HB. By controlling the 3HB concentration in the medium, PLA homopolymer and P(3HB-co-LA) containing lactate as a major monomer unit could be synthesized. Also, P(3HB-co-LA) copolymers containing various lactate fractions could be produced from glucose alone by introducing the Cupriavidus necator beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase genes. Fed-batch cultures were performed to produce P(3HB-co-LA) copolymers having 9-64 mol% of lactate, and their molecular weights, thermal properties, and melt flow properties were determined.
TI  - Clostridium arbusti sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from pear orchard soil.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterial strain, designated SL206(T), was isolated from pear orchard soils. Strain SL206(T) cells were straight or slightly curved rods, with motility by peritrichate flagella. Cell walls contained meso-diaminopimelic acid; wall sugars were glucose, rhamnose and mannose. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0), C(18 : 1)omega9c and summed feature 10 (containing C(18 : 1)omega11c/9t/6t). API 20A reactions were negative for oxidase, catalase and acid production from l-rhamnose, sucrose, trehalose, d-xylose, melezitose, salicin and d-sorbitol, and positive for acid production from d-glucose, sucrose, maltose, d-mannose and raffinose. Glucose was fermented to acetate, butyrate, CO(2), H(2) and ethanol in culture. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31.1 mol%. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate belonged to the genus Clostridium and formed a clade with Clostridium pasteurianum. The species most closely related to strain SL206(T) were C. pasteurianum (98.6 % similarity) and Clostridium acidisoli (97.8 % similarity). In DNA-DNA relatedness studies, the isolate had 59.5 % relatedness with C. pasteurianum and thus represented a unique species. On the basis of these studies, strain SL206(T) (=KCTC 5449(T) =JCM 14858(T)) is proposed to represent the type strain of a novel species, Clostridium arbusti sp. nov.
TI  - Fed-batch production of tetanus toxin by Clostridium tetani.
AB  - This study deals with the effects of the initial nitrogen source (NZ Case TT) level and the protocol of glucose addition during the fed-batch production of tetanus toxin by Clostridium tetani. An increase in the initial concentration of NZ Case TT (NZ(0)) accelerated cell growth, increased the consumption of the nitrogen source as well as the final yield of tetanus toxin, which achieved the highest values (50-60 L(f)/mL) for NZ(0) > or = 50 g/L. The addition of glucose at fixed times (16, 56, and 88 h) ensured a toxin yield ( approximately 60 L(f)/mL) about 33% higher than those of fed-batch runs with addition at fixed concentration ( approximately 45 L(f)/mL) and about 300% higher than those obtained in reference batch runs nowadays used at industrial scale. The results of this work promise to substantially improve the present production of tetanus toxin and may be adopted for human vaccine production after detoxification and purification.

TI  - Treatment of septicaemia and severe bacterial infections in foals with a new cefquinome formulation: a field study.
AB  - A multicentre field study was conducted in accordance with VICH Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (VICH 2000) to confirm the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of cefquinome for the treatment of naturally occurring severe bacterial infections and septicaemia in foals. Thirty-nine foals suffering from severe bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, gastro-enteritis, arthritis, omphalitis, or wound infections) or acute septicaemia were treated twice daily with the test product (1 mg cefquinome/kg body weight) intravenously for three days and then intramuscularly for three to 11 days. Investigators examined the foals daily and scored both systemic and local clinical signs to assess the response to treatment, treatment success and relapses. On the day of inclusion a blood sample was taken from each foal for IgG determination and blood culture. In case of abnormal clinical findings additional samples were taken for bacteriology. Treatment was successful in 87.2% of cases (34 of 39 foals) and no relapses were observed. The average duration of treatment was 7.5 days. At inclusion, bacterial culture was positive in 40.5% (15 out of 37) of the blood cultures. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus spp. were the most common isolates and were all susceptible to cefquinome. E. coli predominated in swabs from umbilical and open wound infections, and in rectal swabs E. coli. There was no correlation between IgG at inclusion and study outcome or treatment duration. The test product was very well tolerated by all of the foals following intravenous and intramuscular injection. The cefquinome formulation tested was effective and safe in the treatment of severe bacterial infections and septicaemia in foals under field conditions.
TI  - [Screening and characteristics of normal temperature lignocellulose-degradation microbial community].
AB  - A normal temperature lignocellulose-degrading microflora has been constructed by  our laboratory. We researched the degradation activity and compose of the community in 28 degrees C fermentation condition. The results showed that the microbial community could degrade 39.6% of rice stew gross weight within five days.The volatile products were detected using CP-Chirasil-Dex CB capillary column by GC-MS, propionic acid, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, 4-amino-1-butanol, butanoic acid, diethoxydimethyl-silane, lactic acid, ethanol,2,2'-oxybis-, diethyl phthalate and glycerin,more than 10 kinds of volatile products were detected. The state volatile products of changed largely along with the process of decompose, the productions gradually increase, and the content changes much with the process of decompose. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) detected the dynamic change of bacterium compose, the bacterium changes much in different period,the result of Blast from 16S rDNA sequence was found that the closest relative in community belong to Clostridium sp., Brevibacillus sp., Rhizobium sp., Bacterium sp. four genera.
TI  - PKA and Epac cooperate to augment bradykinin-induced interleukin-8 release from human airway smooth muscle cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway smooth muscle contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases by secreting inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 production is in part regulated via activation of Gq-and Gs-coupled receptors. Here we study the role of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) effectors protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2) in the bradykinin-induced IL-8 release from a human airway smooth muscle cell line and the underlying molecular mechanisms of this response. METHODS: IL-8 release was assessed via ELISA under basal condition and after stimulation with bradykinin alone or in combination with fenoterol, the Epac activators 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP and Sp-8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMPS, the PKA activator 6-Bnz-cAMP and the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cGMP. Where indicated, cells were pre-incubated with the pharmacological inhibitors Clostridium difficile toxin B-1470 (GTPases), U0126 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2) and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS (PKA). The specificity of the cyclic nucleotide analogs was confirmed by measuring phosphorylation of the PKA substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. GTP-loading of Rap1 and Rap2 was evaluated via pull-down technique. Expression of Rap1, Rap2, Epac1 and Epac2 was assessed via western blot. Downregulation of Epac protein expression was achieved by siRNA. Unpaired or paired two-tailed Student's t test was used. RESULTS: The beta2-agonist fenoterol augmented release of IL-8 by bradykinin. The PKA activator 6-Bnz-cAMP and the Epac activator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP significantly increased bradykinin-induced IL-8 release. The hydrolysis-resistant Epac activator Sp-8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMPS mimicked the effects of 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, whereas the negative control 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cGMP did not. Fenoterol, forskolin and 6-Bnz-cAMP induced VASP phosphorylation, which was diminished by the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS. 6-Bnz-cAMP and 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP induced GTP-loading of Rap1, but not of Rap2. Treatment of the cells with toxin B-1470 and U0126 significantly reduced bradykinin-induced IL-8 release alone or in combination with the activators of PKA and Epac. Interestingly, inhibition of PKA by Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS and silencing of Epac1 and Epac2 expression by specific siRNAs largely decreased activation of Rap1 and the augmentation of bradykinin-induced IL-8 release by both PKA and Epac. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest that PKA, Epac1 and Epac2 act in concert to modulate inflammatory properties of airway smooth muscle via signaling to the Ras-like GTPase Rap1 and to ERK1/2.
TI  - Chronic hepatitis, hepatic dysplasia, fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia in hamsters naturally infected with a novel Helicobacter classified in the H. bilis cluster.
AB  - We recently described helicobacter-associated progressive, proliferative, and dysplastic typhlocolitis in aging (18- to 24-month-old) Syrian hamsters. Other pathogens associated with typhlocolitis in hamsters, Clostridium difficile, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Giardia spp., were not indentified. The presence of Helicobacter genus-specific DNA was noted by PCR in cecal and paraffin-embedded liver samples from aged hamsters by the use of Helicobacter-specific PCR primers. By 16S rRNA analysis, the Helicobacter sp. isolated from the liver tissue was identical to the cecal isolates from hamsters. The six hamster 16S rRNA sequences form a genotypic cluster most closely related to Helicobacter sp. Flexispira taxon 8, part of the Helicobacter bilis/H. cinaedi group. Livers from aged helicobacter-infected hamsters showed various stages of predominantly portocentric and, to a lesser extent, perivenular fibrosis. Within nodules, there was cellular atypia consistent with nodular dysplasia. The livers also exhibited a range of chronic active portal/interface and lobular inflammation, with significant portal hepatitis being present. The inflammation was composed of a mixture of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, indicative of its chronic-active nature in these aged hamsters infected with Helicobacter spp. The isolation of novel Helicobacter spp., their identification by PCR from the diseased livers of aged hamsters, and their taxonomic classification as belonging to the Helicobacter bilis cluster strengthen the argument that H. bilis and closely related Helicobacter spp. play an etiological role in hepatobiliary disease in both animals and humans.
TI  - Fervidicella metallireducens gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium from geothermal waters.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium, designated strain AeB(T), was isolated from microbial mats colonizing a run-off channel formed by free-flowing thermal water from a bore well (registered number 17263) of the Great Artesian Basin, Australia. Cells of strain AeB(T) were slightly curved rods (2.5-6.0x1.0 mum) that stained Gram-negative and formed spherical terminal to subterminal spores. The strain grew optimally in tryptone-yeast extract-Casamino acids medium at 50 degrees C (range 37-55 degrees C) and pH 7 (range pH 5-9). Strain AeB(T) grew poorly on yeast extract (0.2 %) and tryptone (0.2 %) as sole carbon sources, which were obligately required for growth on other energy sources. Growth of strain AeB(T) increased in the presence of various carbohydrates and amino acids, but not organic acids. End products detected from glucose fermentation were ethanol, acetate, CO2 and H2. In the presence of 0.2 % yeast extract, iron(III), manganese(IV), vanadium(V) and cobalt(III) were reduced, but not sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur, nitrate or nitrite. Iron(III) was also reduced in the presence of tryptone, peptone, Casamino acids and amyl media (Research Achievement), but not starch, xylan, chitin, glycerol, ethanol, pyruvate, benzoate, lactate, acetate, propionate, succinate, glycine, serine, lysine, threonine, arginine, glutamate, valine, leucine, histidine, alanine, aspartate, isoleucine or methionine. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, penicillin, ampicillin and NaCl concentrations >2 %. The DNA G+C content was 35.4+/-1 mol%, as determined by the thermal denaturation method. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain AeB(T) is a member of the family Clostridiaceae, class Clostridia, phylum 'Firmicutes', and is positioned approximately equidistantly between the genera Sarcina, Anaerobacter, Caloramator and Clostridium (16S rRNA gene similarity values of 87.8-90.9 %). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and physiological characteristics, strain AeB(T) is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Fervidicella metallireducens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is AeB(T) (=JCM 15555(T)=KCTC 5667(T)).
TI  - Murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a Gram-stain-positive, anaerobic coccus isolated from human wound specimens.
AB  - Two strains of previously unknown Gram-stain-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria from human wound specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies and distinguishable biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these two unknown strains, WAL 1855C(T) and WAL 2038E, are genotypically homogeneous and constitute a novel lineage within Clostridium cluster XIII. There was 13-14 % 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence between the novel strains and the most closely related species, Parvimonas micra, Finegoldia magna and species of Helcococcus. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a novel genus and species, Murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. Strain WAL 1855C(T) (=ATCC BAA-1631(T) =CCUG 55976(T)) is the type strain of Murdochiella asaccharolytica.
TI  - Anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium from Clostridium cluster XIVa isolated from broiler chicken caecal content, and emended description of the genus Anaerostipes.
AB  - Four butyrate-producing isolates were obtained from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined and confirmed the close relatedness of the four isolates, which suggested that they were derived from a single bacterial clone. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that its closest relatives were members of cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum of Gram-positive bacteria and that the closest related type strain was Anaerostipes caccae L1-92(T) (94.5 % similarity). Similarity levels of 96-98 % with sequences from uncultured bacteria from human stool samples were observed. On the basis of morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, this strain is assigned to a novel species in the genus Anaerostipes, for which the name Anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 35-7(T) (=LMG 24724(T) =DSM 22094(T)). An emended description of the genus Anaerostipes is also provided.
TI  - Cellulosilyticum ruminicola gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the rumen of yak,  and reclassification of Clostridium lentocellum as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov.
AB  - An obligate anaerobic, Gram-staining-negative, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain H1(T), was isolated from the rumen content of yak. Cells were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.8-1.0 x 3.0-4.0 microm in size, non-motile and encapsulated with mucous materials. Elliptical and terminal spores that swelled the cells were produced occasionally. The strain grew at 25-45 degrees C (optimum, 38 degrees C) and pH 6.0-7.8 (optimum, pH 6.7). Cellulose, cellobiose, xylan, xylose and maltose were used as carbon and energy sources, but not glucose. Products from cellulose and cellobiose fermentation were formic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide and trace amounts of ethanol, lactic acid and succinic acid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 33.7+/-1.2 mol%. The predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (27.1 %), C(14 : 0) (9.2 %) and iso-C( 16 : 0) (6.4%). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain H1(T) was affiliated to the clostridial rRNA cluster XIVb and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Clostridium lentocellum DSM 5427(T) (96.0 %). These two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family 'Lachnospiraceae '. Based on data from this polyphasic taxonomic study, a new genus, Cellulosilyticum gen. nov., is proposed. Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is proposed for strain H1(T). The type strain of Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is strain H1(T) (=CGMCC 1.5065(T)=JCM 14822(T)). Clostridium lentocellum was reclassified in the new genus as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov. (type strain RHM5(T)=ATCC 49066( T)=DSM 5427(T)=NCIMB 11756(T)).
TI  - Clostridium hydrogeniformans sp. nov. and Clostridium cavendishii sp. nov., hydrogen-producing bacteria from chlorinated solvent-contaminated groundwater.
AB  - Four hydrogen-producing, aerotolerant, anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from  chlorinated solvent-contaminated groundwater were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Three of the strains, designated BL-18, BL-19 and BL-20(T), were found to be identical in 16S rRNA gene sequences and in phenotypic properties. Cells of these strains are Gram-positive-staining, spore-forming, motile rods with peritrichous flagella. Growth occurred at 15-40 degrees C, pH 5.0-10.0 and at NaCl concentrations up to 5 % (w/v). Acid was produced in fermentation of cellobiose, fructose, galactose (weak), glucose, maltose and salicin. Products of fermentation in PYG medium were acetate, butyrate, ethanol, formate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Dominant cellular fatty acids when grown in PYG medium were C(13 : 0) iso, C(16 : 0), C(13 : 0) anteiso, C(15 : 0) iso and C(15 : 0) anteiso. The genomic DNA G+C content was 30.4 mol%. These isolates can be differentiated from their closest phylogenetic relative, the cluster I Clostridium species Clostridium frigidicarnis (97.2 % similar to the type strain in 16S rRNA gene sequence), on the basis of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties. The other strain characterized in this study, BL-28(T), was Gram-positive-staining with spore-forming, rod-shaped cells. Growth occurred at 15-46 degrees C, pH 6.0-8.5 and at NaCl concentrations up to 3 % (w/v). Acid was produced from cellobiose, dextran, fructose (weak), glucose, maltose, salicin and trehalose. End products of PYG fermentation included acetate, butyrate, pyruvate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Dominant cellular fatty acids from cells grown in PYG medium at 30 degrees C were C(14 : 0), C(14 : 0) dimethyl aldehyde, C(16 : 0) and C(12 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 28.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain BL-28(T) falls within cluster I of the genus Clostridium, but with <or=95.2 % identity with previously described species. On the basis of results presented here, strains BL-20(T) (=NRRL B-51348(T) =DSM 21757(T)) and BL-28(T) (=NRRL B-51352(T) =DSM 21758(T)) are proposed as the type strains of novel species of the genus Clostridium with the names Clostridium hydrogeniformans sp. nov. and Clostridium cavendishii sp. nov., respectively.
TI  - Characterization of bacteria, clostridia and Bacteroides in faeces of vegetarians using qPCR and PCR-DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes of bacteria, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium cluster IV in faecal microbiota associated with a vegetarian diet. METHODS: Bacterial abundances were measured in faecal samples of 15 vegetarians and 14 omnivores using quantitative PCR. Diversity was assessed with PCR-DGGE fingerprinting, principal component analysis (PCA) and Shannon diversity index. RESULTS: Vegetarians had a 12% higher abundance of bacterial DNA than omnivores, a tendency for less Clostridium cluster IV (31.86 +/- 17.00%; 36.64 +/- 14.22%) and higher abundance of Bacteroides (23.93 +/- 10.35%; 21.26 +/- 8.05%), which were not significant due to high interindividual variations. PCA suggested a grouping of bacteria and members of Clostridium cluster IV. Two bands appeared significantly more frequently in omnivores than in vegetarians (p < 0.005 and p < 0.022). One was identified as Faecalibacterium sp. and the other was 97.9% similar to the uncultured gut bacteriumDQ793301. CONCLUSIONS: A vegetarian diet affects the intestinal microbiota, especially by decreasing the amount and changing the diversity of Clostridium cluster IV. It remains to be determined how these shifts might affect the host metabolism and disease risks.
TI  - Bacterial communities in PAH contaminated soils at an electronic-waste processing center in China.
AB  - Surface soils from Guiyu, China (an intense e-waste processing center) were analyzed for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and variations in composition of the resident bacterial communities. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene showed that e-waste pollution altered the bacterial community structure by promoting changes in species composition and species richness. Bacterial diversity was not decreased at e-waste open-burning sites, compared with a non e-waste site (reservoir site), due to flourishing of possible POPs-consuming bacterial cohorts. PAH-incubated experiments confirmed that different levels of PAHs might affect the bacterial community by suppressing or favoring certain groups of bacteria, for instance, uncultured Clostridium sp. and Massilia sp., respectively. Taxonomic analysis indicated beta-proteobacteria and Firmicutes were abundant bacterial lineages in PAH-polluted soils. This study is the first reporting bacterial community structures at e-waste processing sites, and indicated that crude processing of e-waste has become a biohazard to the terrestrial environment warranting more extensive studies of microbial communities at e-waste polluted environments.
TI  - Proteocatella sphenisci gen. nov., sp. nov., a psychrotolerant, spore-forming anaerobe isolated from penguin guano.
AB  - A novel, obligately anaerobic, psychrotolerant bacterium, designated strain PPP2T, was isolated from guano of the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Chilean Patagonia. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, spore-forming, straight rods (0.7-0.8x3.0-5.0 microm) that were motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Growth was observed at pH 6.7-9.7 (optimum pH 8.3) and 2-37 degrees C (optimum 29 degrees C). Growth was observed between 0 and 4% (w/v) NaCl with optimum growth at 0.5% (w/v). Strain PPP2T was a catalase-negative chemo-organoheterotroph that was capable of fermentative metabolism. Peptone, bacto-tryptone, Casamino acids, oxalate, starch, chitin and yeast extract were utilized as substrates. The major metabolic products were acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Strain PPP2T was resistant to ampicillin, but sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, kanamycin, vancomycin and gentamicin. The DNA G+C content of strain PPP2T was 39.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain PPP2T was related most closely to Clostridium sticklandii SR (approximately 90% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, strain PPP2T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Proteocatella sphenisci gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Proteocatella sphenisci is PPP2T (=ATCC BAA-755T=JCM 12175T=CIP 108034T).
TI  - Stimulation of biomethanation by Clostridium sp. PXYL1 in coculture with a Methanosarcina strain PMET1 at psychrophilic temperatures.
AB  - AIM: Bioaugumentation of low temperature biogas production was attempted by addition of cold-adapted Clostridium and a methanogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: A psychrotrophic xylanolytic acetogenic strain Clostridium sp. PXYL1 growing optimally at 20 degrees C and pH 5.3 and a Methanosarcina strain, PMET1, growing optimally on acetate and producing methane at 15 degrees C were isolated from a cattle manure digester. Anaerobic conversion of xylose at 15 degrees C with the coculture of the two strains was performed, and batch culture methane production characteristics indicated that methanogenesis occurred via acetate through 'acetoclastic' pathway. Stimulation studies were also undertaken to evaluate the effect of exogenous addition of the coculture on biogas yields at 15 degrees C. Addition of 3 ml of PXYL1 at the rate of 12 x 10(2) CFU ml(-1) increased the biogas 1.7-fold (33 l per kg cowdung) when compared to control (19.3 l per kg cowdung) as well as increased the volatile fatty acid (VFA) levels to 3210 mg l(-1) when compared to 1140 mg l(-1) in controls. Exogenous of addition of 10 ml PMET1 inoculum at the rate of 6.8 + or - 10(2) CFU ml(-1) in addition to PXYL1 served to further improve the biogas yields to 46 l kg(-1) as well as significantly brought down the VFA levels to 1350 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the rate-limiting methanogenic step at low temperatures could be overcome and that biogas yields improved by manipulating the population of the acetoclastic methanogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Stimulation of biomethanation at low temperature by coculture.
TI  - Effects of selected pectinolytic bacterial strains on water-retting of hemp and fibre properties.
AB  - AIMS: To study the effect of selected bacterial strains on hemp water-retting and properties of retted fibre. METHODS AND RESULTS: The trials were performed in laboratory tanks. The traditional water-retting process, without inoculum addition, was compared to a process modified by inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic bacteria: the anaerobic strain Clostridium sp. L1/6 and the aerobic strain Bacillus sp. ROO40B. Six different incubation times were compared. Half the fibre obtained from each tank was combed. Micromorphological analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy on uncombed and combed fibres. Moreover, organoleptic and chemical analyses of uncombed fibres were performed. CONCLUSIONS: The inoculum, besides speeding up the process, significantly improved the fibre quality. The fibre was not damaged by mechanical hackling, thanks to the good retting level obtained by the addition of selected strains, differently to what happened with the traditionally retted fibre. The best fibre quality was obtained after 3-4 days of retting with the addition of the bacterial inoculum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Retting is the major limitation to an efficient production of high-quality hemp fibres. The water-retting process and fibre quality were substantially improved by simultaneously inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic strains.
TI  - Clostridium clariflavum sp. nov. and Clostridium caenicola sp. nov., moderately thermophilic, cellulose-/cellobiose-digesting bacteria isolated from methanogenic sludge.
AB  - Two novel anaerobic, moderately thermophilic and cellulose-/cellobiose-digesting  bacteria, EBR45(T) and EBR596(T), were isolated from anaerobic sludge of a cellulose-degrading methanogenic bioreactor. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains belonged to cluster III within the low-G+C-content Gram-positive bacteria. The close relatives of EBR45(T) were Clostridium straminisolvens DSM 16021(T) (sequence identity, 94.6 %) and Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1237(T) (93.4 %). The closest relative of EBR596(T) was Clostridium stercorarium DSM 8532(T) (95.9 %). Both isolates were rod-shaped sporulators, growing optimally at 60 degrees C. EBR45(T) was Gram-staining-reaction-variable and non-motile, formed bright-yellow colonies on solid media, and grew on a relatively narrow range of carbohydrates including cellulose and cellobiose. EBR596(T) was Gram-staining-reaction-negative and motile, formed glossy white colonies and grew on cellobiose and various carbohydrates except cellulose. Major fatty acid compositions were 16 : 0 iso, 16 : 0 and 16 : 0 dimethylacetal (strain EBR45(T)) and 15 : 0 iso, 16 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 anteiso and 17 : 0 anteiso (strain EBR596(T)). The DNA G+C contents were 36.9 mol% (EBR45(T)) and 51.1 mol% (EBR596(T)). Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic data and genomic distinctiveness, strains EBR45(T) and EBR596(T) represent two novel species, for which the names Clostridium clariflavum sp. nov. (type strain EBR45(T) =DSM 19732(T) =NBRC 101661(T)) and Clostridium caenicola sp. nov. (type strain EBR596(T) =DSM 19027(T) =NBRC 102590(T)) are proposed.
TI  - Clostridium sulfidigenes sp. nov., a mesophilic, proteolytic, thiosulfate- and sulfur-reducing bacterium isolated from pond sediment.
AB  - A novel strictly anaerobic, endospore-forming, rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium, designated strain SGB2(T), was isolated from a mixed culture from a pond sediment during screening for sulfate-reducing bacteria capable of degrading cyanophycin (CGP). In this study, the taxonomic characterization of this mesophilic, proteolytic Clostridium isolate and the role which it, and its phylogenetic relatives, may play in peptide degradation and in the sulfur cycle are reported. Strain SGB2(T) was a commensal strain, utilizing CGP degradation products produced by other micro-organisms. Cells were motile until sporulation, forming oval, terminal spores that swell the cells. It showed optimum growth at 34 degrees C, pH 6.6 and in the absence of NaCl. Strain SGB2(T) utilized proteinaceous compounds such as peptone, Casamino acids, gelatin and trypticase soy, in addition to several amino acids and pyruvate. Utilization of many of these compounds was enhanced in the presence of thiosulfate. The isolate was unable to use any of the carbohydrates or alcohols investigated or CGP as carbon and energy sources. Thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were used as terminal electron acceptors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain SGB2(T) belongs to the low-G+C-containing Clostridiales group. It exhibited 99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to its closest relatives Clostridium thiosulfatireducens Lup21(T) and Clostridium subterminale DSM 6970(T). DNA-DNA hybridization values with these two strains were 39.4 and 42.1 %, respectively. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, we conclude that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium sulfidigenes sp. nov. The type strain is SGB2(T) (=DSM 18982(T) =ATCC BAA-1538(T)).
TI  - An electron-flow model can predict complex redox reactions in mixed-culture fermentative bioH2: microbial ecology evidence.
AB  - We developed the first model for predicting community structure in mixed-culture  fermentative biohydrogen production using electron flows and NADH2 balances. A key assumption of the model is that H2 is produced only via the pyruvate decarboxylation-ferredoxin-hydrogenase pathway, which is commonly the case for fermentation by Clostridium and Ethanoligenens species. We experimentally tested the model using clone libraries to gauge community structures with mixed cultures in which we did not pre-select for specific bacterial groups, such as spore-formers. For experiments having final pHs 3.5 and 4.0, where H2 yield and soluble end-product distribution were distinctly different, we established stoichiometric reactions for each condition by using experimentally determined electron equivalent balances. The error in electron balancing was only 3% at final pH 3.5, in which butyrate and acetate were dominant organic products and the H2 yield was 2.1 mol H2/mol glucose. Clone-library analysis showed that clones affiliated with Clostridium sp. BL-22 and Clostridium sp. HPB-16 were dominant at final pH 3.5. For final pH 4.0, the H2 yield was 0.9 mol H2/mol glucose, ethanol, and acetate were the dominant organic products, and the electron balance error was 13%. The significant error indicates that a second pathway for H2 generation was active. The most abundant clones were affiliated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which uses the formate-cleavage pathway for H2 production. Thus, the clone-library analyses confirmed that the model predictions for when the pyruvate decarboxylation-ferredoxin-hydrogenase pathway was (final pH 3.5) or was not (final pH 4.0) dominant. With the electron-flow model, we can easily assess the main mechanisms for H2 formation and the dominant H2-producing bacteria in mixed-culture fermentative bioH2.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Characterization of the central metabolic pathways in Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 via isotopomer-assisted metabolite analysis.
AB  - Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514 has great potential in biotechnology due to its capacity to ferment a range of C(5) and C(6) sugars to ethanol and other metabolites under thermophilic conditions. This study investigated the central metabolism of strain X514 via (13)C-labeled tracer experiments using either glucose or pyruvate as both carbon and energy sources. X514 grew on minimal medium and thus contains complete biosynthesis pathways for all macromolecule building blocks. Based on genome annotation and isotopic analysis of amino acids, three observations can be obtained about the central metabolic pathways in X514. First, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in X514 is not functional, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete under fermentative growth conditions. Second, X514 contains (Re)-type citrate synthase activity, although no gene homologous to the recently characterized (Re)-type citrate synthase of Clostridium kluyveri was found. Third, the isoleucine in X514 is derived from acetyl coenzyme A and pyruvate via the citramalate pathway rather than being synthesized from threonine via threonine ammonia-lyase. The functionality of the citramalate synthase gene (cimA [Teth514_1204]) has been confirmed by enzymatic activity assays, while the presence of intracellular citramalate has been detected by mass spectrometry. This study demonstrates the merits of combining (13)C-assisted metabolite analysis, enzyme assays, and metabolite detection not only to examine genome sequence annotations but also to discover novel enzyme activities.
TI  - Clostridium tagluense sp. nov., a psychrotolerant, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium from permafrost.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, Gram-positive, psychrotolerant, endospore-forming bacterium (strain A121(T)) was isolated from a permafrost sample collected in the Canadian High Arctic. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain A121(T) showed its affiliation with the group of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant members of cluster I of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium bowmanii DSM 14206(T) being the closest relative (sequence similarity 98.5 %). Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain A121(T) and the type strains of phylogenetically related species ranged from 33 to 52 %. Strain A121(T) grew in PY broth at temperatures between 4 and 28 degrees C (optimum 15-20 degrees C), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 6.5-7.2) and in NaCl concentrations of 0-10.0 % (optimum 0-2.0 %). The strain utilized a narrow range of carbohydrates as sources of carbon and energy, including glucose, fructose, trehalose, maltose and starch; it also hydrolysed gelatin. Predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 1) cis9, C(16 : 1) cis9 DMA, C(16 : 0) and C(14 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 31.5 mol%. On the basis of its overall genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain A121(T) is classified within a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium tagluense sp. nov. The type strain is A121(T) (=VKM B-2369(T) =DSM 17763(T)).
TI  - Enhanced bio-energy recovery in a two-stage hydrogen/methane fermentation process.
AB  - A two-stage hydrogen/methane fermentation process has emerged as a feasible engineering system to recover bio-energy from wastewater. Hydrogen-producing bacteria (HPB) generate hydrogen from readily available carbohydrates, and organic acids produced during the hydrogen fermentation step can be degraded to generate methane in the following step. Three strong acids, HCl, H(2)SO(4), and HNO(3), were tested to determine the appropriate pre-treatment method for enhanced hydrogen production. The hydrogen production rates of 230, 290, and 20 L/kg(-glucose)/day was observed for the sludge treated with HCl, H(2)SO(4), and HNO(3), respectively, indicating that the acid pre-treatment using either HCl or H(2)SO(4) resulted in a significant increase in hydrogen production. The fluorescent in situ hybridization method indicated that the acid pre-treatment selectively enriched HPB including Clostridium sp. of cluster I from inoculum sludge. After hydrogen fermentation was terminated, the sludge was introduced to a methane fermentation reactor. This experiment showed methane production rates of 100, 30, and 13 L/kg(-glucose)/day for the sludge pre-treated with HCl, H(2)SO(4), and HNO(3), respectively, implying that both sulfate and nitrate inhibited the activity of methane-producing bacteria. Consequently, the acid pre-treatment might be a feasible option to enhance biogas recovery in the two-stage fermentation process, and HCl was selected as the optimal strong acid for the enrichment of HPB and the continuous production of methane.
TI  - Growth and mycotoxin production by food spoilage fungi under high carbon dioxide  and low oxygen atmospheres.
AB  - The influence of high carbon dioxide and low oxygen concentrations on growth by the foodborne fungal species, Mucor plumbeus, Fusarium oxysporum, Byssochlamys fulva, Byssochlamys nivea, Penicillium commune, Penicillium roqueforti, Aspergillus flavus, Eurotium chevalieri and Xeromyces bisporus was investigated. Production of aflatoxin by A. flavus, patulin by B. nivea and roquefortine C by P. roqueforti was also studied. Fungal growth was evaluated under atmospheres consisting of 20, 40 and 60% CO(2) plus <0.5% O(2), on two media, Czapek Yeast Extract agar and Potato Dextrose agar. Several methods for measuring fungal growth were used: colony diameter, ergosterol content, hyphal length and/or mycelium dry weight. Among the nine species, three groups were distinguished with respect to their growth responses under modified atmospheres: (i) species which did not grow in 20% CO(2) <0.5% O(2) (P. commune, E. chevalieri and X. bisporus); (ii) species which grew in 20% CO(2) <0.5% O(2), but not 40% CO(2) <0.5% O(2) (P. roqueforti and A. flavus); (iii) species which grew in 20%, 40% and 60% CO(2) <0.5% O(2) (M. plumbeus, F. oxysporum, B. fulva and B. nivea). Facultatively anaerobic behaviour was observed in these last four species, which grew under the same conditions as the obligate anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes. The production of aflatoxin, patulin, and roquefortine C was greatly reduced under all of the atmospheres tested.
TI  - Clostridium sufflavum sp. nov., isolated from a methanogenic reactor treating cattle waste.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterial strain, designated CDT-1(T), was isolated from rice-straw residue from a methanogenic reactor treating waste from cattle farms. The isolation was performed using enrichment culture with filter paper as a substrate. Cells stained Gram-negative, but reacted Gram-positively in the KOH test. Cells were slightly curved rods and were motile by means of peritrichous flagella. The strain produced yellow pigment when grown on filter-paper fragments. Although spore formation was not confirmed microscopically, thermotolerant cells were produced when the strain was grown on filter paper. The optimum temperature for growth was 33 degrees C and the optimum pH was 7.4. Oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were absent. The strain utilized xylose, fructose, glucose, cellobiose, xylooligosaccharide, cellulose (filter-paper fragments and ball-milled filter paper) and xylan. The major fermentation products were acetate, ethanol, H(2) and CO(2). The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(14 : 0) and C(16 : 0) DMA. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 40.7 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain CDT-1(T) could be placed in cluster III of the genus Clostridium, being closely related to type strains of Clostridium hungatei (96.6 % sequence similarity), Clostridium termitidis (96.2 %) and Clostridium papyrosolvens (96.1 %). On the basis of the cellular, physiological and phylogenetic differences between CDT-1(T) and its close relatives, this strain represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium sufflavum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CDT-1(T) (=JCM 14807(T)=DSM 19573(T)).
TI  - Case of Clostridium perfringens bacteremia after routine colonoscopy and polypectomy.
AB  - Bacteremia is an uncommon complication after polypectomy and colonoscopy. We report one of the first cases of Clostridium perfringens bacteremia after polypectomy. Our patient was a four years old boy with congenital polyposis, who underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy without complication. Approximately 12h later he developed a fever and tachycardia with no other clinical symptoms. His blood cultures grew out penicillin susceptible C. perfringens and Enterococcus faecalis. He responded to antibiotic therapy and remained clinically asymptomatic for the duration of his course. There are a few reports of bacteremia after routine polypectomy, but no reported cases of C. perfringens bacteremia in the pediatric population. Clostridial sp. bacteremia can be fatal with devastating consequences if appropriate antibiotics and/or surgical debridement are delayed. Polymicrobial infection, as illustrated in our patient, is also common and can be a poor prognostic risk factor. Therefore, for patients with a history of polypectomy and new onset fever, anaerobic infections should be considered and empiric antibiotic therapy should include coverage for these organisms.
TI  - Characterization of a microbial community capable of reducing perchlorate and nitrate in high salinity.
AB  - Denitrifying up-flow packed-bed bioreactors fed with perchlorate and nitrate allowed for the examination of the impact of a variety of salt conditions (up to 10% w/v NaCl) on the complete perchlorate and nitrate removal capacity of the reactor using activated sludge taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Based on the evaluation of the microbial community in the bioreactor by cloning analysis, Clostridium sp. and a Rhodocyclaceae bacteria were identified as the dominant clones. This suggests that they may be tolerant to high salt and can reduce both nitrate and perchlorate in such conditions.
TI  - Clostridium lavalense sp. nov., a glycopeptide-resistant species isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Two vancomycin-resistant, strictly anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms (strains CCRI-9842(T) and CCRI-9929) isolated from human faecal specimens in Quebec, Canada, and Australia were characterized using phenotypic, biochemical and molecular taxonomic methods. Pairwise analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that both strains were closely related to each other genetically (displaying 99.2 % sequence similarity) and represented a previously unknown subline within the Clostridium coccoides rRNA group of organisms (rRNA cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium). Strains CCRI-9842(T) and CCRI-9929 used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid as the major product of glucose metabolism. The novel strains were most closely related to Clostridium asparagiforme, Clostridium bolteae and Clostridium clostridioforme, but morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic studies demonstrated that they represent a previously unidentified species of the genus Clostridium. This was confirmed by the unique cellular fatty acid composition of strains CCRI-9842(T) and CCRI-9929. Therefore, on the basis of data from the polyphasic taxonomic analysis, it is proposed that strains CCRI-9842(T) and CCRI-9929 represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium lavalense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CCRI-9842(T) (=CCUG 54291(T)=JCM 14986(T)=NML 03-A-015(T)).
TI  - Functional expression of a bacterial xylose isomerase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - In industrial fermentation processes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used for ethanol production. However, it lacks the ability to ferment pentose sugars like d-xylose and l-arabinose. Heterologous expression of a xylose isomerase (XI) would enable yeast cells to metabolize xylose. However, many attempts to express a prokaryotic XI with high activity in S. cerevisiae have failed so far. We have screened nucleic acid databases for sequences encoding putative XIs and finally were able to clone and successfully express a highly active new kind of XI from the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans in S. cerevisiae. Heterologous expression of this enzyme confers on the yeast cells the ability to metabolize d-xylose and to use it as the sole carbon and energy source. The new enzyme has low sequence similarities to the XIs from Piromyces sp. strain E2 and Thermus thermophilus, which were the only two XIs previously functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae. The activity and kinetic parameters of the new enzyme are comparable to those of the Piromyces XI. Importantly, the new enzyme is far less inhibited by xylitol, which accrues as a side product during xylose fermentation. Furthermore, expression of the gene could be improved by adapting its codon usage to that of the highly expressed glycolytic genes of S. cerevisiae. Expression of the bacterial XI in an industrially employed yeast strain enabled it to grow on xylose and to ferment xylose to ethanol. Thus, our findings provide an excellent starting point for further improvement of xylose fermentation in industrial yeast strains.
TI  - Spore photoproduct lyase catalyzes specific repair of the 5R but not the 5S spore photoproduct.
AB  - Bacterial spores are remarkable in their resistance to chemical and physical stresses, including exposure to UV radiation. The unusual UV resistance of bacterial spores is a result of the unique photochemistry of spore DNA, which results in accumulation of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine (spore photoproduct, or SP), coupled with the efficient repair of accumulated damage by the enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (SPL). SPL is a member of the radical AdoMet superfamily of enzymes, and utilizes an iron-sulfur cluster and S-adenosylmethionine to repair SP by a direct reversal mechanism initiated by H atom abstraction from C-6 of the thymine dimer. While two distinct diastereomers of SP (5R or 5S) could in principle be formed upon UV irradiation of bacterial spores, only the 5R configuration is possible for SP formed from adjacent thymines in double helical DNA, due to the constraints imposed by the DNA structure; the 5S configuration is possible in less well-defined DNA structures or as an interstrand cross-link. We report here results from HPLC and MS analysis of in vitro enzymatic assays on stereochemically defined SP substrates demonstrating that SPL specifically repairs only the 5R isomer of SP. The observation that 5R-SP, but not 5S-SP, is a substrate for SPL is consistent with the expectation that 5R is the SP isomer produced in vivo upon UV irradiation of bacterial spore DNA.
TI  - Demonstration of passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis following immunization of pregnant heifers at 3 months of gestation.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is one of the primary etiologic agents for diarrhea in neonatal calves. Immunization of dams can provide passive protection in neonatal calves; antibodies transferred through colostrum block colonization of bacteria, thereby preventing disease. In this study, healthy pregnant heifers were vaccinated at approximately 3 months of gestation with either a polyvalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated coronavirus, rotavirus, E. coli K99 subunit antigen, and Clostridium perfringens b and e toxoid or normal saline as a placebo. Calves were allowed to nurse immediately after birth, were orally challenged with virulent heterologous enterotoxigenic E. coli at 1 day of age, and were observed for clinical signs of scours for 10 days. Signs of severe scours were noted in 75% of control calves and 28.6% of vaccinates, and the severity of scours was significantly higher (P = .0382) in the control group. The mortality rate was significantly higher (P = .0007) in the control group (80%) than in the vaccinate group (14%). These findings indicate that the vaccination of pregnant heifers at as early as 3 months of gestation (6 months before calving) provides passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis.
TI  - Regional differences in bacterial flora in harbour porpoises from the North Atlantic: environmental effects?
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological findings in harbour porpoises from different regions of the North Atlantic were compared. Results in animals from the North and Baltic Seas were evaluated over a period of 18 years for changes in the microbiological flora. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological investigations were performed on 1429 organ samples from the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes from harbour porpoises of the German North and Baltic Seas, Greenlandic, Icelandic and Norwegian waters. A large variety of bacteria, including potentially pathogenic bacteria like Brucella sp., Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. Those bacteria were associated with bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, myocarditis and septicemia. CONCLUSIONS: Organs from animals originating from Greenlandic and Icelandic waters showed clearly less bacterial growth and fewer associated pathological lesions compared to animals from the German North and Baltic Seas and Norwegian waters. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Differences in bacterial findings and associated lesions between harbour porpoises from the German North and Baltic Seas and animals from Greenlandic, Norwegian and Icelandic waters may result from higher stress due to anthropogenic activities such as chemical pollutants in the North and Baltic Seas.
TI  - Effect of the addition of ground rosemary on the quality and shelf-life of turkey meatballs during refrigerated storage.
AB  - 1. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the addition of ground rosemary on the quality and shelf-life of turkey meatballs. Heat-treated vacuum-packed turkey meatballs were stored at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. 2. The rate of oxidative and hydrolytic changes during refrigerated storage was slower in meatballs containing 1% of rosemary. The samples with rosemary were characterised by significantly lower values of pH and water activity than control samples. The addition of rosemary inhibited the growth of psychrotrophic, coliform and Clostridium sp. bacteria. 3. The sensory quality of meatballs decreased over storage, first in control samples and later also in those containing rosemary. Warmed-over flavour was detected after 12 d of storage in meatballs spiced with rosemary and after 3 d in control samples. A sour flavour was not perceptible in meatballs containing rosemary. The obtained results confirm the beneficial effect of rosemary added to poultry meat products.
TI  - Optimization strategies based on sequential quadratic programming applied for a fermentation process for butanol production.
AB  - In this work, the mathematical optimization of a continuous flash fermentation process for the production of biobutanol was studied. The process consists of three interconnected units, as follows: fermentor, cell-retention system (tangential microfiltration), and vacuum flash vessel (responsible for the continuous recovery of butanol from the broth). The objective of the optimization was to maximize butanol productivity for a desired substrate conversion. Two strategies were compared for the optimization of the process. In one of them, the process was represented by a deterministic model with kinetic parameters determined experimentally and, in the other, by a statistical model obtained using the factorial design technique combined with simulation. For both strategies, the problem was written as a nonlinear programming problem and was solved with the sequential quadratic programming technique. The results showed that despite the very similar solutions obtained with both strategies, the problems found with the strategy using the deterministic model, such as lack of convergence and high computational time, make the use of the optimization strategy with the statistical model, which showed to be robust and fast, more suitable for the flash fermentation process, being recommended for real-time applications coupling optimization and control.
TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from the caecal content of a broiler chicken.
AB  - Five isolates that produced large amounts of butyrate were obtained in the course of a study on the butyrate-producing microbiota from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. The five isolates were virtually indistinguishable in biochemical and genetic terms, suggesting that they were derived from a single bacterial clone colonizing this habitat. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the five isolates represented a unique lineage within the Clostridium leptum subgroup of the clostridia, with Eubacterium desmolans as the closest phylogenetic neighbour (about 93 % similarity). These data indicate that the five novel isolates represent a single novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum is 25-3(T) (=LMG 24109(T) =CCUG 55265(T)). The DNA G+C content of strain 25-3(T) was 54.5 mol% .
TI  - Sharpea azabuensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from the faeces of thoroughbred horses.
AB  - Four bacterial strains, designated ST18(T), HM244, HM250 and DI49, were isolated  from the fresh faeces of four thoroughbred horses in Japan. Cells were Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that occurred in chains. They were placed in the same subcluster based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, phenotypic characteristics and levels of DNA-DNA relatedness. Their DNA G+C content ranged from 36 to 38 mol%. Lactobacillus catenaformis, Lactobacillus vitulinus and Catenibacterium mitsuokai belong to cluster XVII of the Clostridium subphylum. Strain ST18(T) was most closely related to L. catenaformis ATCC 25536(T) in the phylogenetic tree, but these strains shared only 89.9 % (1336/1486 bp) 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. L. catenaformis, L. vitulinus and C. mitsuokai are homofermentative bacteria, whereas ST18(T) produced CO(2) from glucose. Whereas the cell-wall peptidoglycan type of L. catenaformis and L. vitulinus wasL-Lys-L-Ala(3), that of C. mitsuokai and the subgroup represented by ST18(T) was A1gamma (L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence of more than 10 % from L. catenaformis as well as phenotypic characteristics, strains ST18(T), HM244, HM250 and DI49 are considered to represent a novel species of a new genus belonging to the Clostridium subphylum cluster XVII, for which the name Sharpea azabuensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Sharpea azabuensis is ST18(T) (=JCM 14210(T) =DSM 18934(T)).
TI  - Thermoanaerobacter uzonensis sp. nov., an anaerobic thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring within the Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka, Far East Russia.
AB  - Several strains of heterotrophic, anaerobic thermophilic bacteria were isolated from hot springs of the Uzon Caldera, Kamchatka, Far East Russia. Strain JW/IW010(T) was isolated from a hot spring within the West sector of the Eastern Thermal field, near Pulsating Spring in the Winding Creek area. Cells of strain JW/IW010(T) were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.5 mum in width and variable in length from 2 to 5 mum and occasionally up to 15 mum, and formed oval subterminal spores. Cells stained Gram-negative, but were Gram-type positive. Growth was observed between 32.5 and 69 degrees C with an optimum around 61 degrees C (no growth occurred at or below 30 degrees C, or at or above 72 degrees C). The pH(60 degrees C) range for growth was 4.2-8.9 with an optimum at 7.1 (no growth occurred at or below pH(60 degrees C) 3.9, or at 9.2 or above). The shortest observed doubling-time at pH(60 degrees C) 6.9 and 61 degrees C was 30 min. Strain JW/IW010(T) was chemo-organotrophic; yeast extract, peptone, Casamino acids and tryptone supported growth. Yeast extract was necessary for the utilization of non-proteinaceous substrates, and growth was observed with inulin, cellobiose, maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, xylose, trehalose, mannitol, pyruvate and crotonate. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain JW/IW010(T) was 33.6 mol% (HPLC method). The major phospholipid fatty acids were iso-15 : 0 (53.5 %), 15 : 0 (11.8 %), 16 : 0 (7.3 %), 10-methyl 16 : 0 (7.3 %) and anteiso-15 : 0 (5.3 %). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed strain JW/IW010(T) in the genus Thermoanaerobacter of the family 'Thermoanaerobacteriaceae' (Firmicutes), with Thermoanaerobacter sulfurigignens JW/SL-NZ826(T) (97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Thermoanaerobacter kivui DSM 2030(T) (94.5 %) as the closest phylogenetic relatives with validly published names. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain JW/IW010(T) and Thermoanaerobacter sulfurigignens JW/SL-NZ826(T) was 64 %. Based on the physiological, phylogenetic and genotypic data, strain JW/IW010(T) represents a novel taxon, for which the name Thermoanaerobacter uzonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JW/IW010(T) (=ATCC BAA-1464(T)=DSM 18761(T)). The effectively published strain, 1501/60, of 'Clostridium uzonii' [Krivenko, V. V., Vadachloriya, R. M., Chermykh, N. A., Mityushina, L. L. & Krasilnikova, E. N. (1990). Microbiology (English translation of Mikrobiologiia) 59, 741-748] had approximately 88.0 % DNA-DNA relatedness with strain JW/IW010(T) and was included in the novel taxon.
TI  - A novel goose-type lysozyme gene with chitinolytic activity from the moderately thermophilic bacterium Ralstonia sp. A-471: cloning, sequencing, and expression.
AB  - In this study, we cloned the gene encoding goose-type (G-type) lysozyme with chitinase (Ra-ChiC) activity from Ralstonia sp. A-471 genomic DNA library. This is the first report of another type of chitinase after the previously reported chitinases ChiA (Ra-ChiA) and ChiB (Ra-ChiB) in the chitinase system of the moderately thermophilic bacterium, Ralstonia sp. A-471 and also the first such data in Ralstonia sp. G-type lysozyme gene. It consisted of 753 bp nucleotides, which encodes 251 amino acids including a putative signal peptide. This ORF was modular enzyme composed of a signal sequence, chitin-binding domain, linker, and catalytic domain. The catalytic domain of Ra-ChiC showed homologies to those of G-type lysozyme (glycoside hydrolases (GH) family 23, 16.8%) and lysozyme-like enzyme from Clostridium beijerincki (76.1%). Ra-ChiC had activities against ethylene glycol chitin, carboxyl methyl chitin, and soluble chitin but not against the cell wall of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. The enzyme produced alpha-anomer by hydrolyzing beta-1,4-glycosidic linkage of the substrate, indicating that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis through an inverting mechanism. When N-acetylglucosamine hexasaccharide [(GlcNAc)6] was hydrolyzed by the enzyme, the second and third glycosidic linkage from the non-reducing end were split producing (GlcNAc)2 + (GlcNAc)4 and (GlcNAc)3 + (GlcNAc)3 of almost the same concentration in the early stage of the reaction. The G-type lysozyme hydrolyzed (GlcNAc)6 in an endo-splitting manner, which produced (GlcNAc)3 + (GlcNAc)3 predominating over that to (GlcNAc)2 + (GlcNAc)4. Thus, Ra-ChiC was found to be a novel enzyme in its structural and functional properties.
TI  - Diversity of the resident microbiota in a thermophilic municipal biogas plant.
AB  - Biogas plants continuously convert biological wastes mainly into a mixture of methane, CO2 and H2O-a conversion that is carried out by a consortium of bacteria and archaea. Especially in the municipal plants dedicated towards waste treatment, the reactor feed may vary considerably, exposing the resident microbiota to a changing variety of substrates. To evaluate how and if such changes influence the microbiology, an established biogas plant (6,600 m3, up to 600 m3 biogas per h) was followed over the course of more than 2 years via polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes and subsequent sequencing. Both the bacterial and the archaeal community remained stable over the investigation. Of the bacterial consortium, about half of the sequences were in decreasing order of occurrence: Thermoacetogenium sp., Anaerobaculum mobile, Clostridium ultunense, Petrotoga sp., Lactobacillus hammesii, Butyrivibrio sp., Syntrophococcus sucromutans, Olsenella sp., Tepidanaerobacter sp., Sporanaerobacter acetigenes, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Lactobacillus fuchuensis or Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus parabrevis or Lactobacillus spicheri and Enterococcus faecalis. The other half matched closely to ones from similar habitats (thermophilic anaerobic methanogenic digestion). The archaea consisted of Methanobrevibacter sp., Methanoculleus bourgensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanimicrococcus blatticola and uncultured Methanomicrobiales. The role of these species in methane production is discussed.
TI  - Applicability of random cloning method to analyze microbial community in full-scale anaerobic digesters.
AB  - Microbial communities were analyzed in six full-scale anaerobic digesters and a lab-scale digester using the random cloning method. The purposes were to confirm the applicability, reproducibility, and error range of this method; to discuss the difference in the dominant microbes determined by this method in different operational conditions of temperature (mesophilic and thermophilic) and substrate (garbage, sewage sludge, and livestock waste); and to determine key microbes in each digester. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. In one of the samples, 373 clones were analyzed to study the composition of microbial community in the digester. Time course analysis was conducted from the start-up period for approximately one year in one of the digesters. Similar microbial diversity was obtained corresponding to the type of substrate change (sewage sludge to garbage). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) closely related to Coprothermobacter sp. and unidentified bacterium clones TUG14 and TUG22 disappeared during the first 40 d, while OTUs closely related to Bacillus sp. and Clostridium sp. increased later. Microbial diversity in digesters is strongly affected by the operational conditions, and similar microbial diversity can be obtained in triplicate analysis and under similar operational conditions. The present study verified the applicability of this method to discuss the overall difference in microbial communities.
TI  - Clostridium amylolyticum sp. nov., isolated from H2-producing UASB granules.
AB  - A Gram-stain-positive, strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, amylolytic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain SW408(T), was isolated from a laboratory-scale H(2)-producing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. The strain grew at 24-45 degrees C (no growth at or below 22 degrees C or at or above 47 degrees C), with optimum growth at 37 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 4.0-9.0 (no growth at or below pH 3.6 or at or above pH 9.3), with optimum growth at pH 7.0. Starch, cellobiose, glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, maltose, mannose, ribose and sucrose supported growth. The major end products from glucose fermentation were ethanol, acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Abundant H(2) was produced from starch fermentation. The DNA G+C content was 33.1 mol% (T(m) method). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the bacterium represents a previously unrecognized species within Clostridium rRNA cluster I and is most closely related to the type strain of Clostridium frigidicarnis (94.9% similarity). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain SW408(T) was identified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium amylolyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SW408(T) (=JCM 14823(T)=AS 1.5069(T)=CGMCC 1.5069(T)).
TI  - Evaluation of methods for preparing hydrogen-producing seed inocula under thermophilic condition by process performance and microbial community analysis.
AB  - Five methods for preparation of hydrogen-producing seeds (base, acid, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA), load-shock and heat shock treatments) as well as an untreated anaerobic digested sludge were compared for their hydrogen production performance and responsible microbial community structures under thermophilic condition (60 degrees C). The results showed that the load-shock treatment method was the best for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing seeds from mixed anaerobic cultures as it completely repressed methanogenic activity and gave the a maximum hydrogen production yield of 1.96 mol H(2) mol(-1) hexose with an hydrogen production rate of 11.2 mmol H(2) l(-1)h(-1). Load-shock and heat-shock treatments resulted in a dominance of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum with acetic acid and butyric acid type of fermentation while base- and acid-treated seeds were dominated by Clostridium sp. and BESA-treated seeds were dominated by Bacillus sp. The comparative experimental results from hydrogen production performance and microbial community analysis showed that the load-shock treatment method was better than the other four methods for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing seeds from anaerobic digested sludge. Load-shock treated sludge was implemented in palm oil mill effluent (POME) fermentation and was found to give maximum hydrogen production rates of 13.34 mmol H(2) l(-1)h(-1) and resulted in a dominance of Thermoanaerobacterium spp. Load-shock treatment is an easy and practical method for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria from anaerobic digested sludge.
TI  - The selenoproteome of Clostridium sp. OhILAs: characterization of anaerobic bacterial selenoprotein methionine sulfoxide reductase A.
AB  - Selenocysteine (Sec) is incorporated into proteins in response to UGA codons. This residue is frequently found at the catalytic sites of oxidoreductases. In this study, we characterized the selenoproteome of an anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium sp. (also known as Alkaliphilus oremlandii) OhILA, and identified 13 selenoprotein genes, five of which have not been previously described. One of the detected selenoproteins was methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA), an antioxidant enzyme that repairs oxidatively damaged methionines in a stereospecific manner. To date, little is known about MsrA from anaerobes. We characterized this selenoprotein MsrA which had a single Sec residue at the catalytic site but no cysteine (Cys) residues in the protein sequence. Its SECIS (Sec insertion sequence) element did not resemble those in Escherichia coli. Although with low translational efficiency, the expression of the Clostridium selenoprotein msrA gene in E. coli could be demonstrated by (75)Se metabolic labeling, immunoblot analyses, and enzyme assays, indicating that its SECIS element was recognized by the E. coli Sec insertion machinery. We found that the Sec-containing MsrA exhibited at least a 20-fold higher activity than its Cys mutant form, indicating a critical role of Sec in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, our data revealed that the Clostridium MsrA was inefficiently reducible by thioredoxin, which is a typical reducing agent for MsrA, suggesting the use of alternative electron donors in this anaerobic bacterium that directly act on the selenenic acid intermediate and do not require resolving Cys residues.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of a mitochondrial-like organelle from Blastocystis  sp. subtype 7.
AB  - A mitochondrion-like organelle (MLO) was isolated from isotonic homogenates of Blastocystis. The organelle sedimented at 5000 g for 10 min, and had an isopycnic density in sucrose of 1.2 g ml(-1). Biochemical characterization enabled the demonstration of several key enzymes that allowed the construction of a metabolic pathway consisting of an incomplete Krebs cycle linked to the oxygen-sensitive enzymes pyruvate : NADP(+) oxidoreductase (PNO), acetate : succinate CoA transferase (ASCT) and succinate thiokinase (STK), which cumulatively are responsible for recycling CoA and generating ATP. The organelle differs from typical aerobic mitochondria in possessing an oxygen-sensitive PNO that can use FAD(+) or FMN(+) as electron acceptor but is inactive with NAD(+), Spinacia oleracea ferredoxin or Clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin. A gene with 77 % sequence similarity to the PNO mitochondrion precursor cluster from Euglena gracilis sp[Q941N5] was identified in the Blastocystis genome database. A second cluster with 56 % sequence similarity to the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) from Trichomonas vaginalis was also identified, which is in agreement with the concept that the PNO gene arose through the fusion of a eubacterial gene for PFOR with the gene for NADPH : cytochrome p450 reductase. Hydrogenase activity was not detected under the conditions used in this study. The Blastocystis oranelle therefore demonstrates significant biochemical differences from traditional mitochondria and hydrogenosomes, but possesses features of both. Based upon the results of this study, the Blastocystis organelle falls into the category of a MLO.
TI  - An anaerobic bacterial MsrB model reveals catalytic mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages provided by selenocysteine and cysteine in reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide.
AB  - We verified and generalized the catalytic features that selenocysteine (Sec) and  cysteine (Cys) contribute to the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide using an anaerobic bacterial MsrB from Clostridium sp. OhILA as a model protein. The Sec-containing Clostridium MsrB form exhibited 100-fold higher activity than its Cys-containing form, revealing that Sec provided the catalytic advantage of higher activity. However, a resolving Cys was required for the thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent recycling process of the Sec-containing form. Thus, Trx could reduce the selenenylsulfide bond, but its Trx-dependent recycling process was much less efficient compared to that for the disulfide bond in the Cys-containing form, demonstrating an obvious catalytic disadvantage. These data agreed well with our previous data on mammalian MsrBs, and therefore suggested that the catalytic mechanisms, as well as the catalytic advantages and disadvantages provided by the Sec and Cys residues, are most likely conserved from anaerobic bacteria to mammals. Taken together, we propose that the use of Sec in MsrB may depend on a balance between the catalytic advantage of higher activity and the disadvantage of a less efficient regeneration process provided by this residue.
TI  - Resolution of culture Clostridium bifermentans DPH-1 into two populations, a Clostridium sp. and tetrachloroethene-dechlorinating Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain JH1.
AB  - Clostridium bifermentans strain DPH-1 reportedly dechlorinates tetrachloroethene  (PCE) to cis-1,2-dichloroethene. Cultivation-based approaches resolved the DPH-1 culture into two populations: a nondechlorinating Clostridium sp. and PCE-dechlorinating Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain JH1. Strain JH1 carries pceA, encoding a PCE reductive dehalogenase, and shares other characteristics with Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51.
TI  - Reclassification of Clostridium coccoides, Ruminococcus hansenii, Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, Ruminococcus luti, Ruminococcus productus and Ruminococcus schinkii as Blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., Blautia hansenii comb. nov., Blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., Blautia luti comb. nov., Blautia producta comb. nov., Blautia schinkii comb. nov. and description of Blautia wexlerae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on 15 isolates of an unidentified Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-sporulating coccobacillus-shaped bacterium isolated from human faeces. The novel organisms were catalase-negative, indole-negative and produced acetate and succinate as end products of metabolism. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the 15 isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown subline within the clostridial rRNA cluster XIVa. The novel isolates formed a robust phylogenetic group with a number of organisms which included Clostridium coccoides, Ruminococcus luti, Ruminococcus obeum and a number of other misclassified ruminococci. On the basis of these studies, a novel genus, Blautia gen. nov., is proposed. It is suggested that Clostridium coccoides, Ruminococcus hansenii, Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, Ruminococcus luti, Ruminococcus productus, and Ruminococcus schinkii are transferred to this genus as Blautia coccoides gen. nov., comb. nov., Blautia hansenii comb. nov., Blautia hydrogenotrophica comb. nov., Blautia luti comb. nov., Blautia producta comb. nov. and Blautia schinkii comb. nov. One of the new isolates, the hitherto unknown coccus-shaped bacterial strain WAL 14507T (=ATCC BAA-1564T=DSM 19850T) is proposed as representing the type strain of a novel species, Blautia wexlerae sp. nov.
TI  - Chitinolytic activities of Clostridium sp. JM2 isolated from stool of human administered per orally by chitosan.
AB  - The novel chitinolytic bacterium Clostridium beijerinckii strain JM2 was isolated from the stool of healthy volunteers supplied daily per orally with 3 g of chitosan. The bacterium grown on colloidal chitin produced a complete array of chitinolytic enzymes. Significant activities of endochitinase, exochitinase and chitosanase were excreted into the medium (301, 282 and 268 nkat/microg protein, respectively). The high cellular activity of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGase) and chitosanase were detected (732.4 and 154 nkat/microg protein, respectively). NAGase activity represented the main activity associated with the cellular fraction. The activities of both enzymes tested increased from 20 to 50 degrees C; the optimum reaction temperature estimated being 50 degrees C. Endochitinase as well as NAGase showed an activity in the pH interval of 4.0-8.0; the optimum pH values were 6.5 and 6.0, respectively. The extracellular endochitinase complex consisted of six isoenzymes with molar mass of 32-76 kDa; in the cellular fraction five bands with molar mass of 45-86 kDa were detected. Exochitinase activity was demonstrated in the form of three bands (with molar mass of 30-57 kDa), NAGase activity displayed one band of 45 kDa.
TI  - [Microbial diversity analysis in rotating drum biofilter for nitric oxide denitrifying removal].
AB  - PCR-DGGE was applied to analyze the microbial communities in rotating drum biofilter (RDB) for nitric oxide denitrifying removal under anaerobic conditions. The 16S rRNA genes (V3 region) were amplified with two universal primers (338F-GC and 518R). These amplified DNA fragments were separated by parallel DGGE. The DGGE profiles of biofilm samples from different sections of RDB are similar and about sixteen types of microorganisms are identified in the biofilm samples. These results show that microbial diversity of RDB firstly increases but then decreases with the addition of Cu II (EDTA) and the increase of NO removal efficiency. However, the change of microbial community is not significant during the process. Eight major bands of 16S rRNA genes fragments from DGGE profiles of biofilm samples were further eluted from gel, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced. The sequences of these fragments were compared with the database in GeneBank (NCBI). The gene analysis of 16S rRNA showed that the major populations are Cytopahga-Flexibacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) group Bacteroides, beta -Proteobacterium, gamma-Proteobacterium and Clostridium sp.. In addition, denitrification is related with band G-5, G-6 and G-8. G-5 is affiliated with gamma-Proteobacterium. Both G-6 and G-8 are affiliated with beta-Proteobacterium.
TI  - Novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  - In an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-GalNAcases), four potential genes were cloned. Three of the expressed proteins EngEF from Enterococcus faecalis, EngPA from Propionibacterium acnes, and EngCP from Clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. Their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-GalNAcases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (EngSP) and Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL). All enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. The Core 1 disaccharide Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. EngEF exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. EngEF and EngPA were also able to fully hydrolyze the Core 3 disaccharide GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP. This is the first report of endo-alpha-GalNAcases EngEF and EngPA acting on Core 3 in addition to Core 1 O-glycans. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP or GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-GalNAcases tested in this work.
TI  - Listeria monocytogenes septicaemia and concurrent clostridial infection in an adult alpaca (Lama pacos).
AB  - A 10-year-old alpaca with a history of anorexia, weight loss and diarrhoea was humanely destroyed and shown to have a multifocal necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis and colitis, as well as an ulcerative to diphtheroid ileitis. Immunohistochemical examination revealed Listeria monocytogenes antigen in the liver and ileum. In addition, L. monocytogenes and Listeria sp.-specific gene fragments were detected by the polymerase chain reaction. L. monocytogenes was isolated from liver and small intestine and Clostridium perfringens type A with beta(2) toxin was found in the small intestine. It is suggested that the infection with C. perfringens type A facilitated the systemic spread of L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Ruminococcus gauvreauii sp. nov., a glycopeptide-resistant species isolated from  a human faecal specimen.
AB  - A novel strictly anaerobic, vancomycin-resistant, Gram-positive coccus (strain CCRI-16,110(T)) was isolated from a human faecal specimen. This strain was characterized using morphological, biochemical and molecular taxonomic methods. The organism was unable to hydrolyse aesculin and failed to produce acid from cellobiose, d-lactose and alpha-raffinose. Acetic acid was the sole product of glucose fermentation by the organism. On the basis of 16S rRNA and tuf gene sequence comparison, strain CCRI-16,110(T) was most closely related to species of the genus Ruminococcus and formed a hitherto unknown sublineage within the Clostridium coccoides rRNA cluster of organisms (cluster XIVa). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, a novel species, Ruminococcus gauvreauii sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is CCRI-16,110(T) (=NML 060141(T) =CCUG 54,292(T) =JCM 14987(T)).
TI  - Reduction of uranium(VI) to uranium(IV) by clostridia.
AB  - Several different species of clostridia reduced U(VI) to U(IV) to various degrees. The optimal pH for U(VI) reduction is 5 to 6 in most cases; a Clostridium sp. showed the highest rate at pH 4. Nitrate did not affect U(VI) reduction, indicating that this process in clostridia is nitrate independent.
TI  - Reductive dissolution of Pu(IV) by Clostridium sp. under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - An anaerobic, gram positive, spore-forming bacterium Clostridium sp., common in soils and wastes, capable of reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), Mn(IV) to Mn(II), Tc(VII) to Tc(IV), and U(VI) to U(IV), reduced Pu(IV) to Pu(III). Addition of 242Pu (IV)-nitrate to the bacterial growth medium at pH 6.4 resulted in the precipitation of Pu as amorphous Pu(OH)4 due to hydrolysis and polymerization reactions. The Pu (1 x 10(-5) M) had no effect upon growth of the bacterium as evidenced by glucose consumption; carbon dioxide and hydrogen production; a decrease in pH of the medium from 6.4 to 3.0 due to production of acetic and butyric acids from glucose fermentation; and a change in the Eh of the culture medium from +50 to -180 mV. Commensurate with bacterial growth, Pu was rapidly solubilized as evidenced by an increase in Pu concentration in solution which passed through a 0.03 microm filtration. Selective solvent extraction of the culture by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) indicated the presence of a reduced Pu species in the soluble fraction. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopic (XANES) analysis of Pu in the culture sample at the Pu LIII absorption edge (18.054 keV) showed a shift of -3 eV compared to a Pu(IV) standard indicating reduction of Pu(IV) to Pu(III). These results suggestthat, although Pu generally exists as insoluble Pu(IV) in the environment, under appropriate conditions, anaerobic microbial activity could affect the long-term stability and mobility of Pu by its reductive dissolution.
TI  - Adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  - A wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. Hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have been described with several neonatal infections. We studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. The infections diagnosed included Neisseria meningitidies, group A streptococcus, Rickettsia rickettsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ehrlichia sp., Bacillus anthracis, Leptospira sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., Legionella sp., Yersinia pestis, and Treponema pallidum. Bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. Bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with N. meningitidis, four with R. rickettsii, four with S. pneumoniae, three with group A streptococcus, two with S. aureus, two with B. anthracis, one with T. pallidum, and one with Legionella sp. Bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). Hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. Bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. Although N. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.
TI  - Detection of active butyrate-degrading microorganisms in methanogenic sludges by  RNA-based stable isotope probing.
AB  - Butyrate-degrading bacteria in four methanogenic sludges were studied by RNA-based stable isotope probing. Bacterial populations in the (13)C-labeled rRNA fractions were distinct from unlabeled fractions, and Syntrophaceae species, Tepidanaerobacter sp., and Clostridium spp. dominated. These results suggest that diverse microbes were active in butyrate degradation under methanogenic conditions.
TI  - Lutispora thermophila gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium isolated from a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor digesting municipal solid wastes.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium (strain EBR46T) was isolated from an enrichment culture derived from an anaerobic thermophilic (55 degrees C) methanogenic bioreactor treating artificial solid wastes. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed strain EBR46T within a distinct lineage between Clostridium clusters II and III. The closest recognized relative of strain EBR46T was Gracilibacter thermotolerans DSM 17427T (85.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The DNA G+C content of strain EBR46T was 36.2 mol%. The novel strain grew optimally at 55-58 degrees C and at pH 7.5-8.0 and was able to grow on peptone, tryptone, Casamino acids, casein hydrolysate, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, cysteine, lysine and serine in the presence of 0.2 % yeast extract. Carbohydrates were not utilized. The main products from tryptone utilization were acetate, iso-butyrate, propionate and iso-valerate. Strain EBR46T produced hydrogen sulfide from cysteine. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, C14 : 0, C16 : 0 DMA (dimethyl acetal) and iso-C15 : 0 DMA. Based on its unique phylogenetic and physiological features, strain EBR46T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Lutispora thermophila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is EBR46T (=NBRC 102133T=DSM 19022T).
TI  - Clostridium tepidiprofundi sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic bacterium from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.
AB  - A moderately thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium (strain SG 508T) was isolated from a hydrothermal vent chimney located at 1 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise at a depth of 2650 m. Cells of strain SG 508T were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4-0.6 microm in diameter and 2.0-3.0 microm in length. Spore formation was observed only below pH 5.5. The temperature range for growth was 22-60 degrees C, with optimum growth at 50 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 4.0-8.5, with optimum growth at pH 6.0-6.8. Growth of strain SG 508T was observed at NaCl concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 6.0 % (w/v), with optimum growth at 2.5 % (w/v). Substrates utilized by strain SG 508T included casein, peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, beef extract, starch, maltose and glucose. The products of glucose fermentation were ethanol, acetate, H2, formate and CO2. Strain SG 508T was able to reduce elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. The DNA G+C content of strain SG 508T was 30.9 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolated organism belonged to cluster I of the genus Clostridium. On the basis of its physiological properties and data from phylogenetic analyses, strain SG 508T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium tepidiprofundi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SG 508T (=DSM 19306T =VKM B-2459T).
TI  - Transformation of inorganic and organic arsenic by Alkaliphilus oremlandii sp. nov. strain OhILAs.
AB  - Alkaliphilus oremlandii sp. nov. strain OhILAs is a mesophilic, spore-forming, motile, low mole%GC gram positive. It was enriched from Ohio River sediments on a basal medium with 20 mM lactate and 5 mM arsenate and isolated through passage on medium with increased arsenic concentration (10 and 20 mM), tindalization, and serial dilution. The pH optimal for growth was 8.4 and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated it is most closely related to species in the genus Alkaliphilus (A. crotonoxidans 95%, A. auruminator 95%, A. metalliredigens, 94%). A strict anaerobe, it can ferment lactate via the acrylate pathway as well as fructose and glycerol. A. oremlandii also has respiratory capability, as it is able to use arsenate and thiosulfate as terminal electron acceptors with acetate, pyruvate, formate, lactate, fumarate, glycerol, or fructose as the electron donor. A respiratory arsenate reductase, which is constitutively expressed, has been identified through biochemical and Western blot analyses and confirmed by cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the structural subunit arrA. The entire arr operon as well as the ars operon have also been identified in the fully annotated genome. A. oremlandii also transforms the organoarsenical 3-nitro-4-hydroxy benzene arsonic acid (roxarsone). Growth experiments and genomic analysis suggest that it couples the reduction of the nitro group of the organoarsenical to the oxidation of either lactate or fructose in a dissimilatory manner, generating ATP via a sodium dependent ATP synthase.
TI  - Prognostic factors and impact of antibiotherapy in 117 cases of anaerobic bacteraemia.
AB  - Bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria occurs infrequently, making the systematic  use of an anaerobic blood sample bottle in patients with sepsis controversial. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and microbiological data from all cases of anaerobic bacteraemia in a teaching hospital over 2 years and determined the prognostic factors and antibiotic management. With the goal of evaluating the morbidity and mortality of bacteraemia due to anaerobic bacteria, a case-control study was also performed. One hundred eighty-four blood cultures from 125 patients grew at least one anaerobic bacterium, representing 0.5% of all and 7.0% of the positive blood cultures. One hundred seventeen patients were studied. In 24 cases, anaerobic blood cultures were associated with concomitant aerobic bacteria isolation. The most frequently isolated anaerobic species were Bacteroides sp. (n = 62), Clostridium sp. (n = 25), and Fusobacterium sp. (n = 12). The most frequent site of origin was the digestive tract (n = 61). In 51 cases, patients did not receive adequate empirical antianaerobic therapy. The mortality rate was 27%. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.059; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.021-1.100], cancer history (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.126-9.156), and ineffective definitive antibiotherapy (OR 19.292, 95% CI 5.330-69.832) were independently associated with increased hospital mortality. The 72 patients that could be matched with patients without anaerobic bacteria according to their primary diagnosis had a longer hospitalisation and a trend toward increased mortality (P = 0.08). Anaerobic bacteraemia contributed significantly to the morbidity of the patients, and adequate empirical antibiotherapy may play an important role in the clinical outcomes.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization of some transition metal(II) complexes of acetone p-amino acetophenone salicyloyl hydrazone and their anti microbial activity.
AB  - Complexes of the type [M(apash)Cl] and [M(Hapash)(H2O)SO4], where M = Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II); Hapash = acetone p-amino acetophenone salicyloyl hydrazone have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductance, magnetic moments, electronic, ESR and IR spectra, thermal studies (TGA & DTA) and X-ray diffraction studies. The ligand coordinates through two >C=N and a deprotonated enolate group in all the chloro complexes, whereas through two >C=N- and a >C=O group in all the sulfato complexes. The electronic spectra suggest a square planar geometry for Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) chloride complexes and an octahedral geometry for the sulfate complexes. ESR data show an isotropic symmetry for [Cu(apash)Cl] and [Cu(Hapash)(H2O)SO4] in solid state. However, ESR spectra of both Cu(II) complexes indicate the presence of unpaired electron in d x2-y2. The X-ray diffraction parameters for [Co(apash)Cl] and [Cu(Hapash)(H2O)SO4] complexes correspond to a tetragonal and an orthorhombic crystal lattices, respectively. Thermal studies of [Co(apash)Cl] complex shows a multi-step decomposition pattern. Most of the complexes show better antifungal activity than the standard miconazole against a number of pathogenic fungi. The antibacterial activity of these complexes has been evaluated against E. coli and Clostridium sp. which shows a moderate activity.
TI  - Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from olive mill wastewater.
AB  - A moderately halophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, designated 37HS60(T), was  isolated from an olive mill wastewater in southern Morocco (Marrakesh). The cells were straight, motile and stained Gram-positive, forming spherical and terminal spores and with an atypical thick and stratified multilayered cell wall. Major fatty acid components were iso-C17:1omega10c or anteiso-C17:1omega3c (19.3%), C14:0 (14.3%), C16:1omega7c (9.9%), C16:1omega7c DMA (8.5%) and C16:0 (7.6%). Strain 37HS60(T) grew from 20 to 50 degrees C with an optimum at 40-45 degrees C, and growth was observed from pH 5.5 to 8.5 with an optimum of 6.8. The salinity range for growth was 10-100 g NaCl l(-1) with an optimum at 50 g NaCl l(-1). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 37HS60(T) fell within the evolutionary radiation enclosed by cluster XII of the Clostridium subphylum. Strain 37HS60(T) exhibited highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 92.0% with Caloranaerobacter azorensis and 90.6% with Clostridium purinilyticum. Moreover, 37HS60(T) did not grow on basal medium with hexose or pentose sugars as carbon and energy sources. Pyruvate, fumarate and succinate were the best substrates for 37HS60(T) growth with 1.0 g yeast extract l(-1). The DNA G+C content was 33.0 mol%. Due to its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, isolate 37HS60(T) is proposed as a novel species of a new genus, Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is 37HS60(T) (=JCM 14354(T)=CCUG 53849(T)).
TI  - Proteiniborus ethanoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic protein-utilizing bacterium.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, mesophilic, protein-utilizing bacterial strain, GW(T), was isolated from the mesophilic hydrogen-producing granular sludge used to treat food industry wastewater. The strain was a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming and non-motile rod. Growth of the strain was observed at 20-48 degrees C and at pH 6.4-10.0. The strain used yeast extract and peptone as carbon and energy sources. Weak growth was also observed with tryptone and Casamino acids as carbon and energy sources. The strain used none of the tested carbohydrates, alcohols or fatty acids. The fermentation products in peptone-yeast broth included ethanol, acetic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Gelatin was not hydrolysed. Nitrate was reduced. Indole was produced. NH(3) and H(2)S were not produced. The DNA G+C content of strain GW(T) was 38.0 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids were the saturated fatty acids C(14:0) (15.58%), C(16:0) (25.40%) and C(18:0) (12.03%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity revealed that strain GW(T) represented a new branch within cluster XII of the Clostridium subphylum, with <89.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to all described species. On the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, strain GW(T) represents a new genus and novel species, for which the name Proteiniborus ethanoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GW(T) (=CGMCC 1.5055(T)=JCM 14574(T)).
TI  - High-level secretion of a chimeric thermostable lichenase from Bacillus subtilis  by screening of site-mutated signal peptides with structural alterations.
AB  - A chimeric gene mHG (669 bp) was constructed by substitution of Clostridium thermocellum ZJL4 lichenase (CG) N-terminal fragment (except its signal sequence) for the counterpart of Bacillus sp. A3 lichenase (BG). To acquire high-level secretion of the chimeric lichenase (mHG) in Bacillus subtilis, a series of site-mutated signal peptides were designed. The activity of mHG, which was directed by an artificial hydrophobic signal peptide H1 (MMARKIAGMATSLLVIFSSSAVA) from cytoplasm into growth medium, reached 80.56 U/ml after 22-h incubation, indicating that signal peptide hydrophobicity appears to be critical for early stages in mHG export. By purification of the mHG (approximately 25.3 kDa) from cultures of B. subtilis (pBSG-H1), enzymatic property assays showed that the common optima for mHG were 70 degrees C and pH 5.0. The residual activity of mHG at 90 degrees C for 10 min was 83.45% of its maximum activity, which was almost similar to that of CG (90 degrees C, 10 min, 84.33%). This constructed shuttle expression vector with a novel signal peptide exhibited its applicability for high-level production of heterologous proteins from B. subtilis. Moreover, the high-level secreted mHG with relatively high thermostability could be a potential candidate for feed industrial applications.
TI  - Howardella ureilytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium from a sheep rumen.
AB  - An unidentified obligately anaerobic, fastidious, Gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, non-fermentative coccoid-shaped bacterium (designated strain GPC 589(T)) was isolated from the rumen fluid of a sheep. The major fatty acid constituents (>5 %) were C(16 : 0) (29.2 %), C(18 : 0) (40.7 %) and an unidentified compound (19.7 %) with an equivalent chain-length of 13.523. The G+C content of the DNA was 34 mol%. The organism was strongly ureolytic and generated ATP through the hydrolysis of urea. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that strain GPC 589(T) was far removed, phylogenetically, from the ruminococci and related Gram-positive anaerobic cocci but exhibited a phylogenetic association with Clostridium rRNA cluster XIVa [as defined by Collins, M. D., Lawson, P. A., Willems, A., Cordoba, J. J., Fernandez-Garayzabal, J., Garcia, P., Cai, J., Hippe, H. & Farrow, J. A. E. (1994). Int J Syst Bacteriol 44, 812-826]. Sequence divergence values of 12.5 % or more were observed between strain GPC 589(T) and all other recognized species within this and related rRNA clostridial clusters. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain GPC 589(T) represents a new genus within cluster XIVa. On the basis of both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that strain GPC 589(T) should be classified as representing a new genus and novel species, Howardella ureilytica gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is strain GPC 589(T) (=DSM 15118(T)=JCM 13267(T)).
TI  - A possible role for Clostridium difficile in the etiology of calf enteritis.
AB  - Clostridium difficile was investigated as a possible cause of enteritis in calves. The organism and its toxins (TcdA and TcdB), respectively, were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves. Culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive. However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found throughout the colon. Purified toxins A and B (individually and conjointly) caused comparable lesions, as well as fluid accumulation, in ligated intestinal loops. Our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others [Rodriguez-Palacios, A., Stampfli, H.R., Duffield, T., Peregrine, A.S., Trotz-Williams, L.A., Arroyo, L.G., Brazier, J.S., Weese, J.S., 2006. Clostridium difficile PCR ribotypes in calves, Canada. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 12, 1730-1736; Porter, M.C., Reggiardo, C., Bueschel, D.M., Keel, M.K., Songer, J.G., 2002. Association of Clostridium difficile with bovine neonatal diarrhea. Proc. 45th Ann. Mtg. Amer. Assoc. Vet. Lab. Diagn., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.] and add strength to a working hypothesis that C. difficile infection and the accompanying intoxication can manifest as diarrhea in calves. It seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R52 in the human digestive tract and their effects on the microbiota homeostasis. We designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. A 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)L. rhamnosus R11 and 1 x 10(8)L. acidophilus R52, and a 12-day wash-out period. The 2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of L. rhamnosus R11 were detected in faecal samples from all volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) equivalents/g of stool. L. acidophilus R52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool. Dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and generally lower levels. No significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. Mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the Clostridium coccoides, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively.
TI  - UV disinfection of RBC-treated light greywater effluent: kinetics, survival and regrowth of selected microorganisms.
AB  - The microbial quality of raw greywater was found to be much better than that of municipal wastewater, with 1.6 x 10(7)cfu ml(-1) heterotrophic plate count (HPC), and 3.8 x 10(4), 9.9 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(3) and 4.6 x 10(0)cfu 100 ml(-1) faecal coliforms (FC), Staphylococcus aureus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. and Clostridium perfringes sp., respectively. Further, three viral indicators monitored (somatic phage, host: Escherichia coli CN(13) and F-RNA phages, hosts: E. coli F+(amp), E. coli K12) were not present in raw greywater. The greywater was treated by an RBC followed by sedimentation. The treatment removed two orders of magnitude of all bacteria. UV disinfection kinetics, survival and regrowth of HPC, FC, P. aeruginosa sp. and S. aureus sp. were examined. At doses up to 69 mW s cm(-2) FC were found to be the most resistant bacteria, followed by HPC, P. aeruginosa sp. and S. aureus sp. (inactivation rate coefficients: 0.0687, 0.113, 0.129 and 0.201 cm2 mW(-1)s(-1), respectively). At higher doses (69-439 mW s cm(-2)) all but HPC (which exhibited a tailing curve) were completely eliminated. Microscopic examination showed that FC self-aggregate in the greywater effluent. This provides FC an advantage at low doses, since the concentration of suspended matter (that can provide shelter from UV radiation) in the effluent was very low. FC, P. aeruginosa sp. and S. aureus sp. did not exhibit regrowth up to 6h after exposure to increasing UV doses (19-439 mW s cm(-2)). HPC regrowth was proven to be statistically significant in un-disinfected effluent and after irradiation with high UV doses (147 and 439 mW s cm(-2)). At these doses regrowth resulted from growth of UV-resistant bacteria due to decreased competition with other bacteria eliminated by the irradiation.
TI  - The isolation and microbial community analysis of hydrogen producing bacteria from activated sludge.
AB  - AIMS: To profile the fractions of bacteria in heat-treated activated sludge capable of producing hydrogen and subsequently to isolate those organisms and confirm their ability to produce hydrogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: Profiling the community composition of the microflora in activated sludge using 16S rRNA gene-directed polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis suggested that a majority of bacteria were various Clostridium species. This was confirmed by clone library analysis, where 80% of the cloned inserts were Clostridium sp. A total of five isolates were established on solid media. Three of them, designated as W1, W4 and W5, harboured the hydrogenase gene as determined by PCR and DNA sequence analysis (99% similarity). These isolates were similar to Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium diolis as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence. A maximum hydrogen production yield of 220 ml H(2) g(-1) glucose was achieved by W5, which was grown on improved mineral medium by batch fermentation without pH adjustment and nitrogen sparging during fermentation. Accumulation of malic acid and fumaric acid during hydrogen fermentation might lead to higher hydrogen yields for W4 and W5. W1 is the first reported Clostridium species that can tolerate microaerobic conditions for producing hydrogen. CONCLUSION: Clostridium species in heat-treated activated sludge were the most commonly identified bacteria responsible for hydrogen production. Specific genetic markers for strains W1, W4 and W5 would be of great utility in investigating hydrogen production at the molecular level. Two previously described primer sets targeting hydrogenase genes were shown not to be specific, amplifying other genes from nonhydrogen producers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Clostridium species isolated from heat-treated activated sludge were confirmed as hydrogen producers during dark hydrogen fermentation. The isolates will be useful for studying hydrogen production from wastewater, including the process of gene regulation and hydrogenase activity.
TI  - Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus sp. nov., a thermophilic heterotrophic anaerobe from Yellowstone National Park.
AB  - Strain 39E(T), originally characterized as Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum strain 39E and later renamed as Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus strain 39E, shows less than 97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strain of the type species of the genus Thermoanaerobacter, T. ethanolicus strain JW 200(T). On the basis of a polyphasic analysis that included DNA-DNA hybridization studies with the subspecies of Thermoanaerobacter brockii, its closest phylogenetic relatives, strain 39E(T) represents a novel species of the genus Thermoanaerobacter, for which the name Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 39E(T) (=DSM 2355(T)=ATCC 33223(T)).
TI  - Prevalence of diphtheria and tetanus antibodies and circulation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - The introduction of routine vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria in Brazil  has decreased the incidence and changed the epidemiology of both diseases. We then investigated the prevalence of Corynebacterium diphtheriae carrier status and diphtheria and tetanus immunity in Sao Paulo, Brazil. From November 2001 to March 2003, 374 individuals were tested for the presence of C. diphtheriae in the naso-oropharynx and of serum diphtheria and tetanus antibodies. Participants were all healthy individuals without acute or chronic pathologies and they were stratified by age as follows: 0-12 months and 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-24, 25-39, 40-59, and > or =60 years. Antibodies were assessed using a double-antigen ELISA. C. diphtheriae species were identified by biochemical analysis and toxigenicity was assessed by the Elek test. For diphtheria, full protection (antibodies > or =0.1 IU/mL) was present in 84% of the individuals, 15% had basic protection (antibodies > or =0.01 and <0.1 IU/mL) and 1% were susceptible (antibodies <0.01 IU/mL). Full tetanus protection (antibodies > or =0.1 IU/mL) was present in 79% of the participants, 18% had basic protection (antibodies > or =0.01 and <0.1 IU/mL) and 3% were susceptible (antibodies <0.01 IU/mL). The geometric mean of diphtheria and tetanus antibodies reached the highest values at 5-9 years and decreased until the 40-59-year age range, increasing again in individuals over 60 years. Three participants (0.8%) were carriers of C. diphtheriae, all non-toxigenic strains. The present results demonstrate the clear need of periodic booster for tetanus and diphtheria vaccine in adolescents and adults after primary immunization in childhood.
TI  - Molecular phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and its spatial distribution in composts.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate microbial diversity of swine manure composts in the initial  stage and the spatial distribution due to gradient effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples in different locations of a composting pile were taken and analysed by using a culture-independent approach. Total community DNA was extracted and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, restriction fragment length polymorphism-screened and sequenced. Thirty-three unique sequence types were found among the 110 analysed positive clones from superstratum sample; 56 among 122 from middle-level sample and 32 among 114 from substrate sample, respectively. The sequences related to Clostridium sp. were most common in the composts. One hundred and thirteen out of 121 16S rDNA sequence types displayed homology with those in the GenBank database. Seven 16S rDNA sequence types were not closely related to any known species. The middle-level sample had the highest microbial diversity, containing unique sequences related to Lactosphaera pasteurii, Firmicutes sp., Aerococcus sp., Megasphaera sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp. CONCLUSIONS: Pile temperature significantly affected microbial community in the initial stage of the composting. Microbial community in different locations is quite different resulting from gradient effect. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results of this study reveal high bacterial diversity in manure composts, and provide molecular evidence to support gradient effect on microbial diversity in initial stage as well.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics and product distribution during pH-adjusted fermentation of vegetable wastes.
AB  - AIMS: To estimate the effect of pH on the structures of bacterial community during fermentation of vegetable wastes and to investigate the relationship between bacterial community dynamics and product distribution. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacterial communities in five batch tests controlled at different pH values [uncontrolled (about pH 4), 5, 6, 7 and 8] were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). The two fingerprinting methods provided consistent results and principal component analysis indicated a close similarity of bacterial community at pH 7 and 8 in addition to those at pH 4-6. This clustering also corresponded to dominant metabolic pathway. Thus, pH 7-8 shifted from alcohol-forming to acid-forming, especially butyric acid, whereas both alcohol-forming and acid-forming dominated at pH 5-6, and at pH 4, fermentation was inhibited. Shannon-weaver index was calculated to analyse the DGGE profiles, which revealed that the bacterial diversities at pH 7 and 8 were the highest while those at pH 5 and 4 (uncontrolled) were the lowest. According to sequencing results of the bands excised from DGGE gels, lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium sp. were predominant at all pH values, but varieties in species were observed as pH changed and time prolonged. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial community during fermentation was materially influenced by pH and the diverse product distribution was related to the shift of different bacterial population. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study reveals that the impact of pH on fermentation product distribution is implemented primarily by changes of bacterial community. It also provides information about the comparison of two fingerprinting methods, DGGE and SSCP.
TI  - Dark H2 fermentation from sucrose and xylose using H2-producing indigenous bacteria: feasibility and kinetic studies.
AB  - Cellulosic materials are the major components in biomass feedstock used for bioenergy production. Hydrolytic products of cellulosic substances consist primarily of hexose (e.g., glucose) and pentose (e.g., xylose). In this study, the efficiency of fermentative conversion of sucrose (representing hexose) and xylose into H2 was examined with seven H2-producing pure strains isolated from a high-rate H2-producing system in our recent work. The isolates were identified as Clostridium butyricum (strains CGS2 and CGS5), Clostridium pasteurianum (strains CH1, CH4, CH5, and CH7), and Klebsiella sp. Batch H2 fermentation shows that only Cl. butyricum and Klebsiella sp. strains could utilize xylose for H2 production, while all of them can grow and produce H2 on sucrose. Among all strains examined, Cl. butyricum CGS5 was the best H2 producer on xylose with the highest H2 production rate and yield of 212.5 ml/h/l and 0.73 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively, taking place at 20 g COD/l of xylose. In contrast, Cl. pasteurianum CH4 was most efficient in converting sucrose to H2; the highest H2 production rate (569 ml/h/l) and yield (2.07 mol H2/mol hexose) were obtained at a sucrose concentration of 40 g COD/l. The substrate preference of the H2-producing isolates was consistent with the bacterial community structure that existed in the bioreactor, showing that Cl. butyricum and Cl. pasteurianum were predominant in the cultures grown on xylose and sucrose, respectively. Irrespective of the carbon substrate used, butyrate and acetate were the predominant soluble metabolites. Shake-flask cultures displayed higher H2 productivity over static ones, indicating the importance of efficient mass transfer for H2 production. The dependence of cell growth and H2 production on carbon substrate concentration could be described by the proposed kinetic models with good agreements.
TI  - Tetanus-induced acute kidney injury in a renal transplant recipient.
AB  - A 48-year-old renal transplant recipient who developed tetanus 6 years after transplantation is described. His immunosuppressive protocol was mofetil mycophenolate, sirolimus, and prednisone. The patient presented symptoms of severe tetanus with autonomic dysfunction, requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation. His clinical course was marked by development of tetanus-induced acute kidney injury and sepsis. He was discharged after 37 days of hospitalization with recovered renal function. Tetanus is a preventable disease associated with a high fatality rate. Its treatment is difficult and requires specialized and intensive care. This case highlights the crucial importance of following adequate immunization guidelines in transplant recipients.
TI  - Aminiphilus circumscriptus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic amino-acid-degrading bacterium from an upflow anaerobic sludge reactor.
AB  - Strain ILE-2(T) was isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor treating brewery wastewater. The motile, non-sporulating, slightly curved cells (2-4 x 0.1 microm) stained Gram-negative and grew optimally at 42 degrees C and pH 7.1 with 0.5 % NaCl. The strain required yeast extract for growth and fermented Casamino acids, peptone, isoleucine, arginine, lysine, alanine, valine, glutamate, histidine, glutamine, methionine, malate, fumarate, glycerol and pyruvate to acetate, propionate and minor amounts of branched-chain fatty acids. Carbohydrates, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isovalerate, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, butanol, lactate, succinate, starch, casein, gelatin, xylan and a number of other amino acids were not utilized. The DNA G+C content of strain ILE-2(T) was 52.7 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that ILE-2(T) was distantly related to members of the genera Aminobacterium (83 % similarity) and Aminomonas (85 % similarity) in the family Syntrophomonadaceae, order Clostridiales, phylum Firmicutes. On the basis of the results of our polyphasic analysis, strain ILE-2(T) represents a novel species and genus within the family Syntrophomonadaceae, for which the name Aminiphilus circumscriptus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Aminiphilus circumscriptus is ILE-2(T) (=DSM 16581(T) =JCM 14039(T)).
TI  - Clostridium nitrophenolicum sp. nov., a novel anaerobic p-nitrophenol-degrading bacterium, isolated from a subsurface soil sample.
AB  - An obligate anaerobic, mesophilic, motile and endospore-forming bacterium, designated 1D(T), was isolated from a subsurface soil sample. The young culture of strain 1D(T) was Gram-positive and formed oval spores that were central in position. Based on the biochemical, chemotaxonomic and physiological data, strain 1D(T) appears to be a member of the genus Clostridium. Strain 1D(T) was found to be capable of degrading p-nitrophenol (pNP) at a concentration of 0.5 mM under anaerobic conditions as revealed by HPLC analysis. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 0 )(28.02 %), iso-C(17 : 1) I/anteiso B (23.05 %) and C(14 : 0) (10.02 %). The major polar lipid content was diphosphatidylglycerol. Strain 1D(T) showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Clostridium aciditolerans JW/YJL-B3(T) (98.2 %) and similarity was less for Clostridium scatologenes ATCC 25775(T) (95.1 %), Clostridium drakei SL1(T) (95.0 %) and Clostridium carboxidivorans P7(T) (95.0 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed that it formed a coherent cluster with the species belonging to cluster I of the genus Clostridium. The DNA G+C content was 35.5 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis indicated a mean value of 36.4 % between strain 1D(T) and its closest relative C. aciditolerans. Several phenotypic differences from the closely related species were also revealed. On the basis of the polyphasic characteristics, strain 1D(T) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium nitrophenolicum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 1D(T) (=MTCC 7832(T)=JCM 14030(T)).
TI  - Oscillibacter valericigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a valerate-producing anaerobic bacterium isolated from the alimentary canal of a Japanese corbicula clam.
AB  - A mesophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, strain Sjm18-20(T), was isolated from the alimentary canal of a Japanese corbicula clam. Cells of strain Sjm18-20(T) were Gram-negative, non-sporulating, straight to slightly curved rods, 2.5-6.0 microm long, and were motile with oscillatory movements by means of peritrichous flagella. Cells elongated to 30 microm after prolonged cultivation. Optimum growth was observed at 30 degrees C and pH 6.0-6.5. Growth occurred below 4.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain Sjm18-20(T) produced acid from D-glucose and a few pentoses such as L-arabinose, D-ribose and D-xylose. n-Valeric acid was the major end product from glucose. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Sjm18-20(T) was 52.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene revealed that strain Sjm18-20(T) could be accommodated in clostridial cluster IV of the low-G+C-content Gram-positive bacteria and that the closest neighbour of this organism (92.6-92.9 % similarity) was the cloned 16S rRNA gene sequence of a not-yet cultured bacterium, thought to represent Oscillospira guilliermondii. The nearest cultivated neighbours of strain Sjm18-20(T) were Clostridium orbiscindens DSM 6740(T) and Clostridium viride T2-7(T), with sequence similarities of 91.3 and 89.1 %, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic features and phylogenetic position, it is proposed that this isolate represents a novel species in a new genus, Oscillibacter valericigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Oscillibacter valericigenes is Sjm18-20(T) (=NBRC 101213(T) =DSM 18026(T)).
TI  - Anaerosporobacter mobilis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from forest soil.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium, strain HY-37-4(T), was isolated from a forest-soil sample collected in Jeju, Republic of Korea. The cells were motile rods with peritrichous flagella. Strain HY-37-4(T) fermented various carbohydrates and the end products from glucose were formate, acetate and H(2). The major cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 0), C(16 : 0) 3-OH and iso-C(17 : 1) I/anteiso B. The G+C content of the DNA was 41 mol%. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequence data indicated that the forest isolate was most closely related to Clostridium herbivorans, Clostridium populeti, Clostridium polysaccharolyticum and Eubacterium xylanophilum, which belong to Clostridium cluster XIVa. However, the low levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (92.3-93.9 %) with respect to these taxa indicate that strain HY-37-4(T) represents a novel species. Several phenotypic characteristics readily allowed the isolate to be distinguished from other phylogenetically related taxa. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, strain HY-37-4(T) represents a novel taxon, for which the name Anaerosporobacter mobilis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HY-37-4(T) (=IMSNU 40011(T)=KCTC 5027(T)=DSM 15930(T)).
TI  - Statistical optimization of process parameters on biohydrogen production from glucose by Clostridium sp. Fanp2.
AB  - Statistically based experimental designs were applied to optimizing process parameters for hydrogen production from glucose by Clostridium sp. Fanp2 which was isolated from effluent sludge of anaerobic hydrogen-producing bioreactor. The important factors influencing hydrogen production, which identified by initial screening method of Plackett-Burman, were glucose, phosphate buffer and vitamin solution. The path of steepest ascent was undertaken to approach the optimal region of the three significant factors. Box-Behnken design and response surface analysis were adopted to further investigate the mutual interaction between the variables and identify optimal values that bring maximum hydrogen production. Experimental results showed that glucose, vitamin solution and phosphate buffer concentration all had an individual significant influence on the specific hydrogen production potential (Ps). Simultaneously, glucose and vitamin solution, glucose and phosphate buffer were interdependent. The optimal conditions for the maximal Ps were: glucose 23.75 g/l, phosphate buffer 0.159 M and vitamin solution 13.3 ml/l. Using this statistical optimization method, the hydrogen production from glucose was increased from 2248.5 to 4165.9 ml H2/l.
TI  - Assessment of faecal contamination and the relationship between pathogens and faecal bacterial indicators in an estuarine environment (Seine, France).
AB  - The Seine estuary, one of the largest estuaries of the European northwest continental shelf, is subjected to numerous anthropogenic influences. Here we present an assessment of the microbial faecal contamination of the estuary water. The most vulnerable areas were defined on the basis of the fluxes of indicator organisms and the occurrence of Salmonella and Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. (oo)cysts. The microbial quality of the water changes from upstream to downstream: in the upstream area, contamination by faecal-indicator bacteria and Salmonella occurs during periods of high flow; in the urbanized area, mid-way between the uppermost areas of the estuary and its mouth, discharge from a wastewater treatment plant and a tributary degrade water quality; at the estuary mouth, the accumulation of microorganisms attached to particles in the maximum turbidity zone, particularly Clostridium perfringens spores and oocysts of Cryptosporidium, is accompanied by inputs of ThC and Escherichia coli from tributaries. In some areas, significant strong relations are observed between Salmonella, (oo)cysts of protozoan, and levels of faecal indicators.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - Removal of proteases from Clostridium perfringens fermented broth by aqueous two-phase systems (PEG/citrate).
AB  - In order to reduce the toxicity of Clostridium perfringens fermentation broths used in vaccine preparation, we developed two-phase aqueous systems for removal of toxin-activating proteases. Removal of the proteases inhibits the conversion of protoxin to active toxin. In order to establish the conditions under which the phase separation occurs, binodal curves, formed by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and sodium citrate, were investigated at different values of pH and PEG molar mass. A 2(4)-experimental design was used to evaluate the influence of PEG molar mass and concentration, citrate concentration and pH on protease partition coefficient, removal.factor and protease removal yield. It has been found that simultaneous increase in PEG molar mass and decrease in citrate concentration remarkably improved the removal factor, whereas the protease removal yield showed an opposite trend. The best conditions for the system under consideration (removal factor of 2.69 and yield of 116%) were obtained at pH 8.0 using PEG molar mass of 8000 g mol(-1) and concentrations of PEG and citrate of 24 and 15%, respectively.
TI  - Clostridium aestuarii sp. nov., from tidal flat sediment.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, halophilic, motile, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain HY-45-18(T), was isolated from a sediment sample of a tidal flat in Korea. The isolate produced butyric acid, propionic acid, glycerol and H(2) as fermentation end products from glucose. Strain HY-45-18(T) is halophilic as it was unable to grow in the absence of sea salts. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis clearly indicated that the tidal flat isolate is a member of cluster I of the order Clostridiales, which contains the type species of Clostridium, Clostridium butyricum. The closest phylogenetic neighbour of strain HY-45-18(T) was Clostridium ganghwense KCTC 5146(T) (96.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Several phenotypic characteristics can be readily used to differentiate the isolate from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strain HY-45-18(T) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HY-45-18(T) (=IMSNU 40129(T)=KCTC 5147(T)=JCM 13194(T)).
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  - The development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. The important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. Systematic monitoring of fecal bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. Clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. The temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees C, compared with the 4 degrees C location, where these species were found in lower numbers. Moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas was found only at this last location. The temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of Campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a pH close to 6. Spore forms of C. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.
TI  - Dominance of endospore-forming bacteria on a Rotating Activated Bacillus Contactor biofilm for advanced wastewater treatment.
AB  - The bacterial diversity inherent to the biofilm community structure of a modified rotating biological contactor wastewater treatment process, referred to as the Rotating Activated Bacillus Contactor (RABC) process, was characterized in this study, via both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. On the basis of culture-dependent methods, Bacillus sp. were found to exist in large numbers on the biofilm (6.5% of the heterotrophic bacteria) and the microbial composition of the biofilms was quite simple. Only three phyla were identified-namely, the Proteobacteria, the Actinobacteria (High G+C Gram-positive bacteria), and the Firmicutes (Low G+C Gram-positive bacteria). The culture-independent partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed a considerably more diverse microbial composition within the biofilms. A total of eight phyla were recovered in this case, three of which were major groups: the Firmicutes (43.9%), the Proteobacteria (28.6%), and the Bacteroidetes (17.6%). The remaining five phyla were minor groups: the Planctomycetes (4.4%), the Chlorobi (2.2%), the Actinobacteria (1.1%), the Nitrospirae (1.1%), and the Verrucomicrobia (1.1%). The two most abundant genera detected were the endospore-forming bacteria (31.8%), Clostridium and Bacillus, both of which are members of the Firmicutes phylum. This finding indicates that these endospore-forming bacteria successfully colonized and dominated the RABC process biofilms. Many of the colonies or clones recovered from the biofilms evidenced significantly high homology in the 16S rDNA sequences of bacteria stored in databases associated with advanced wastewater treatment capabilities, including nitrification and denitrification, phosphorus accumulation, the removal of volatile odors, and the removal of chlorohydrocarbons or heavy metals. The microbial community structures observed in the biofilms were found to correlate nicely with the enhanced performance of advanced wastewater treatment protocols.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an extracellular protease produced by psychrotolerant Clostridium sp. LP3 from lake sediment of Leh, India.
AB  - An anaerobic, proteolytic bacterium isolated from lake sediments of Leh, India, was characterized with respect to morphology, biochemical characteristics, and 16S rRNA sequence and was identified as Clostridium species, with closest similarity to Clostridium subterminale. Isolate LP3 was psychrophilic, forming maximum cell mass between 10 and 20 degrees C, and produced extracellular protease. Growth was observed in the pH range of 7.0-8.5, with optimum at pH 7.5. Protease was purified 62.4-fold with a total yield of 17.5%. The effects of temperature, pH, and salt concentration on enzyme activity were studied. Protease was found to be a serine-type metallo-enzyme, active in a broad range of pHs. It was thermolabile and resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Enzyme kinetics showed a tendency to increase Km with an increase in temperature for casein substrate.
TI  - Characterization of an antibiotic resistant Clostridium hathewayi strain from a continuous-flow exclusion chemostat culture derived from the cecal contents of a feral pig.
AB  - The chemostat model has been an important tool in studying intestinal microflora. To date, several competitive exclusion products have been developed from such studies as prophylactic treatment against pathogenic bacteria. A continuous-flow chemostat model of a feral pig was developed using inocula from the cecal contents of a wild boar caught in East Texas. Several strains of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria were isolated including Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Clostridium sp. This study reports on the characterization of a multidrug-resistant Clostridium hathewayi strain that was isolated from this feral pig's cecal contents maintained in a continuous-flow chemostat system showing high resistance to carbapenems and macrolides (including the growth promoter tylosin). Clostridium hathewayi has been documented to be pathogenic to both humans and animals. Feral pigs may be an important source of pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and may pose potential risk to domestic species. Further work is needed to elucidate the prevalence of these reservoirs and assess the contribution these may play in the spread of disease and resistance.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Mortality in Pennsylvania captive elk (Cervus elaphus): 1998-2006.
AB  - The necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. The animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate Pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. The most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). The cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65 elk. Nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), Escherichia coli (3 cases), and Streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. Fungal organisms, consistent with Aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. Bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included Clostridium perfringens (2 cases), E. coli (1 case), Salmonella Newport (1 case) and Salmonella Thompson (1 case). The majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this age range. In conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of a high-rate hydrogen-producing microbial community in anaerobic agitated granular sludge bed bioreactors using glucose as substrate.
AB  - Fermentative H(2) production microbial structure in an agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). This hydrogen-producing system was operated at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 h and with an influent glucose concentration of 20 g chemical oxygen demand/l. According to the PCR-DGGE analysis, bacterial community structures were mainly composed of Clostridium sp. (possibly Clostridium pasteurianum), Klebsiella oxytoca, and Streptococcus sp. Significant increase of Clostridium/total cell ratio (68%) was observed when the reactor was operated under higher influent flow rate. The existence of Streptococcus sp. in the reactor became more important when operated under a short HRT as indicated by the ratio of Streptococcus probe-positive cells to Clostridium probe-positive cells changing from 21% (HRT 4 h) to 38% (HRT 0.5 h). FISH images suggested that Streptococcus cells probably acted as seeds for self-flocculated granule formation. Furthermore, combining the inspections with hydrogen production under different HRTs and their corresponding FISH analysis indicated that K. oxytoca did not directly contribute to H(2) production but possibly played a role in consuming O(2) to create an anaerobic environment for the hydrogen-producing Clostridium.
TI  - Peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., Peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and Anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. isolated from clinical specimens of human origin.
AB  - Three groups of previously unknown gram-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Phenotypic and genotypic data demonstrate that these organisms are distinct, and each group represents a previously unknown subline within Clostridium cluster XIII. Two groups are most closely related to Peptoniphilus harei in the genus Peptoniphilus, and the other group is most closely related to Anaerococcus lactolyticus in the genus Anaerococcus. Based on the findings, three novel species, Peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., Peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and Anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov., are proposed. The type strains of Peptoniphilus gorbachii sp. nov., Peptoniphilus olsenii sp. nov., and Anaerococcus murdochii sp. nov. are WAL 10418(T) (= CCUG 53341(T) = ATCC BAA-1383(T)), WAL 12922(T) (= CCUG 53342(T) = ATCC BAA-1384(T)), and WAL 17230(T) (= CCUG 53340(T) = ATCC BAA-1385(T)), respectively.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea in the intensive care unit.
AB  - We made an epidemiological case-control study to examine risk factors for the development of diarrhea in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a public hospital in Santo Andre, SP, from January to October 2002. Forty-nine patients with diarrhea (cases) and 49 patients without diarrhea (controls), matched for age and gender, were included in the study. A stool culture and enzyme immunoassays for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B were performed on fecal specimens from diarrhea patients. Fourteen of them presented positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 22 patients presented positive ELISA for Clostridium difficile. Nosocomial diarrhea was associated with several factors, including use of antibiotics (P=0.001), use of ceftriaxone (P=0.001), presence of infection (P=0.010) and length of hospital stay (P=0.0001).
TI  - Moryella indoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Three Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria with pointed ends were isolated from clinical specimens. The organisms were weakly saccharolytic and produced indole, acetate, butyrate and lactate as major metabolic end products. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolates had no known close relatives among recognized bacteria but that they exhibited a phylogenetic association with Clostridium rRNA cluster XIVa [as defined by Collins, M. D. et al. (1994). Int J Syst Bacteriol 44, 812-826]. The closest recognized relatives were the type strains of Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium bolteae and Clostridium asparagiforme (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 90.2-91.4 %). These results suggest that these three clinical isolates represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Moryella indoligenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Moryella indoligenes is AIP 220.04(T) (=CIP 109174(T)=CCUG 52648(T)).
TI  - Enhanced isomer purity of lactic acid from the non-sterile fermentation of kitchen wastes.
AB  - In order to improve the purity of lactic acid isomers, the effects of pH, temperature, fermentation time and their interactions on l(+) or d(-)-lactic acid production were evaluated during lactic acid fermentation of the non-sterile kitchen wastes. The results showed that l(+)-lactic acid was the main isomeric form. The isomer purity was much higher at acidic or alkalic pH (non-controlled pH, pH 5 and pH 8) than neutral pH (pH 6 and pH 7). Increasing the fermentation temperature from 35 degrees C to 45 degrees C at pH 7 enhanced the isomer purity from 60:40 to 83:17. The optimal fermentation time for the purity of lactic acid isomers was found to depend on the corresponding pH and temperature. From the response surface analysis, the optimized combination of pH and temperature could obviously increase the l(+)-isomer concentration. It is confirmed that the variation of the isomer purity with pH, temperature and fermentation time change resulted from the substitution of microbial community composition. The lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium sp. dominated the fermentation of non-sterile kitchen wastes, and the emergence and disappearance of lactic acid bacteria which produced l(+)-isomer and Clostridium sp. resulted in the variations of the isomer purity.
TI  - [Isolation and characterization of H2-producing strains Enterobacter sp. and Clostridium sp].
AB  - Two hydrogen-producing bacterial strains were newly isolated and identified as Enterobacter sp. Z-16 and Clostridium sp. C-32 by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Various parameters for hydrogen production, including substrates, initial pH and temperature, have been studied. The optimum condition for hydrogen production of strain Z-16 were achieved as: initial pH7.0, temperature 35 degrees C , sucrose as the favorite substrate. In comparison, The optimum condition for hydrogen production of strain C-32 were obtained as: initial pH8.0, temperature 35 degrees C , maltose as the favorite substrate . Under batch fermentative hydrogen production conditions, the maximal hydrogen conversion rate for strain Z-16 and strain C-32 were 2.68 mol H2/mol sucrose and 2.71mol H2/mol maltose, respectively. Using glucose as substrate, the hydrogen conversion rate of strain Z-16 and strain C-32 were 2.35 and 2.48 mol H2/mol glucose, respectively. This research suggest a good application potential of strain Z-16 and C-32 in the future biological hydrogen production.
TI  - Digestive tract microbiota in healthy volunteers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from Brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. METHODS: Microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. Collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. RESULTS: (i) Mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the esophagus; (iii) Veillonella sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed Bacteroides sp, Proteus sp, and Staphylococcus sp, in addition to Veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria Veillonella sp (average 10(5) UFC) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. CONCLUSIONS: The collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. These procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.
TI  - Biotransformation of 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzene arsonic acid (roxarsone) and release of inorganic arsenic by Clostridium species.
AB  - The extensive use of 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzene arsonic acid (roxarsone) in the production of broiler chickens can lead to increased soil arsenic concentration and arsenic contaminated dust. While roxarsone is the dominant arsenic species in fresh litter, inorganic As (V) predominates in composted litter. Microbial activity has been implicated as the cause, but neither the specific processes nor the organisms have been identified. Here we demonstrate the rapid biotransformation of roxarsone under anaerobic conditions by Clostridium species in chicken litter enrichments and a pure culture of a fresh water arsenate respiring species (Clostridium sp. strain OhILAs). The main products were 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzene arsonic acid and inorganic arsenic. Growth experiments and genomic analysis indicate strain OhILAs may use roxarsone as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration. Electronic structure analysis suggests that the reducing equivalents should go to the nitro group, while liberation of inorganic arsenic from the intact benzene ring by cleaving the C-As bond is unlikely. Clostridium and Lactobacillus species are common in the chicken cecum and litter. Thus, the organic-rich manure and anaerobic conditions typically associated with composting provide the conditions necessary for the native microbial populations to transform the roxarsone in the litter releasing the more toxic inorganic arsenic.
TI  - Clostridium aciditolerans sp. nov., an acid-tolerant spore-forming anaerobic bacterium from constructed wetland sediment.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic, spore-forming, moderately acid-tolerant bacterium, strain JW/YJL-B3T, was isolated from a sediment sample from a constructed wetland system receiving acid sulfate water. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate belonged to the Firmicutes branch with Clostridium drakei SL1T (96.2 % gene sequence similarity) as its closest relative. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 30.8 mol% (HPLC). Cells were straight to curved rods, 0.5-1.0 microm in diameter and 3.0-9.0 microm in length. The temperature range for growth was 20-45 degrees C, with an optimum around 35 degrees C. Growth was not detected below 18 degrees C or above 47 degrees C. The pH range for growth was broad, pH(25 degrees C) 3.8-8.9, with an optimum at 7.0-7.5. However at pH 4.5, the strain grew at 52 % of the optimal growth rate. The salinity range was 0-1.5 % NaCl (w/v). Strain JW/YJL-B3T utilized beef extract, Casamino acids, peptone, tryptone, arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, raffinose, ribose, sucrose, xylose, pyruvate, glutamate and inulin as a carbon and energy source. There were no indications of growth under aerobic or autotrophic conditions. The isolate produced acetate, butyrate and ethanol as fermentation end products from glucose. Based on these characteristics and other physiological properties, the isolate is placed into the novel taxon, Clostridium aciditolerans sp. nov., with strain JW/YJL-B3T (=DSM 17425T=ATCC BAA-1220T) as the type strain.
TI  - Clostridium saccharogumia sp. nov. and Lactonifactor longoviformis gen. nov., sp. nov., two novel human faecal bacteria involved in the conversion of the dietary phytoestrogen secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - Two anaerobic bacteria involved in the conversion of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were isolated from faeces of a healthy male adult. The first isolate, strain SDG-Mt85-3Db, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive helically coiled rod. Based on 16S r RNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium cocleatum (96.7% similarity) and Clostridium ramosum (96.6%). In contrast to these species, the isolate was devoid of alpha-galactosidase and -glucosidase and did not grow on maltose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and trehalose. The hypothesis that strain SDG-Mt85-3Db represents a new bacterial species of the Clostridium cluster XVIII was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments. The G+C content of DNA of strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (30.7+/-0.8 mol%) was comparable with that of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. The name Clostridium saccharogumia is proposed for strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (=DSM 17460T=CCUG 51486T). The second isolate, strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive regular rod. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium amygdalinum (93.3%), Clostridium saccharolyticum (93.1%) and Ruminococcus productus (93.0%). The isolate differed from these species in its ability to dehydrogenate enterodiol. It also possessed alpha-arabinosidase and -galactosidase and had a higher G+C content of DNA (48.0 mol%). According to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel genus, Lactonifactor, and a novel species, Lactonifactor longoviformis, to accommodate strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6. The type strain is DSM 17459T (=CCUG 51487T).
TI  - Molecular analyses of the intestinal microbiota of chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity.
AB  - Little information is available regarding the intestinal bacteria of chimpanzees  in the wild, due to the technical difficulties of studying intestinal bacteria in the field. In this study, molecular-based bacterial analyses were performed to overcome this difficulty because polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be applied to ethanol-fixed fecal samples. The common presence of bacteria belonging to the Clostridium rRNA sub-group XIVa, such as Ruminococcus obeum and Eubacterium sp., was indicated for Bossou wild chimpanzees by ARDRA. TGGE on partial 16S rDNA followed by hierarchical clustering analysis showed a systematic difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota between wild and captive chimpanzees. However, several TGGE bands commonly shared by wild and captured chimpanzees were excised, and their sequences were obtained. They were suggested to be the Clostridium leptum subgroup bacteria, Lactobacillus gasseri-like bacterium, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum- or B. catenulatum-like bacterium. These may be considered as common intestinal bacteria for chimpanzees, and may be transmitted vertically over generations.
TI  - [Influence of selected Lactobacillus sp. on Clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  - This study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. (L. plantarum 2017405, L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus DSM 21007 and L. fernmentumn 353) on Clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. Forty strains C. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) were used. Among C. difficile strains 13 produced toxin A and B (A+B+CDT-), 14 produced only toxin B (AB'CDT), 9 produced toxins A and B and possessing of binary toxin genes (A+B+CDT-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (A-B-CDT-). We did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity Lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of C. difficile strains.
TI  - Catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from blood cultures of patients from Hong Kong and Canada.
AB  - Four bacterial isolates were recovered from the blood cultures of four patients,  two of whom were from Hong Kong and two of whom were from Canada. The two Hong Kong strains were isolated from a 48-year-old man with intestinal obstruction and secondary sepsis (strain HKU16T) and from a 39-year-old man with acute appendicitis (strain HKU17), while the two Canadian strains were isolated from a 74-year-old man with biliary sepsis (strain CA1) and from a 66-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma and sepsis (strain CA2). While the first three patients survived, the last patient died 2 weeks after the episode of bacteremia. All four isolates are strictly anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive coccobacilli that were unidentified by conventional phenotypic tests and commercial identification systems. They grow on sheep blood agar as nonhemolytic pinpoint colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic environment. All are catalase positive and motile, with flagella. They produce acid from arabinose, glucose, mannose, and xylose. They do not produce indole or reduce nitrate. They are sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole but resistant to cefotaxime. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed 16.0%, 16.8%, and 21.0% base differences from Clostridium propionicum, Clostridium neopropionicum, and Atopobium minutum, respectively. The G+C content of strain HKU16T is 40.2% +/- 2.2%. Based on their phylogenetic affiliation, unique G+C content, and phenotypic characteristics, we propose a new genus and species, Catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., to describe the bacterium, for which HKU16 is the type strain, and suggest that it be assigned to a new family, Catabacteriaceae. The gastrointestinal tract was probably the source of the bacterium for at least three of the four patients. The isolation of a catalase-positive, motile, nonsporulating, anaerobic gram-positive bacillus in clinical laboratories should raise the possibility of C. hongkongensis. Further studies should be performed to ascertain the epidemiology and other disease associations of this bacterium.
TI  - [A study to assess the microbial contamination of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St Lawrence River estuary, (Quebec, Canada)].
AB  - The aims of the present study were to assess the microbial quality of Mya arenaria clams from the north shore of the St. Lawrence River estuary and to validate various microbial indicator microorganisms of bivalve mollusks contamination. Clams were collected from nine sites, including four harvesting sites closed by virtue of the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). Six contamination indicators (fecal coliforms, somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, fecal streptococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli) and four pathogens (Campylobacter sp., Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia sp., and Salmonella sp.) were identified in the clams. Indicators sensibility, specificity and predictive values with respect to the presence of pathogens were calculated. Pathogenic microorganisms detection frequency in clams was important (92%). Globally, pathogens tend to be less frequently detected in opened harvesting sites (p = 0.086). Although the assessed indicators were not perfect, when F-specific coliphages are associated with E. coli or fecal coliforms, a good sensibility (62%-64%) and good positive predictive value (88%) with respect to the investigated pathogens are obtained.
TI  - Development of an immunodetection test for a botulinum-like neurotoxin produced by Clostridium sp. RKD.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Clostridial neurotoxins are among the most toxic substances known and cause severe illnesses in both humans and animals. A neurotoxigenic Clostridium sp. (strain RKD) isolated from intestine of decaying fish produced a novel, botulinum type B like neurotoxin as suggested by mouse bioassay, protection with anti-botulinum antibodies and PCR. The aim of the present investigation was to develop a laboratory based detection assay as an alternative to the mouse bioassay without compromising sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: Growth and toxin production were carried out in trypticase peptone yeast-extract glucose (TPYG) broth. Toxicity was estimated in terms of minimum lethal dose (MLD) by mouse bioassay. The toxin was partially purified by acid precipitation. It was used for toxoid preparation by formaldehyde treatment. This purified IgG was used for detection of neurotoxin using indirect ELISA. The culture supernatant was concentrated using a stirred cell with a 50 kDa cut-off membrane at 4 degrees C. Further purification was carried out using Prep cell. Fractions showing toxicity and sufficient purity were pooled, concentrated and analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). RESULTS: The toxin was purified with a recovery of 8.56 per cent. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in mice using partially purified toxin with a titre of 1: 80000. A detection assay with sensitivity of approximately 15 and 300 ng/ml for partially purified and crude toxins, respectively were achieved using an indirect ELISA method. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The Clostridium sp. RKD produced a potent neurotoxin earlier shown to have novelties. A specific detection assay for the neurotoxin has been developed that may be useful both from food safety and clinical point of view.
TI  - Anaerovirgula multivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel spore-forming, alkaliphilic anaerobe isolated from Owens Lake, California, USA.
AB  - A novel, alkaliphilic, obligately anaerobic bacterium, strain SCAT, was isolated  from mud sediments of a soda lake in California, USA. The rod-shaped cells were motile, Gram-positive, formed spores and were 0.4-0.5x2.5-5.0 microm in size. Growth occurred within the pH range 6.7-10.0 and was optimal at pH 8.5. The temperature range for growth was 10-45 degrees C, with optimal growth at 35 degrees C. NaCl was required for growth. Growth occurred at 0.5-9.0% (w/v) NaCl and was optimal at 1-2% (w/v). The novel isolate was a catalase-negative chemo-organoheterotroph that fermented sugars, proteolysis products, some organic and amino acids, glycerol, d-cellobiose and cellulose. It was also capable of growth by the Stickland reaction. Strain SCAT was sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and gentamicin, but it was resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 34.2 mol%. Major fatty acid components were C14:0, iso-C15:0, C16:1omega9c and C16:0. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain SCAT showed a similarity of approximately 97% with the type strains of Clostridium formicaceticum and Clostridium aceticum in clostridial cluster XI and a similarity of less than 94.2% to any other recognized Clostridium species and those of related genera in this cluster. Strain SCAT was clearly differentiated from C. formicaceticum and C. aceticum based on comparison of their phenotypic properties and fatty acid profiles, as well as low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain SCAT and the type strains of these two species. Therefore, strain SCAT is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, Anaerovirgula multivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., in clostridial cluster XI. The type strain is SCAT (=ATCC BAA-1084T=JCM 12857T=DSM 17722T=CIP 107910T).
TI  - In vitro killing of nosocomial pathogens by acid and acidified nitrite.
AB  - Exposure to pH 1 or 2 buffers or acidic gastric contents resulted in the killing  of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata but not Clostridium difficile spores. Nitrite enhanced killing under acidic conditions, but significant killing of C. difficile spores required nitrite concentrations above usual physiological levels.
TI  - Effect of chitosan on the growth of human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Growth of 6 bacterial strains representing dominant members of the human colonic  microflora was measured in the presence of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.5 % chitosan (from shrimp shells, with a 97 % final degree of deacetylation). The effect of chitosan was variable and dependent on bacterial species. The most susceptible to chitosan were bacteria belonging to genera Bacteroides and Clostridium (91-97% growth inhibition). On the other hand, Roseburia sp., Eubacterium sp. and Faecalibacterium sp. were more resistant (63-83 % inhibition of growth). Chitosan can thus be considered as one of the means for influencing the bacterial population in the human colon.
TI  - The effect of decreasing alkalinity on microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor as analyzed by PCR-SSCP.
AB  - PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and Southern blotting techniques were adopted to investigate microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor caused by decreasing influent alkalinity. Experimental results indicated that the sulfate-removal rate approached 87% in 25 d under the conditions of influent alkalinity of 4000 mg/L (as CaCO3) and sulfate-loading rate of 4.8 g/(L*d), which indicated that the bioreactor started up successfully. The analysis of microbial community structure in this stage showed that Lactococcus sp., Anaerofilum sp. and Kluyvera sp. were dominant populations. It was found that when influent alkalinity reduced to 1000 mg/L, sulfate-removal rate decreased rapidly to 35% in 3 d. Then influent alkalinity was increased to 3000 mg/L, the sulfate-removal rate rose to 55%. Under these conditions, the populations of Dysgonomonas sp., Sporobacte sp., Obesumbacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. got to rich, which predominated in the community together with Lactococcus sp., Anaerofilum sp. and Kluyvera sp. However, when the alkalinity was decreased to 1500 mg/L, the sulfate-removal rate rose to and kept stable at 70% and populations of Dysgonomonas sp., Sporobacter sp. and Obesumbacterium sp. died out, while some strains of Desulfovibrio sp. and Clostridium sp. increased in concentration. In order to determine the minimum alkalinity value that the system could tolerate, the influent alkalinity was decreased from 1500 to 400 mg/L secondly. This resulted in the sulfate-removal rate, pH value and effluent alkalinity dropping quickly. The amount of Petrotoga sp., Prevotella sp., Kluyvera sp. and Neisseria sp. reduced obviously. The result data from Southern blotting indicated that the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) decreased with influent alkalinity dropping. Analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity showed that the SRBs populations were very abundant in the inoculated activated sludge and the alkalinity decrease caused the reduction of the populations noted. Most of resident populations in the bioreactor were fermentative acidogenic bacteria (FABs), among which the phylum Firmicute was in the majority, but SRBs were very few. This community structure demonstrates the cooperation between SRBs and FABs, which sustains the system's high sulfate-removal and operation stability.
TI  - The detection of environmental autoinducing peptide quorum-sensing genes from an  uncultured Clostridium sp. in landfill leachate reactor biomass.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate whether a dominant uncultured clostridial (Clostridium thermocellum-like) species in an environmental sample (landfill leachate), possesses an autoinducing peptide (AIP) quorum-sensing (QS) gene, although it may not be functional. METHODS AND RESULTS: A modified AIP accessory gene regulator (agr)C PCR protocol was performed on extracted DNA from a landfill leachate sample (also characterized by 16S rRNA gene cloning) and the PCR products were cloned, sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. It appeared that two agrC gene phylotypes existed, most closely related to the C. thermocellum agrC gene, differing by only 1 bp. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to specifically identify and characterize the agrC AIP QS gene from uncultured Firmicutes (C. thermocellum-like) bacteria derived from environmental (landfill leachate) sample. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first successful attempt at identifying AIP QS genes from a cellulolytic environment (landfill). The agrC gene was identified as being most closely related to the C. thermocellum agrC gene, the same bacterium identified as being dominant, according to 16S rRNA gene cloning and subsequently fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, in the same biomass.
TI  - Clostridium sp. bacteremia in a cirrhotic patient with an unresecable hepatocellular carcinoma: as fatal as we thought?
AB  
TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Gracilibacter thermotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, thermotolerant bacterium from a constructed wetland receiving acid sulfate water.
AB  - An obligatorily anaerobic, thermotolerant, asporogenic bacterium, strain JW/YJL-S1(T), was isolated from a sediment sample of a constructed wetland system receiving acid sulfate water (pH 1.6-3.0). Cells of strain JW/YJL-S1(T) were straight to curved rods 0.2-0.4 mum in diameter and 2.0-7.0 mum in length, and stained Gram-negative. Growth of strain JW/YJL-S1(T) was observed at 25-54 degrees C (no growth at or below 20 or at or above 58 degrees C), with an optimum temperature range for growth of 42.5-46.5 degrees C. The pH(25 degrees C) range for growth was 6.0-8.25 (no growth at or below pH 5.7 or at or above pH 8.5), with optimum growth at pH 6.8-7.75. The salinity range for growth was 0-1.5 % (w/v) NaCl, with an optimum at 0-0.5 %. During growth on glucose the isolate produced acetate, lactate and ethanol as main fermentation end products. The fatty acid composition was dominated by branched-chain compounds: i15 : 0, a15 : 0, i16 : 0 and i17 : 0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.8 mol% (HPLC). Strain JW/YJL-S1(T) showed polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene. Its closest relative was the thermophilic Clostridium thermosuccinogenes DSM 5807(T) (a member of Clostridium cluster III) (a blastn search revealed Clostridium pascui DSM 10365(T) to have 92.7 % gene sequence similarity, the highest value). The inferred phylogenetic trees placed strain JW/YJL-S1(T) between Clostridium clusters I/II and III. Based on the morphological and phylogenetic data presented, JW/YJL-S1(T) (=DSM 17427(T)=ATCC BAA-1219(T)) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species in a new genus, Gracilibacter thermotolerans gen. nov., sp. nov.
TI  - Immunohistochemical evidence of Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, and group  A Streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  - Severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (IHC) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft tissue infections in Scotland and Ireland in 2000. The IHC assays used antibodies against Clostridium sp, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Bacillus anthracis. Intact bacilli and granular Clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. A variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 IHC-positive cases. Staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where S aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. Group A streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which Streptococcus pyogenes and S aureus were isolated. By using IHC, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. Immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as Clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.
TI  - Congener specific polychlorinated biphenyl metabolism by human intestinal microbe species: Comparison with human liver cell line-HepG2.
AB  - Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), which adversely affect human fetal and infant development, are endocrine disrupter and cause neurological disorders. They may also be carcinogenic. It is not known whether these effects are due to whole PCBs or to its metabolites, produced by the human gastrointestinal system primarily the liver and/or by intestinal microbes such as Clostridium sp. The available data show that Clostridium perfringens, the most prominent species of Clostridium occurs in the human gut. C. beijerinckii is a special type of Clostridium present in the gut of autistic children with late onset autism. Since mixed cultures are better PCB metabolizers than single cultures, mixed cultures of Clostridium were used in this work. The first step in PCB degradation is the removal of the chlorine atoms and then the breaking open of the phenyl ring leading to the final degradation product: CO2. In this study, GC-MS analyses were done to examine the effect of Clostridium sp. on PCB-153 and PCB-77 and the metabolites obtained with Clostridium sp. therein. In this paper, we report that the unlike human liver cells which cannot produce any PCB metabolites. Mixed Clostridium spp. can degrade these PCBs. Clostridium spp. and were able to dechlorinate PCB 153 (hexachlorobiphenyl) to pentachlorobiphenyl and PCB 77 (tetrachlorobiphenyl) to trichlorobiphenyl. Despite considerable absorption of PCB 153 (40%) and PCB 77 (50%) in 30 minutes and 1.5 hours respectively by human liver (HepG2) cells, they can not dechlorinate PCBs. It has been observed that slight differences in chemical structures of PCBs such as coplanar (PCB-77) vs. non-coplanar (PCB-153) has significant metabolic effects.
TI  - Assessing optimal fermentation type for bio-hydrogen production in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors.
AB  - In this study, the optimal fermentation type and the operating conditions of anaerobic process in continuous-flow acidogenic reactors was investigated for the maximization of bio-hydrogen production using mixed cultures. Butyric acid type fermentation occurred at pH>6, propionic acid type fermentation occurred at pH about 5.5 with E(h) (redox potential) >-278mV, and ethanol-type fermentation occurred at pH<4.5. The representative strains of these fermentations were Clostridium sp., Propionibacterium sp. and Bacteriodes sp., respectively. Ethanol fermentation was optimal type by comparing the operating stabilities and hydrogen production capacities between the fermentation types, which remained stable when the organic loading rate (OLR) reached the highest OLR at 86.1kgCOD/m(3)d. The maximum hydrogen production reached up to 14.99L/d.
TI  - In vitro prebiotic effects of Acacia gums onto the human intestinal microbiota depends on both botanical origin and environmental pH.
AB  - Acacia gums are commonly used food additives. It is currently unclear how extensively these non-digestible polysaccharides are fermented in the human large intestine. However, they have been shown to support bifidobacterial growth in vitro and may represent useful candidate prebiotics. In these investigations, in vitro 24-h batch incubations and chemostat continuous-cultures of human faecal bacteria were conducted using two acacia gums (Fibregum standard and Fibregum AS). Our aim was to study the effects of these gums on bacterial ecology and fermentation in the large bowel. Fructooligosaccharides (Actilight-950P) were also investigated as a reference. Both Acacia gums were extensively fermented by intestinal flora although there were marked differences in fermentation product formation and ecological effects, probably due to their differing botanical origins and/or biochemical characteristics. In particular, fermentation of Fibregum AS led to significantly higher proportions of propionate both in batch and chemostat experiments. Both gums decreased Clostridium sp. levels but only Fibregum-standard induced higher Lactobacillus sp. counts compared to control. These bacterial modifications were highly dependent of the operating pH of the fermentation system with acidic conditions promoting both the prebiotic and the butyrogenic effects of fructooligosaccharides. In these studies, we have demonstrated that, similarly to fructooligosaccharides, Acacia gums can exert putatively beneficial effects on host health through both the improvement of the composition of the large intestine microflora and SCFA formation.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as probiotics.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium sp, Saccharomyces boulardii, and some other microbes have been proposed as and are used as probiotic strains, i.e. live microorganisms as food supplement in order to benefit health. The health claims range from rather vague as regulation of bowel activity and increasing of well-being to more specific, such as exerting antagonistic effect on the gastroenteric pathogens Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori and rotavirus, neutralising food mutagens produced in colon, shifting the immune response towards a Th2 response, and thereby alleviating allergic reactions, and lowering serum cholesterol (Tannock, 2002). Unfortunately, most publications are case reports, uncontrolled studies in humans, or reports of animal or in vitro studies. Whether or not the probiotic strains employed shall be of human origin is a matter of debate but this is not a matter of concern, as long as the strains can be shown to survive the transport in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and to colonise the human large intestine. This includes survival in the stressful environment of the stomach - acidic pH and bile - with induction of new genes encoding a number of stress proteins. Since the availability of antioxidants decreases rostrally in the GI tract production of antioxidants by colonic bacteria provides a beneficial effect in scavenging free radicals. LAB strains commonly produce antimicrobial substance(s) with activity against the homologous strain, but LAB strains also often produce microbicidal substances with effect against gastric and intestinal pathogens and other microbes, or compete for cell surface and mucin binding sites. This could be the mechanism behind reports that some probiotic strains inhibit or decrease translocation of bacteria from the gut to the liver. A protective effect against cancer development can be ascribed to binding of mutagens by intestinal bacteria, reduction of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and deconjugation of bile acids, or merely by enhancing the immune system of the host. The latter has attracted considerable interest, and LAB have been tested in several clinical trials in allergic diseases. Characteristics ascribed to a probiotic strain are in general strain specific, and individual strains have to be tested for each property. Survival of strains during production, packing and storage of a viable cell mass has to be tested and declared.
TI  - Purification and characterization of chitinases from Clostridium sp. E-16 isolated from the intestinal tract of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens).
AB  - AIMS: This study was undertaken to examine the properties of chitinases purified  from Clostridium sp. E-16, an intestinal bacterium of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens). We also elucidated the taxonomic status of this bacterium to better understand the role of intestinal anaerobic bacteria in marine animals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two chitinases were purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography and preparative electrophoresis from culture supernatant fluid from Clostridium sp. E-16. Molecular mass was estimated to be 77 kDa for chitinase 1 and 98 kDa for chitinase 2 by SDS-PAGE. Optimum pH of both purified chitinases was between 5.0 and 7.0. Chitinase 1 was inhibited with Cu(2+), Fe(2+), Hg(2+) and Zn(2+), while chitinase 2 was inhibited with Fe(2+). Phylogenetic analysis using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and phenotypic characterization revealed that Clostridium sp. E-16 was closely related to Clostridium baratii. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that chitinases from C. baratii or a C. baratii-like bacterium play an important role in degradation of chitin in the intestinal tract of the South American sea lion and in marine environments. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of chitinase purification and characterization from a marine Clostridium strain.
TI  - Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum sp. nov., a glycyrrhizin-hydrolysing bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Screening of faecal bacteria for glycyrrhetic acid (GA) production by hydrolysing of glycyrrhizin (GL) resulted in the isolation of two strains, designated ZM35T and ZM38. Strains ZM35T and ZM38 were Gram-positive, obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacteria. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strains ZM35T and ZM38 belonged to cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains ZM35T and ZM38 were identical. Strain ZM35T exhibited approximately 94% to 95% identity with the validly described species, Clostridium oroticum(94.5%), Eubacterium contortum(93.8%), Ruminococcus gnavus(94.5%) and R. torques(95.1%). In an experiment of DNA-DNA hybridization, it was confirmed that strains ZM35T and ZM38 were the same species. The guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content of strain ZM35T is 45.7 mol%. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic findings, we propose that strains ZM35T and ZM38 be assigned to a novel species named Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum. The type strain is ZM35T (=JCM 13368T=DSM 17593T).
TI  - Clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and Clostridium citroniae sp. nov. isolated from human clinical infections.
AB  - One hundred eight isolates were previously identified in our laboratory as Clostridium clostridioforme by colonial and cellular morphology, as well as biochemical tests. Recent studies have indicated that there are actually three different species in this C. clostridioforme group: C. hathewayi, C. bolteae, and C. clostridioforme. Our isolates were reexamined using biochemical and enzymatic tests and molecular methods. Forty-six isolates were reidentified as C. hathewayi, 34 as C. bolteae, five as C. clostridioforme, and one as C. symbiosum. Twenty-two strains were identified only to the genus level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and although they are microscopically and morphologically indistinguishable from the above-mentioned three species, they are phenotypically different and only 96 to 98% similar by gene sequencing. Twenty of these 22 strains were indole positive and formed two novel species. We propose Clostridium aldenense sp. nov. and Clostridium citroniae sp. nov. as names for these new species. They are differentiated from each other by results for raffinose, rhamnose, alpha-galactosidase, and beta-galactosidase: positive, negative, positive, and positive, respectively, for the former species and negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively, for the latter species. The type strain of C. aldenense is RMA 9741 (ATCC BAA-1318; CCUG 52204), and the type strain of C. citroniae is RMA 16102 (ATCC BAA-1317; CCUG 52203).
TI  - Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
TI  - Occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). However, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to SDG conversion. Therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of SDG metabolising bacteria. The data showed differences in conversion efficiency between SDG deglycosylating species, but SDG was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. The strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db showed the highest initial rate of SDG deglycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides distasonis and B. fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. However, Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only two out of 20 faecal samples. Bacteria involved in the demethylation step of SDG conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than SDG. In particular, Peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. Finally, Eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae P240.
AB  - We found the occurrence of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in Enterobacter cloacae P240, isolated from soils under anaerobic conditions, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified enzyme was a homohexamer of identical 60 kDa subunits. The purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. Its Km value for 4-hydroxybenzoate was 596 microM. The enzyme also catalyzed decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, for which the Km value was 6.80 mM. In the presence of 3 M KHCO3 and 20 mM phenol, the decarboxylase catalyzed the reverse carboxylation reaction of phenol to form 4-hydroxybenzoate with a molar conversion yield of 19%. The Km value for phenol was calculated to be 14.8 mM. The gene encoding the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase was isolated from E. cloacae P240. Nucleotide sequencing of recombinant plasmids revealed that the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase gene codes for a 475-amino-acid protein. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme is similar to those of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum (53% identity), VdcC protein (vanillate decarboxylase) of Streptomyces sp. strain D7 (72%) and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Escherichia coli (28%). The hypothetical proteins, showing 96-97% identities to the primary structure of E. cloacae P240 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, were found in several bacterial strains.
TI  - Allobaculum stercoricanis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from canine feces.
AB  - Morphological, biochemical, and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown anaerobic, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from dog feces. The unknown bacterium was tentatively identified as a Eubacterium species, based on cellular morphological and biochemical tests. 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies, however, revealed that it was phylogenetically distant from Eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus Eubacterium. Phylogenetically, the unknown species forms a hitherto unknown sub-line proximal to the base of a cluster of organisms (designated rRNA cluster XVI), which includes Clostridium innocuum, Streptococcus pleomorphus, and some Eubacterium species. Based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as a new genus and species, Allobaculum stercoricanis. Using a specific rRNA-targeted probe designed to identify Allobaculum stercoricanis, in situ hybridisation showed this novel species represents a significant organism in canine feces comprising between 0.1% and 3.7% of total cells stained with DAPI (21 dog fecal samples). The type strain of Allobaculum stercoricanis is DSM 13633(T)=CCUG 45212(T).
TI  - Subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  - During studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium leptum supra-generic rRNA cluster and displays a close affinity to some rDNA clones derived from human and pig feces. The nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with Anaerofilum agile and A. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, Subdoligranulum variabile. The type strain of S. variabile is BI 114(T) (=CCUG 47106(T)=DSM 15176(T)).
TI  - Clostridium tunisiense sp. nov., a new proteolytic, sulfur-reducing bacterium isolated from an olive mill wastewater contaminated by phosphogypse.
AB  - A new sporulated fermentative bacterium designated strain E1(T) (T=type strain),  was isolated from an anaerobic mud of an olive mill wastewater basin contaminated by phosphogypse produced by a Tunisian factory. Strain E1(T) was a motile Gram-positive slightly curved rod with spherical terminal spore swelling the cell. It grew between 18 degrees C and 43 degrees C with an optimum at 37 degrees C and pH 7.8 (range 5.5-8.7), without NaCl (range 0-3%). Strain E1(T) was a chemoorganotrophic anaerobic bacterium fermenting only proteins and amino acids. Yeast extract was required for growth. Elemental sulfur was used as terminal electron acceptor. The G+C content of the DNA was 32.6 mol%. The closest phylogenetical relatives of strain E1(T) were Clostridium thiosulfatireducens and C. subterminale (97.3% similarity for partial rRNA gene sequences). DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain E1(T) and both species were 17% and 20.8%, respectively. On the basis of differences in genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain E1(T) (DSM 15206(T), CIP 107666(T)) is proposed as the type strain of a new species, C. tunisiense sp. nov. GenBank accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain E1(T) is AY187622.
TI  - Clostridium bartlettii sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Seven obligately anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms isolated from human faecal specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Strains of the unidentified bacterium used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid, isovaleric acid and phenylacetic acid (PAA) as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a G +C content of approximately 29.8 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the 7 strains were genetically highly related to each other (displaying >99.5% sequence similarity) and represent a previously unknown sub-line within the Clostridium Cluster XI. The closest described species to the novel bacterium is Clostridium glycolicum, although a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of 4% demonstrates that they represent different species. Genomic DNA-DNA pairing studies confirmed the separateness of the unknown species and C. glycolicum (30.6% similarity between the proposed type strain of the novel species, WAL 16138, and C. glycolicum ATCC 14880(T)). Based on morphologic, phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is therefore proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as C. bartlettii sp. nov. The type strain of C. bartlettii is WAL 16138(T) (= ATCCBAA-827(T)=CCUG48940(T)).
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile isolated from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea. In this study, 181 stool samples from children with and without acute diarrhea were analysed. Eighteen children with acute diarrhea were positive to C. ramosum, C. difficile, C. limosum, C. clostridioforme, C. septicum, C. butyricum, C. innocuum and Clostridium sp. Nineteen children without diarrhea harbored C. ramosum, C. septicum, C. barattii, C. butyricum, C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. bifermentans, C. clostridioforme and C. paraputrificum. No patient with diarrhea harbored C. barattii, C. bifermentans, C. paraputrificum and C. sphenoides. In addition, ten C. difficile strains were detected in 5 (5.5%) of the children with diarrhea. Also, no children from control group harbored C. difficile, C. limosum and Clostridium sp. Most of the tested strains were resistant to all the used antimicrobial. Nine C. difficile were toxigenic on VERO cells and by multiplex PCR, six strains showed both toxin A and B genes and three strains showed only toxin B gene. In this study, the presence of C. difficile was not significant, and it is suggested the need of more studies to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile play in the childhood diarrhea and these organisms must be looked for routinely and a periodic evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility should be performed.
TI  - Anaerofustis stercorihominis gen. nov., sp. nov., from human feces.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on an unidentified Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from human feces. The organism was catalase-negative, resistant to 20% bile, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a G+C content of approximately 70 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the unidentified bacterium was a member of the Clostridium sub-phylum of the Gram-positive bacteria, and formed a loose association with rRNA cluster XV. Sequence divergence values of 12% or greater were observed between the unidentified bacterium and all other recognized species within this and related rRNA clusters. Treeing analysis showed the unknown anaerobe formed a deep line branching near to the base of rRNA cluster XV and phylogenetically represents a hitherto unknown taxon, distinct from Acetobacterium, Eubacterium sensu stricto, Pseudoramibacter and other related organisms. Based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium from feces be classified in a new genus Anaerofustis, as Anaerofustis stercorihominis sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerofustis stercorihominis is ATCC BAA-858(T)=CCUG 47767(T).
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new Clostridium sp. that performs effective cellulosic waste digestion in a thermophilic methanogenic bioreactor.
AB  - A methanogenic bioreactor that utilized wastepaper was developed and operated at  55 degrees C. Microbial community structure analysis showed the presence of a group of clostridia that specifically occurred during the period of high fermentation efficiency. To isolate the effective cellulose digester, the sludge that exhibited high fermentation efficiency was inoculated into a synthetic medium that contained cellulose powder as the sole carbon source and was successively cultivated. A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing study revealed that the enriched culture contained various clostridia that had diverse phylogenetic positions. The microorganisms were further enriched by successive cultivation with filter paper as the substrate, as well as the bait carrier. A resultant isolate, strain EBR45 (= Clostridium sp. strain NBRC101661), was a new member of the order Clostridiales phylogenetically and physiologically related to Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium straminisolvens. Specific PCR-based monitoring demonstrated that strain EBR45 specifically occurred during the high fermentation efficiency period in the original methanogenic sludge. Strain EBR45 effectively digested office paper in its pure cultivation system with a synthetic medium.
TI  - Pharmacological evidence for activation of phospholipid and small GTP binding protein signalling cascades by Nod factors.
AB  - The effects of lipo-chitin oligosaccharide Nod factors (NodNGR[S] from Rhizobium  sp. NGR234) on root hair deformation in Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. were studied using pharmacological agents to mimic and/or inhibit their action. It was hypothesised that the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton seen during Nod factor induced root hair deformation is modulated by protein kinase C, monomeric G proteins of the Rho superfamily and the location and amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (PI3Ps). This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. The protein kinase C activators, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (DPA) and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1, stimulated root hair deformation to a level similar to that seen with Nod factors or mastoparan, whereas the inhibitor Go 6976 inhibited root hair deformations induced by NodNGR[S], mastoparan, DPA and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1. The Ras antagonists mevastatin and sulindac sulphide, and the Rho antagonist exoenzyme C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum all inhibited Nod factor stimulated root hair deformation. Pasteurella multocida toxin activates Rho and stimulated root hair deformation, this stimulation was inhibited by both neomycin and exoenzyme C3 toxin. The PI3 kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY-294002 attenuated Nod factor induced root hair deformation. These studies were complemented with actin immunoprecipitations of root hair enriched microsomal membrane preparations from V. unguiculata which pulled down small GTP binding proteins. Root hair deformation is an important early stage in the formation of nitrogen fixing nodules and this study highlights that these processes may depend on signalling cascades involving phospholipids and small GTP binding proteins.
TI  - Ethanoligenens harbinense gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from molasses wastewater.
AB  - Two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains (YUAN-3T and X-29) were isolated from anaerobic activated sludge of molasses wastewater in a continuous stirred-tank reactor. The strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, mesophilic and motile. Cells were regular rods (0.4-0.8 x 1.5-8.0 microm) and occurred singly, in pairs and sometimes in chains of up to eight. Autoaggregative and autofluorescent growth of strain YUAN-3T and non-aggregative growth of strain X-29 were observed at 20-44 degrees C and pH 3.5-9.0. Both strains hydrolysed gelatin and aesculin and fermented several kinds of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. Fermentation end products formed from glucose were acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The predominant cellular fatty acids were the branched-chain fatty acids iso-C(16 : 0) (44.18 %) and iso-C(12 : 0) (26.67 %). The DNA G+C contents of strains YUAN-3T and X-29 were 47.8 and 49.0 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates represent a novel phyletic sublineage within the Clostridium cellulosi rRNA cluster, with <92 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to currently known species. On the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a new genus as a novel species, Ethanoligenens harbinense gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Ethanoligenens harbinense is YUAN-3T (=JCM 12961T = CGMCC 1.5033T).
TI  - Clostridium schirmacherense sp. nov., an obligately anaerobic, proteolytic, psychrophilic bacterium isolated from lake sediment of Schirmacher Oasis, Antarctica.
AB  - A novel obligately anaerobic, proteolytic bacterium, designated AP15T, was isolated from lake sediments of Schirmacher Oasis, Antarctica. The bacterium produced maximum cell mass between 5 and 10 degrees C in an anaerobic basal medium containing 0.5 % tryptone and peptone. The strain grew optimally at a pH around 8.0 and tolerated NaCl up to a concentration of 7.5 %. It contained diphosphatidylglycerol as the major phospholipid and C(15 : 0), C(16 : 0) and C(17 : 0) as the major cellular fatty acids. Several amino acids, including arginine, leucine, isoleucine, cysteine, glutamate and serine, supported growth. Glutamate was degraded to acetate, propionate, CO2 and H2. In addition, the strain degraded carbohydrates including glucose, raffinose, adonitol, ribose and rhamnose. The main fermentation products during growth on glucose were H2, CO2, formate, acetate, propionate and isovalerate. The DNA G+C content of the bacterium was 24 mol%. On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis, strain AP15(T) is identified as a close relative of Clostridium subterminale ATCC 25774T, with which it shares 99.5 % similarity at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level; however, it exhibits a low DNA-DNA binding value (55 %) to this strain at the whole-genome level. In addition to showing other major differences with respect to C. subterminale and other members of the genus Clostridium, AP15T also exhibits phenotypic differences. On the basis of these differences, strain AP15T is identified as representing a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium schirmacherense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AP15T (=DSM 17394T = JCM 13289T).
TI  - Clostridium ganghwense sp. nov., isolated from tidal flat sediment.
AB  - A Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, halophilic, motile, sporulating and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain HY-42-06T, was isolated from tidal flat sediment from Ganghwa Island in South Korea. The isolate produced glycerol, ethanol and CO2 as fermentation end-products from glucose. Strain HY-42-06T grew optimally at 35 degrees C, pH 7.5 and 3 % (w/v) artificial sea salts. No growth was observed in the absence of sea salts. In phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain HY-42-06T showed a distinct phyletic line within the members of cluster I of the order Clostridiales. The closest phylogenetic neighbour to strain HY-42-06T was Clostridium novyi ATCC 17861T (94.91 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Several phenotypic characters readily differentiate the tidal flat isolate from phylogenetically related clostridia. On the basis of polyphasic evidence, strain HY-42-06T should be classified as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Clostridium ganghwense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HY-42-06T (=IMSNU 40127T = KCTC 5146T = JCM 13193T).
TI  - Effect of nitrite on a thermophilic, methanogenic consortium from an oil storage  tank.
AB  - Samples from an oil storage tank (resident temperature 40 to 60 degrees C), which experienced unwanted periodic odorous gas emissions, contained up to 2,400/ml of thermophilic, lactate-utilizing, sulfate-reducing bacteria. Significant methane production was also evident. Enrichments on acetate gave sheathed filaments characteristic of the acetotrophic methanogen Methanosaeta thermophila of which the presence was confirmed by determining the PCR-amplified 16S rDNA sequence. 16S rDNA analysis of enrichments, grown on lactate- and sulfate-containing media, indicated the presence of bacteria related to Garciella nitratireducens, Clostridium sp. and Acinetobacter sp. These sulfidogenic enrichments typically produced sulfide to a maximum concentration of 5-7 mM in media containing excess lactate and 10 mM sulfate or thiosulfate. Both the production of sulfide and the consumption of acetate by the enrichment cultures were inhibited by low concentrations of nitrite (0.5-1.0 mM). Hence, addition of nitrite may be an effective way to prevent odorous gas emissions from the storage tank.
TI  - Trophic interaction of the aerotolerant anaerobe Clostridium intestinale and the  acetogen Sporomusa rhizae sp. nov. isolated from roots of the black needlerush Juncus roemerianus.
AB  - Acetogens were enumerated from root homogenates of the black needlerush Juncus roemerianus obtained from a nearly pristine salt marsh. An isolated colony, ST1, yielded acetogenic activity and was initially thought to be a pure culture; however, ST1 was subsequently found to be composed of an aerotolerant fermentative anaerobe (RC) and an acetogen (RS(T)) ((T) indicates type strain). The two spore-forming mesophiles were separated by selective cultivation under conditions favouring the growth of either RC or RS(T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of RC was 99 % similar to that of Clostridium intestinale, indicating that RC was a new isolate of this clostridial species. The rRNA gene sequence most similar to that of RS(T) was only 96 % similar to that of RS(T) and was from a species of the acetogenic genus Sporomusa, indicating that RS(T) was a new sporomusal species; the name Sporomusa rhizae sp. nov. is proposed. RC grew at the expense of saccharides. H(2)-forming butyrate fermentation was the primary catabolism utilized by RC under anoxic conditions, while homolactate fermentation was the primary catabolism under oxic conditions. RC consumed O(2) and tolerated 20 % O(2) in the headspace of shaken broth cultures. In contrast, RS(T) was acetogenic, utilized H(2), lactate and formate, did not utilize saccharides, and could not tolerate high concentrations of O(2). RS(T) grew by trophic interaction with RC on saccharides via the uptake of H(2), and, to a lesser extent, lactate and formate produced by RC. Co-cultures of the two organisms yielded high amounts of acetate. These results indicate that (i) previously uncharacterized species of Sporomusa are associated with Juncus roots and (ii) trophic links to O(2)-consuming aerotolerant anaerobes might contribute to the in situ activities and survival strategies of acetogens in salt marsh rhizospheres, a habitat subject to gradients of plant-derived O(2).
TI  - Clostridium lundense sp. nov., a novel anaerobic lipolytic bacterium isolated from bovine rumen.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, endospore-forming, lipolytic bacterium, designated strain R1T, was isolated from bovine rumen fluid and characterized. Cells of this isolate were Gram-positive, non-motile rods that formed spherical terminal spores. The overall biochemical and physiological characteristics indicated that this strain should be placed in the genus Clostridium. The strain grew at temperatures between 25 and 47 degrees C (optimum, 37 degrees C), at pH between 5.0 and 8.5 (optimum pH 5.5-7.0) and in NaCl concentrations of 0-3% (w/v). The isolate was not able to utilize glucose or other carbohydrates as carbon sources. The DNA G + C content was 31.2 mol%. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of R1T revealed that it has the closest match (98 % similarity) with Clostridium tetanomorphum DSM 4474T. The highest levels of DNA-DNA relatedness of the isolate were 61.9 and 54.3% with Clostridium pascui DSM 10365T and C. tetanomorphum DSM 4474T, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, phylogenetic analysis, DNA G + C content, DNA-DNA hybridization data and distinct phenotypic characteristics, strain R1T (= DSM 17049T = CCUG 50446T) was classified in the genus Clostridium, as a member of a novel species, for which the name Clostridium lundense sp. nov. is proposed.
TI  - Aqueous two-phase systems extraction of alpha-toxin from Clostridium perfringens  type A.
AB  - Two sequential half-fraction designs were applied to studying the alpha-toxin partition produced by Clostridium perfringens type A in aqueous two phase systems (ATPS), as a function of four factors: PEG molar mass and concentration, phosphate concentration and pH. The highest purification factor, yield and partition coefficient results were obtained with PEG 8000 (15%, w/w), phosphate at 20% (w/w) and pH 8.0. This system allows, in a single step, an alpha-toxin purification of 4.6-fold with final activity yield of 230% and partition coefficient of 113.9 in the PEG rich phase.
TI  - Effect of gamma-irradiation on the occurrence of pathogenic microorganisms and nutritive value of four principal cereal grains.
AB  - The effects of (60)Co gamma-photon-irradiation on the natural occurrence of pathogenic microorganisms in four principal cereal grains and on amino acids and vitamins in these cereals were investigated. The total numbers of aerobic bacteria were reduced by three logarithmic decades when grains were given a dose of 10kGy. Coliforms and "coagulase- positive" staphylococci were inhibited by a dose of 1kGy, whereas fungi were inhibited by a dose of 5kGy. The 15kGy dose eliminated viable microorganisms in cereal grains, and about 10-30 colony-forming units of Clostridium sp. per gram of grain survived after this dose. The dose of 10kGy did not cause any measurable destruction of total amino acids. Thiamin was reduced by 22-33% and riboflavin by 10-16% after a dose of 10kGy. Irradiation did not increase the acid values significantly, but did increase the peroxide values, which was not accompanied by the off-odors of cereals. We conclude that the overall dose of 10kGy is very effective for microbial decontamination of cereal grains, and does not adversely affect the nutritional quality of cereal grains.
TI  - Effect of iron(III), humic acids and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate on biodegradation of cyclic nitramines by Clostridium sp. EDB2.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the biodegradation of cyclic nitramines by an anaerobic marine bacterium, Clostridium sp. EDB2, in the presence of Fe(III), humic acids (HA) and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). METHODS AND RESULTS: An obligate anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium sp. EDB2, degraded RDX and HMX, and produced similar product distribution including nitrite, methylenedinitramine, nitrous oxide, ammonium, formaldehyde, formic acid and carbon dioxide. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mass balance for RDX products were 87% and 82%, respectively, and for HMX were 88% and 74%, respectively. Bacterial growth and biodegradation of RDX and HMX were stimulated in the presence of Fe(III), HA and AQDS suggesting that strain EDB2 utilized Fe(III), HA and AQDS as redox mediators to transfer electrons to cyclic nitramines. CONCLUSIONS: Strain EDB2 demonstrated a multidimensional approach to degrade RDX and HMX: first, direct degradation of the chemicals; second, indirect degradation by reducing Fe(III) to produce reactive-Fe(II); third, indirect degradation by reducing HA and AQDS which act as electron shuttles to transfer electrons to the cyclic nitramines. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study could be helpful in determining the fate of cyclic nitramine energetic chemicals in the environments rich in Fe(III) and HA.
TI  - Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of neurotoxin gene from an environmental isolate of Clostridium sp.: comparison with other clostridial neurotoxins.
AB  - A Clostridium sp. isolated from intestine of decaying fish exhibited 99% sequence identity with C. tetani at 16S rRNA level. It produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized by botulinum antitoxin (A+B+E) as well as tetanus antitoxin. The gene fragments for light chain, C-terminal and N-terminal regions of the heavy chain of the toxin were amplified using three reported primer sets for tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). The neurotoxin gene fragments were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The sequences obtained exhibited approximately 98, 99 and 98% sequence identity with reported gene sequences of TeNT/LC, TeNT/HC and TeNT/HN, respectively. The phylogenetic interrelationship between the neurotoxin gene of Clostridium sp. with previously reported gene sequences of Clostridium botulinum A to G and C. tetani was examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences. Six amino acids were substituted at four different positions in the light chain of neurotoxin from the isolate when compared with the reported closest sequence of TeNT. Of these, four were located in the beta15 motif at a solvent inaccessible, buried region of the protein molecule. One of these substitutions were on the solvent accessible surface residue of alpha1 motif, previously shown to have strong sequence conservation. A substitution of two amino acids observed in N-terminal region of heavy chain were buried residues, located in the beta21 and beta37 motifs showing variability in other related sequences. The C-terminal region responsible for binding to receptor was conserved, showing no changes in the amino acid sequence.
TI  - Phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) to the enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). However, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. Therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of SDG. Strains of Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db, deglycosylated SDG. Demethylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium callanderi, Eubacterium limosum and Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Clostridium scindens and Eggerthella lenta. Finally, the newly isolated strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ED to EL. The results indicate that the activation of SDG involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Ulcerative enteritis (quail disease) in lories.
AB  - Ulcerative enteritis is found in a wide range of avian hosts but has not been described in psittacine birds. This case report describes ulcerative enteritis in four lories (two Trichoglossus sp. and two Eos sp.) that were found dead without any previous sign of disease. Macroscopically, all four birds showed good body condition. The only remarkable finding was a moderate dilatation of the small intestine with the presence of multiple yellow foci. Histologically, multiple ulcers extended into the submucosa and were filled with necrotic debris; bacteria and fibrin were observed in the intestinal mucosa. The liver and spleen exhibited a multifocal fibrinoid necrosis associated with a very moderate inflammatory reaction. Microbiological isolation revealed colonies of Clostridium colinum and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of the investigated birds.
TI  - Small GTP-binding protein RhoB is expressed in glial Muller cells in the vertebrate retina.
AB  - Among several small Rho GTPases observed in the chick retina, RhoB was transiently expressed during development and mainly present in glial Muller cells in the adult. The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of RhoB in the chick and mouse adult retinas and to study its potential role in the maintenance of cell morphology. The distribution of RhoB was studied in situ and pure Muller cell cultures were submitted to Clostridium difficile toxin A and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) treatment in order to inactivate and activate Rho proteins, respectively. Cell morphology, F-actin arrangement, RhoB, and vimentin distribution were studied by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The results showed that, in both species, all vimentin-containing cells also expressed RhoB in situ and in vitro. Toxin A promoted cell rounding and detachment due to actin depolymerization, changing the distribution of RhoB only in chick cells. In serum-starved cells LPA stimulated actin polymerization and cell spreading, but only in chick cells was RhoB distribution recruited to expanding cellular processes and newly formed focal adhesions. These data suggest that, although RhoB is expressed by Muller cells in chick and mouse, its role in the maintenance of cellular morphology and regulation may be different. In addition, we show that RhoB may be an interesting Muller cell marker in the adult retina.
TI  - [Bacterial 16S rDNA sequence analysis of Siberian tiger faecal flora].
AB  - Bacterial 16S rDNA library of Siberian tiger was developed and 15 different clones were obtained using EcoR I and Hind III in restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. DNA sequencing and similarity analysis showed that 10 clones matched corresponding Clostridium sequences, of which 6 sequences had over 99% similarity with Clostridium novyi type A, and 4 sequences had 97% similarity with Swine manure bacterium RT-18B, which identified as Peptostreptococcus spp. The other five 16S rDNA sequences had 94% - 95% similarity with Clostridium pascui, Clostridium tetani E88, Clostridium sp. 14505 Clostridium perfringens and Carnobacterium sp.

TI  - Clostridium asparagiforme sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  - An obligatory anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped organism was isolated from faeces of a healthy human donor. It was characterized using biochemical, phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. The organism produced acetate, lactate, and ethanol as the major products of glucose fermentation. The G + C content was 53 mol%. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the unidentified bacterium is a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive bacteria, and most closely related to species of the Clostridium coccoides cluster (rRNA cluster XIVa) [M.D. Collins et al., The phylogeny of the genus Clostridium: proposal of five new genera and eleven new species combinations, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44 (1994) 812-826]. Clostridium bolteae and Clostridium clostridioforme were identified as the most closely related described species. A 16S rRNA sequence divergence value of > 3% suggested that the isolate represents a new species. This was also supported by the gyrase-encoding gyrB gene sequences. Based on these findings, we propose the novel bacterium from human faeces to be classified as a new species, Clostridium asparagiforme. The type strain of C. asparagiforme is N6 (DSM 15981 and CCUG 48471).
TI  - [Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov., an obligately alkaliphilic cellulolytic bacterium from a soda lake in the Baikal region].
AB  - The first anaerobic alkaliphilic cellulolytic microorganism has been isolated from the Verkhnee Beloe soda lake (Buryatiya, Russia) with pH 10.2 and a salt content of up to 24 g/l. Five strains were characterized. Strain Z-7026 was chosen as the type strain. The cells of the isolate are gram-positive spore-forming rods. A mucous external capsule is produced. The microorganism is obligately alkaliphilic, growing in a pH range of 8.0-10.2, with an optimum at pH 9.0. Sodium ions and, in carbonate-buffered media, sodium chloride are obligately required. The microorganism is slightly halophilic; it grows at 0.017-0.4 M Na+ with an optimum at 0.15-0.3 M Na+. The metabolism is fermentative and strictly anaerobic. Cellulose, cellobiose, and xylan can be used as growth substrates. Plant and algal debris can be fermented. Lactate, ethanol, acetate, hydrogen, and traces of formate are produced during cellulose or cellobiose fermentation. Yeast extract or vitamins are required for anabolic purposes. The microorganism fixes dinitrogen and is nitrogenase-positive. It is tolerant to up to 48 mM Na2S. Growth is not inhibited by kanamycin or neomycin. Chloramphenicol, streptomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, ampiox, bacillin, novobiocin, and bacitracin suppress growth. The DNA G+C content is 29.9 mol %. According to the nucleotide sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, strain Z-7026 is phylogenetically close to the neutrophilic cellulolytic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum (95.5%), C. aldrichii (94.9%), and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus (94.8%). It is proposed as a new species: Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of TCE-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  - Two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate TCE to ethene. Each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate TCE to ethene through several serial transfers. Microbial community analyses based upon 16S rDNA, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination. Results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including Dehalococcoides sp., low G+C Gram-positives (mostly Clostridium and Eubacterium sp.), Bacteroides sp., Citrobacter sp., and delta Proteobacteria (mostly Desulfovibrio sp.). Phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium. Inconsistent detection of Dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and T-RFLP of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Q-PCR with primers specific to Dehalococcoides 16S rDNA resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. Our results suggest that TCE-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of Dehalococcoides cells detected with Dehalococcoides specific 16S rDNA primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.
TI  - Commensal microbiota alter the abundance and TCR responsiveness of splenic naive  CD4+ T lymphocytes.
AB  - The epidemiologic risk of certain systemic immunologic diseases is affected by commensal or environmental microbiota, but the cellular basis of the "hygiene hypothesis" is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that composition of the commensal microbiota affects the functional state of the peripheral naive (CD62L(hi)CD44(lo)) T lymphocyte populations. Restricted flora (RF) mice (stably colonized with excess nonpathogenic Clostridium sp., and changes in other bacterial and fungal taxa) were distinguished after the neonatal period by a progressive deficiency in absolute numbers of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. SPF and RF mice had comparable levels of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This phenotype was attributable to the altered levels of certain commensals and their products, since germ-free mice had normal absolute numbers of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their respective naive and memory subsets. The naive CD4+ T cell subset was functionally distinguished in RF mice versus SPF mice by TCR hyperresponsiveness, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and increased activation-induced cell death. Biochemically, these traits were associated with higher basal phosphorylation of the TCR signaling proteins ZAP-70, Lck, and LAT. These findings indicate that enteric microbial products, through unknown cellular circuitry, influence steps in CD4 T cell differentiation moderating basal TCR signaling and immune responsiveness.
TI  - Two proteins, Mn2+, and low molecular cofactor are required for C-glucosyl-cleavage of mangiferin.
AB  - C-Glucosides, in which sugars are attached to the aglycone by carbon-carbon bonds, are generally resistant to acid and enzyme hydrolysis. The C-glucosyl bond of mangiferin, a xanthone C-glucoside, was cleaved by anaerobic incubation with a human intestinal bacterium, Bacteroides sp. MANG, to give norathyriol. A cell-free extract obtained by sonication of B. sp. MANG demonstrated cleaving activity for mangiferin to norathyriol by adding NADH, diaphorase, and dithiothreitol. Both high molecular weight (>10 k) and low molecular weight (<10 k) fractions obtained from the cell-free extract were required for the activity. MnCl2 was necessary for the activity, but other metal ions were not. By purification of the high molecular weight fraction using DEAE-cellulose and Phenyl Sepharose column chromatography, two fractions, designated as proteins A and B, were separated and required for the activity. Neither protein A nor protein B alone showed any activity. This is the first report describing a C-glucosyl-cleaving enzyme from human intestinal bacterium that seems to involve a novel enzyme mechanism.
TI  - Stable coexistence of five bacterial strains as a cellulose-degrading community.
AB  - A cellulose-degrading defined mixed culture (designated SF356) consisting of five bacterial strains (Clostridium straminisolvens CSK1, Clostridium sp. strain FG4, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. strain M1-3, Brevibacillus sp. strain M1-5, and Bordetella sp. strain M1-6) exhibited both functional and structural stability; namely, no change in cellulose-degrading efficiency was observed, and all members stably coexisted through 20 subcultures. In order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the observed stability, "knockout communities" in which one of the members was eliminated from SF356 were constructed. The dynamics of the community structure and the cellulose degradation profiles of these mixed cultures were determined in order to evaluate the roles played by each eliminated member in situ and its impact on the other members of the community. Integration of each result gave the following estimates of the bacterial relationships. Synergistic relationships between an anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium (C. straminisolvens CSK1) and two strains of aerobic bacteria (Pseudoxanthomonas sp. strain M1-3 and Brevibacillus sp. strain M1-5) were observed; the aerobes introduced anaerobic conditions, and C. straminisolvens CSK1 supplied metabolites (acetate and glucose). In addition, there were negative relationships, such as the inhibition of cellulose degradation by producing excess amounts of acetic acid by Clostridium sp. strain FG4, and growth suppression of Bordetella sp. strain M1-6 by Brevibacillus sp. strain M1-5. The balance of the various types of relationships (both positive and negative) is thus considered to be essential for the stable coexistence of the members of this mixed culture.
TI  - Sublumbar abscess and diskospondylitis in a cat.
AB  - Diskospondylitis is uncommon in cats. We describe a cat with diskospondylitis of  the L7-S1 intervertebral disk, and a concurrent sublumbar abscess. Radiographic, computed tomographic and ultrasonographic findings are presented. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of blood and spinal fluid yielded no growth. Aerobic and anaerobic urine cultures resulted in growth of an Enterococcus sp. and Clostridium perfringens, respectively. The cat was successfully treated with enrofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical signs resolved completely, and based on follow-up ultrasonography there was no remaining evidence of the sublumbar abscess. Etiologic agents and outcome from other cats with diskospondylitis are reviewed.
TI  - Arsenate respiratory reductase gene (arrA) for Desulfosporosinus sp. strain Y5.
AB  - Desulfosporosinus sp. strain Y5 is a spore-forming bacterium capable of dissimilatory arsenate reduction coupled to the oxidation of aromatic compounds. In arsenate respiration, the arsenate respiratory reductase (ARR) catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. Our objective is to characterize the arrA gene, encoding the ARR, for Desulfosporosinus sp. strain Y5. Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the few arrA gene sequences available at the time and validated against positive and negative controls. The resulting arrA-amplicon of approximately 2.0kb was cloned and sequenced. The arrA from Desulfosporosinus sp. Y5 is closely related to Desulfitobacterium hafniense (similarity of 77% and 81% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively). Phylogenetic topology based on the arrA gene was partially congruent with that of 16S rRNA-based analysis. This arrA sequence will support the development of specific tracking probes for Desulfosporosinus sp. Y5 and the molecular characterization and monitoring of dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria.
TI  - Effects of difructose anhydride III (DFA III) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  - The effects of difructose anhydride III (di-D-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; DFA III) administration (3% DFA III for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). According to DGGE profiles, the number of bacteria related to Bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the Clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides uniformis and Ruminococcus productus increased in DFA III-fed rat cecum. In the cecal contents of DFA III-fed rats, a lowering of pH and an increase in short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially acetic acid, were observed. The DFA III-assimilating bacterium, Ruminococcus sp. M-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of DFA III-fed rats. The strain had 98% similarity with R. productus ATCC 27340T (L76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. These results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by DFA III administration. Moreover, DFA III stimulated the growth of Ruminococcus sp. M-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. It is expected that DFA III would be a new candidate as a prebiotic.
TI  - Anaerobic degradation of cis-1,2-dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride by Clostridium sp. strain DC1 isolated from landfill leachate sediment.
AB  - The bacterial community structure of anaerobic enrichment cultures that are capable of degrading both cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) and isolation of the organism responsible for the degradation were investigated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of a PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene from the cultures showed the possible predominance of Clostridium species. One isolate, designated strain DC1, was closely related to members of Clostridiaceae, based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, and the highest sequence similarity (98.9%) was obtained for Clostridium saccarobutylicum. In culture experiments, strain DC1 was shown to degrade cis-DCE and VC during the stationary phase of growth without accumulation of VC and/or ethene. The bacterial growth was not linked to the degradation of cis-DCE and VC. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that two moles of chloride ions as released from one mole of cis-DCE during the incubation period, indicating that cis-DCE was fully dechlorinated. The results appear consistent with the presence of a mechanism of oxidative dechlorination rather than respiratory reductive dechlorination; the latter is accompanied by transient formation of dechlorinated ethenes from cis-DCE and VC.
TI  - Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of microbial community from field-scale composter.
AB  - The diversity of microbial community during the decomposition of waste in a field-scale composter (Hazaka system) was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The composter operates at a high temperature through a self-heating system, creating a thermophilic (60-76 degrees C) stage during the initial phase and a mesophilic (45 degrees C) stage towards the later phase of the composting period. The pH of the system (pH 7.75-8.10) did not vary significantly during the process while moisture content was reduced from 48.8% to 25.1%. DGGE and 16S rDNA analyses showed that the following genera were found throughout the process: Propionibacterium sp., Methylobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Bradyrhizobium sp. Different Bacillus spp. thrive at the thermophilic or the mesophilic stage while Clostridium sp. was only found at the initial phase of the process. Staphylococcus sp. and Caulobacter sp. or Brevundimonas sp. existed during the later phase of the composting period.
TI  - Microbial hydrogen production from sweet potato starch residue.
AB  - Clostridium butyricum could produce hydrogen from a sweet potato starch residue upon supplementation of nitrogen sources. A repeated batch culture using a mixed culture of C. butyricum and Enterobacter aerogenes produced hydrogen with a yield of 2.4 mol H2/mol glucose under a controlled culture pH of 5.25 in a medium consisting of the sweet potato starch residue and 0.1% Polypepton without addition of any reducing agents. Rhodobacter sp. M-19 produced hydrogen from the supernatant of the culture broth obtained in the repeated batch culture containing C. butyricum and E. aerogenes when 50 microg/l Na2MoO4.2H2O and 20 mg/l EDTA were added to the supernatant and it was cultured under a controlled culture pH of 7.5. A high yield of hydrogen of 7.0 mol H2/mol glucose from the starch remaining in the starch residue was attained in two-step repeated batch cultures containing C. butyricum and E. aerogenes, and by Rhodobacter sp. M-19.
TI  - Stereo-specificity for pro-(R) hydrogen of NAD(P)H during enzyme-catalyzed hydride transfer to CL-20.
AB  - A dehydrogenase from Clostridium sp. EDB2 and a diaphorase from Clostridium kluyveri were reacted with CL-20 to gain insights into the enzyme-catalyzed hydride transfer to CL-20, and the enzyme's stereo-specificity for either pro-R or pro-S hydrogens of NAD(P)H. Both enzymes biotransformed CL-20 at rates of 18.5 and 24nmol/h/mg protein, using NADH and NADPH as hydride-source, respectively, to produce a N-denitrohydrogenated product with a molecular weight of 393Da. In enzyme kinetics studies using reduced deuterated pyridine nucleotides, we found a kinetic deuterium isotopic effect of 2-fold on CL-20 biotransformation rate using dehydrogenase enzyme against (R)NADD as a hydride-source compared to either (S)NADD or NADH. Whereas, in case of diaphorase, the kinetic deuterium isotopic effect of about 1.5-fold was observed on CL-20 biotransformation rate using (R)NADPD as hydride-source. In a comparative study with LC-MS, using deuterated and non-deuterated NAD(P)H, we found a positive mass-shift of 1Da in the N-denitrohydrogenated product suggesting the involvement of a deuteride (D(-)) transfer from NAD(P)D. The present study thus revealed that both dehydrogenase and diaphorase enzymes from the two Clostridium species catalyzed a hydride transfer to CL-20 and showed stereo-specificity for pro-R hydrogen of NAD(P)H.
TI  - [Microbiologic evaluation of enteral diets handled in a hospital].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the microbiological quality of open enteral feeding system manipulated in a specialized hospital in oncology in the city of Natal-RN. METHODS: 20 samples of industrialized enteral feeding in open system had been analyzed. The searched microrganisms had been: Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, mesophilic aerobic bacteria and coagulase positive Staphylococci. The methodology used for accomplishment of the microbiological analyses was the praised one for the Food and Drug Administration--FDA. RESULTS: It was evidenced total coliforms, Escherichia coli and mesophilic aerobic bacteria contamination in 25%, 10% and 20% of the analyzed samples, respectively. It was not identified the presence of Bacillus cereus, Salmonella sp, Clostridium sulfite reducer, and coagulase positive Staphylococci in none of the analyzed samples. CONCLUSION: The gotten results show that the enteral feedings are in unsatisfactory hygienic-sanitary conditions, evidencing the necessity of a bigger control in the manipulation of the same ones.
TI  - Behavior of cellulose-degrading bacteria in thermophilic anaerobic digestion process.
AB  - Previously, we found that the newly isolated Clostridium sp. strain JC3 became the dominant cellulose-degrading bacterium in thermophilic methanogenic sludge. In the present study, the behavior of strain JC3 in the thermophilic anaerobic digestion process was investigated quantitatively by molecular biological techniques. A cellulose-degrading experiment was conducted at 55 degrees C with a 9.5 L of anaerobic baffled reactor having three compartments (Nos. 1, 2, 3). Over 80% of the COD input was converted into methane when 2.5 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1) was loaded for an HRT of 27 days. A FISH probe specific for strain JC3 was applied to sludge samples harvested from the baffled reactor. Consequently, the ratio of JC3 cells to DAPI-stained cells increased from below 0.5% (undetectable) to 9.4% (compartment 1), 13.1% (compartment 2) and 21.6% (compartment 3) at day 84 (2.5 kgCOD m(-3)d(-1)). The strain JC3 cell numbers determined by FISH correlated closely with the cellulose-degrading methanogenic activities of retained sludge. A specific primer set targeting the cellulase gene (cellobiohydrolaseA: cbhA) of strain JC3 was designed and applied to digested sludge for treating solid waste such as coffee grounds, wastepaper, garbage, cellulose and so on. The strain JC3 cell numbers determined by quantitative PCR correlated closely with the cellulose-sludge loading of the thermophilic digester. Strain JC3 is thus important in the anaerobic hydrolysis of cellulose in thermophilic anaerobic digestion processes.
TI  - Clostridium carboxidivorans sp. nov., a solvent-producing clostridium isolated from an agricultural settling lagoon, and reclassification of the acetogen Clostridium scatologenes strain SL1 as Clostridium drakei sp. nov.
AB  - A novel solvent-producing, anaerobic clostridium, strain P7(T), was isolated from sediment from an agricultural settling lagoon after enrichment with CO as the substrate. The metabolism of this Gram-positive, motile, spore-forming rod was primarily acetogenic. Acetate, ethanol, butyrate and butanol were the end-products of metabolism. Strain P7(T) grew on CO, H(2)/CO(2), glucose, galactose, fructose, xylose, mannose, cellobiose, trehalose, cellulose, starch, pectin, citrate, glycerol, ethanol, propanol, 2-propanol, butanol, glutamate, aspartate, alanine, histidine, asparagine, serine, betaine, choline and syringate as sole substrates. Growth was not supported by methanol, formate, D-arabinose, fucose, lactose, melibiose, amygdalin, gluconate, lactate, malate, arginine, glutamine or vanillate. Nitrate reduction, production of indole, gelatin hydrolysis and aesculin hydrolysis were not observed. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate showed that it was closely related to Clostridium scatologenes ATCC 25775(T) (99.7% sequence similarity) and clostridial strain SL1(T) (99.8% sequence similarity). Strain SL1 had been classified as a strain of C. scatologenes. However, DNA-DNA reassociation analysis showed that both strain P7(T) and strain SL1 represented novel clostridial species. It is proposed that strain P7(T) (=ATCC BAA-624(T)=DSM 15243(T)) be classified as the type strain of Clostridium carboxidivorans sp. nov. and that strain SL1(T) (=ATCC BAA-623(T)=DSM 12750(T)) be reclassified as the type strain of Clostridium drakei sp. nov.
TI  - Essential cysteine residues in Bacillus subtilis spore photoproduct lyase identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis.
AB  - Endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus and Clostridium spp.) are highly ultraviolet (UV) resistant and repair UV-induced DNA damage in part using the spore-specific DNA repair enzyme spore photoproduct (SP) lyase. SP lyase in all known sporeformers contains four conserved cysteine residues; three absolutely conserved residues are located at the "Radical SAM" consensus (C91xxxC95xxC98), which presumably participates in [4Fe-4S] cluster formation. A fourth conserved cysteine, the function of which is unknown, is located at C141 in SP lyase from all Bacillus spp. sequenced to date. To probe the function of the fourth cysteine, each conserved cysteine in the B. subtilis SP lyase was systematically altered to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. UV-visible spectroscopy of wild-type and mutant SP lyases indicated that C141 does not participate in [4Fe-4S] formation and redox chemistry; however, in vivo SP lyase activity was abolished in all mutants, indicating an essential role for C141 in SP lyase activity.
TI  - [Emphysematous cystitis due to Clostridium perfringens--a localised infection in  a man with generalized melanoma].
AB  - Emphysematous cystitis was found at autopsy of a 47-year-old man suffering from generalised malignant melanoma. Bacteriological cultures from the urinary bladder showed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Clostridium perfringens type A, toxic strain. The histological examination revealed cystic dilatation of lymphatic vessels both in bladder mucosa and muscularis propria. There were multinucleated macrophages in the lining of some of these cystic spaces and a few Gram-positive rods inside their lumina. In the mucosal and submucosal connective tissue there were signs of chronic inflammation and, focally, small haemorrhages. We suppose that the gas production was due to the presence of Clostridium perfringens and believe that the infection of the urinary bladder occurred in relation to the repeated insertion of the catheter into the bladder of a patient with secondary immunosuppression. Emphysematous cystitis was, in our case, a localised clostridial infection without clinical and morphological signs of generalised septicaemia.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - A novel thermoacidophilic endoglucanase, Ba-EGA, from a new cellulose-degrading bacterium, Bacillus sp.AC-1.
AB  - A newly discovered bacterium, strain AC1, containing cellulase was isolated from  the gastric juice of the mollusca, Ampullaria crosseans. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence and carbon sources revealed that the bacterium belonged to the genus Bacillus. A novel endoglucanase (Ba-EGA) was purified from culture supernatants of the bacterium growing in CMC-Na (low viscosity) induction medium. The cellulase was purified about 150-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange, hydrophobic, and gel filtration chromatography, with a specific activity of 35.0 IU/mg. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 67 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed a sequence of SDYNYVEVLQKSILF, which had high homology with endoglucanases from the Bacillus and Clostridium species. The maximal activity of the enzyme with the substrate of CM-cellulose is at pH 4.5-6.5 and 70 degrees C, respectively. The studies on pH and temperature stability showed that the Ba-EGA is stable enough between pH 7.5 and 10.5 at 30 degrees C for 2 h, and more than 80% of the activity still remains when incubation was prolonged to 1 h at 50 degrees C. The activity of the enzyme was significantly inhibited by Fe(2+), Cu(2+) (5.0 mM of each), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (0.5%) and obviously activated by Tween 20 and Triton X-100 (0.25% each). Binding studies revealed that the Ba-EGA had cellulose-binding domain.
TI  - [Isolation and characterization of new species hydrogen producing bacterium Ethanologenbacterium sp. strain X-1 and its capability of hydrogen production].
AB  - To obtain hydrogen-producing bacterium of high efficiency, a strain X-1 of hydrogen-producing bacteria was isolated from the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) by anaerobic Hungate technique. The Comparative sequence analysis of 16S rDNA showed that homology of strain X-1 with Clostridium cellulose and Acetanaerobacterium elongatum is less than 94%. All sequence alignment of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR) indicated displayed that consensus region is tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Ile), variable region is not homologous. Morphological, physic-biochemical character, and comparative sequence analysis of 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA ISR indicated that strain X-1 belong to new genus named Ethanologenbacterium gen. nov.. Strain X-1 is facultative anaerobe bacillus; its main fermentative products are acetic acid, ethanol, H2 and CO2. The metabolic character of strain X-1 is typical ethanol type fermentation. Its capability of hydrogen production was measured in the batch culture experiment. X-1's maximum specific hydrogen producing rate is 28.3 mmol H2/( g dry cell x h) at pH 4.0 and 36 degrees C. Result of identify and analysis of hydrogen production ability demonstrated strain X-1 belong to new genus of high hydrogen-producing bacteria.
TI  - Decrease of enteric micro-organisms from rural sewage sludge during their composting in straw mixture.
AB  - AIMS: To study the decrease of enteric micro-organisms including viable nematode  eggs, enteroviruses, faecal indicators (Escherichia coli and enterococci) and pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella sp. and Clostridium perfringens) of a rural sewage sludge when it is composted for 7 months in mixture with straw. METHODS AND RESULTS: Numbers of the test organisms and the physico-chemical parameters were measured on a monthly basis on the mixture, on the compost after being turned, and on the pile in three positions representing the part by which air is incoming, the bottom of the pile and the part through which air is outgoing. The lowest temperature in the pile was observed at the bottom, where it did not exceed 50 degrees C against 66 degrees C in the two other areas. There were no significant differences between the three areas in terms of micro-organism survival. Infectious enteroviruses were inactivated rapidly and were not found after the first turning whereas some genomes were detected until after the third turning. Escherichia coli and enterococci presented a similar survival rate and their number decreased by 4 log(10) whereas Salmonella decayed at a greater rate than L. monocytogenes. The numbers of C. perfringens decreased gradually to reach a final concentration in the mature compost of about 10(2) CFU g(-1) dry matter (d.m.), which was similar to that of the faecal indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The hygienic effect of sludge composting in mixture with straw results in a significant reduction of enteric micro-organisms, the concentration of the faecal indicators in the final product being < 64 most probable number g(-1) d.m. The concentrations of Salmonella, enteroviruses and viable nematode eggs in the final product were not detectable which is in accordance with the French legislation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results which pointed out the different behaviour of the test micro-organisms reflect the difficulty to propose a relevant indicator of hygienization. Otherwise, they show that composting is an efficient means for hygienization of sludge of rural wastewater treatment, where the straw is available close to their place of production.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium sp. RKD producing botulinum-like neurotoxin.
AB  - A Gram positive, motile, rod-shaped, strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from intestine of decaying fish was identified as Clostridium sp. RKD and produced a botulinum type B-like neurotoxin as suggested by mouse bioassay and protection with anti botulinum antibodies. The neurotoxicity was functionally characterized by the phrenic nerve hemi-diaphragm assay. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence, placed it at a different position from the reported strains of Clostridium botulinum. The strain exhibited differences from both Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani with respect to morphological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Botulinum group specific and serotype specific primers amplified the DNA fragments of 260 and 727 bp, respectively, indicating presence of botulinum type 'B' toxin gene. Sequence of nearly 700 bp amplified using primers specific for botulinum neurotoxin type B gene, did not show any significant match in the database when subjected to BLAST search.
TI  - Autohydrogenotrophic denitrifying microbial community in a glass beads biofilm reactor.
AB  - A glass bead biofilm reactor was operated using H2 as an electron donor to remove nitrate at 150 mg NO3-N l(-1) to below detection level. The microbial community in the glass beads biofilm reactor was investigated by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phylogenetic analysis. In DGGE analysis of the biofilm, five bands were dominant and indicated the presence of eight beta-proteobacteria, one gamma-proteobacteria and twelve clostridia. An unculturable Hydrogenophaga sp., which is a new genus of hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium was dominant in microbial community of the biofilm reactor.
TI  - Prevotella massiliensis sp. nov. isolated from human blood.
AB  - We report a bacterial isolate (Marseille isolate) recovered from the blood of a patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit, presenting with severe trauma, fever and mechanical ventilation. Colonies appeared at 37 degrees C on blood agar after 72 h incubation. This isolate was a strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative rod phenotypically related to other Prevotella species described to date: non-motile, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to kanamycin. Cells exhibited a trilamellar membrane under electron microscopy. The fatty acid methyl ester profile was marginally related to that of Clostridium botulinum group A (distance: 26.27%) and Bifidobacterium bifidum GC subgroup B (distance: 26.38%). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was 90.0% with that of Prevotella oris and 89.1% with that of Prevotella melaninogenica. Partial rpoB gene sequence similarity was 84.5 and 86.4% with P. oris and P. melaninogenica, respectively. According to current standards, phenotypic traits, 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequence analyses indicated that the Marseille isolate belonged to a previously unrecognized species of the genus Prevotella, and we propose classifying it in the new taxon "Prevotella massiliensis" sp. nov.
TI  - [Substrate specificity of collagenase of Streptomyces sp. 1349 and keratinase of  Streptomyces sp. 1382].
AB  - The paper determines the action specificity concerning the bonding type of collagenases of Strepomyces sp. 1349 and keratinases of Streptomyces sp. 1382. Experimental data obtained evidence for the wide specificity of the obtained enzymatic drugs. It has been established that both collagenases and keratinases display high specificity in respect of the bonds made by the residues of hydrophobic amino acids. Collagenases of Streptomyces sp. 1349, as to their wide action specificity, differed from collagenase of Clostridium histolyticum described in literature, that was confirmed by the results of double immunodiffusion in agar by Ouchterloni. Preparations of streptomycete collagenase obtained by the authors did not interact with serum obtained for highly purified collagenase of C. histolyticum of the firm "Merck". Investigation of the feather keratin lysates by the fractions of keratinases 1 and 2 have shown the difference in the content of amino acids released after hydrolysis that may be determined by different specificity of the enzymes action. Cysteine in the amount of 3.8% was also found in keratin lysate of the enzymatic fraction 1, that may evidence for the capacity of the fraction 1 to break the disulphide bonds in keratin molecule.
TI  - Clinical manifestations, treatment and control of infections caused by Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile should be suspected in patients who present with nosocomial diarrhoea. It is more common in the elderly or in patients with a debilitating underlying condition who have received antimicrobial agents, and up to 20-25% of patients may experience a relapse. The reference method for diagnosis is the cell culture cytotoxin test which detects the presence of toxin B in a cellular culture of human fibroblasts, but recovering C. difficile in culture allows the performance of a ''second-look" cell culture assay that enhances the potential for diagnosis. Oral metronidazole (500 mg tid or 250 mg every 6 hrs) and oral vancomycin (125 mg every 6 hrs) administered for 1014 days have similar therapeutic efficacy, with response rates near 90-97%. C. difficile strains resistant to metronidazole and with intermediate resistance to vancomycin have been described. The administration of probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus sp. or brewer's yeast for prophylaxis of CDAD remains controversial.
TI  - Monitoring of microbial community structure and succession in the biohydrogen production reactor by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
AB  - To study the structure of microbial communities in the biological hydrogen production reactor and determine the ecological function of hydrogen producing bacteria, anaerobic sludge was obtained from the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in different periods of time, and the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results of DGGE demonstrated that an obvious shift of microbial population happened from the beginning of star-up to the 28th day, and the ethanol type fermentation was established. After 28 days the structure of microbial community became stable, and the climax community was formed. Comparative analysis of 16S rDNA sequences from reamplifying and sequencing the prominent bands indicated that the dominant population belonged to low G+C Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium sp. and Ethanologenbacterium sp.), beta-proteobacteria (Acidovorax sp.), gamma-proteobacteria (Kluyvera sp.), Bacteroides (uncultured bacterium SJA-168), and Spirochaetes (uncultured eubacterium E1-K13), respectively. The hydrogen production rate increased obviously with the increase of Ethanologenbacterium sp., Clostridium sp. and uncultured Spirochaetes after 21 days, meanwhile the succession of ethanol type fermentation was formed. Throughout the succession the microbial diversity increased however it decreased after 21 days. Some types of Clostridium sp. Acidovorax sp., Kluyvera sp., and Bacteroides were dominant populations during all periods of time. These special populations were essential for the construction of climax community. Hydrogen production efficiency was dependent on both hydrogen producing bacteria and other populations. It implied that the co-metabolism of microbial community played a great role of biohydrogen production in the reactors.
TI  - Analysis of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice using PCR/DGGE.
AB  - AIM: To test combined polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR/DGGE) as an analytical method to investigate the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice during the development of colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The colonic microbiota of formerly germfree interleukin 10 (IL-10)-deficient mice that had been exposed to the faecal microbiota of specific pathogen-free animals was screened using PCR/DGGE. The composition of the large bowel microbiota of IL-10-deficient mice changed as colitis progressed. DNA fragments originating from four bacterial populations ('Bacteroides sp.', Bifidobacterium animalis, Clostridium cocleatum, enterococci) were more apparent in PCR/DGGE profiles of colitic mice relative to non-colitic animals, whereas two populations were less apparent (Eubacterium ventriosum, Acidophilus group lactobacilli). Specific DNA:RNA dot blot analysis showed that bifidobacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) abundance increased as colitis developed. CONCLUSIONS: PCR/DGGE was shown to be an effective method to demonstrate changes in the composition of the large bowel microbiota of mice in relation to progression of inflammatory disease. The intensity of staining of DNA fragments in DGGE profiles reflected increased abundance of bifidobacterial rRNA in the microbiota of colitic animals. As bifidobacterial fragments in PCR/DGGE profiles generated from microbiota DNA showed increased intensity of fragment staining, an increase in bifidobacterial numbers in colitic mice was indicated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PCR/DGGE analysis demonstrated an altered composition of the large bowel microbiota of colitic mice. This work will allow specific groups of bacteria to be targeted in future research concerning the pathogenesis of colitis.
TI  - Parasites in nosocomial diarrhoea: are they underestimated?
AB  - Nosocomial diarrhoea, defined as diarrhoea occurring more than 72 h after hospital admission, is reported to account for <1% of endemic nosocomial infections and 17% of epidemic nosocomial infections. The yield of diagnoses from stool cultures in nosocomial diarrhoea is low, and information regarding the role of parasites is limited. We conducted a study to determine the responsible bacterial and parasitological pathogens from nosocomial diarrhoea cases in our 2000-bed tertiary care facility over a 16-month period. Of 226 patients, Clostridium difficile toxins A or B were present in 5.5%, giardia cysts and/or trophozoites in 4.4%, Blastocytis hominis in 4.4% and Cryptosporidium sp. in 0.5% of samples. In conclusion, parasites should be sought in nosocomial diarrhoea in endemic areas.
TI  - Effect of medium composition on the production of tetanus toxin by Clostridium tetani.
AB  - The tetanus toxin is a neurotoxin synthesized by the bacillus Clostridium tetani  that, after detoxification with formaldehyde, still exhibits antigenic and immunologic properties, hence its denomination of tetanus toxoid. Such a neurotoxin is produced by cultivation of the microorganism in vegetative form on a relatively complex specific medium containing glucose and peptone. The simultaneous effects of the starting levels of glucose (G0) and N-Z Case TT (NZ0) as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, on the production of tetanus toxin have been investigated in this work in static cultivations by means of a five-level star-shaped experimental design and evaluated by response surface methodology (RSM) for optimization purposes. The highest final average yield of tetanus toxin (72 Lf/mL), achieved at G0= 9.7 g/L and NZ0= 43.5 g/L, was 80% higher than that obtained with standard cultivations (G0= 8.0 g/L and NZ0= 25.0 g/L).
TI  - RhoA/ROCK signaling is critical to FAK activation by cyclic stretch in cardiac myocytes.
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been shown to be activated in cardiac myocytes exposed to mechanical stress. However, details of how mechanical stimuli induce FAK activation are unknown. We investigated whether signaling events mediated by the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled coil-containing kinase (ROCK) pathway are involved in regulation of stretch-induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr(397) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Immunostaining showed that RhoA localized to regions of myofilaments alternated with phalloidin (actin) staining. The results of coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that FAK and RhoA are associated in nonstretched NRVMs, but cyclic stretch significantly reduced the amount of RhoA recovered from anti-FAK immunoprecipitates. Cyclic stretch induced rapid and sustained (up to 2 h) increases in phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr(397) and ERK1/2 at Thr(202)/Tyr(204). Blockade of RhoA/ROCK signaling by pharmacological inhibitors of RhoA (Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme) or ROCK (Y-27632, 10 micromol/l, 1 h) markedly attenuated stretch-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similar effects were observed in cells treated with the inhibitor of actin polymerization cytochalasin D. Transfection of NRVMs with RhoA antisense oligonucleotide attenuated stretch-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA. Similar results were seen in cells transfected with FAK antisense oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK signaling plays a crucial role in stretch-induced FAK phosphorylation, presumably by coordinating upstream events operationally linked to the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Novel psychrophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacterium from the overcooled water brine in permafrost: description Clostridium algoriphilum sp. nov.
AB  - A gram-positive, motile, strict anaerobic spore-forming bacterium was isolated from the over-cooled brine in the permafrost. The optimal temperature for isolate growth was 5-6 degrees C at pH 6.8-7.2. The bacterium was growing on the medium rich in saccharides and disaccharides. Out of polysaccharides tested, only xylan sustained the growth. Fermentation of the hexoses led to the formation of acetate, butyrate, lactate, H2,CO2 and some formate and ethanol. Cell wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major fatty acids of the cell wall were C(14:0) and C(16:1c9). The content of G-C pairs in DNA was 31.4 mol%. As phylogenetic analysis has shown, it is closely linked to the members of cluster 1 of Clostridium. It differs from the other species of the genus by the substrates necessary for the growth, products forming as a result of the fermentation and content of the fatty acids in the cell wall. Thus, it was suggested to describe this strain as a new species named Clostridium algoriphilum. Type strain 14D1 was deposited into the Russian Collection of the Microorganisms VKM B-2271T and German Collection of the Microorganisms DSM 16153T .
TI  - Biotransformation of CL-20 by a dehydrogenase enzyme from Clostridium sp. EDB2.
AB  - In a previous study, a marine isolate Clostridium sp. EDB2 degraded 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) under anaerobic conditions (Bhushan B, Halasz A, Thiboutot S, Ampleman G, Hawari J (2004c) Chemotaxis-mediated biodegradation of cyclic nitramine explosives RDX, HMX, and CL-20 by Clostridium sp. EDB2. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 316:816-821); however, the enzyme responsible for CL-20 degradation was not known. In the present study, we isolated and purified an enzyme, from strain EDB2, responsible for CL-20 degradation. The enzyme was membrane-associated and NADH-dependent and had a molecular weight of 56 kDa (with SDS-PAGE). N-terminal amino acid sequence of enzyme revealed that it belonged to dehydrogenase class of enzymes. The purified enzyme degraded CL-20 at a rate of 18.5 nmol/h mg protein under anaerobic conditions. Carbon and nitrogen mass balance of the products were 100 and 64%, respectively. In LC-MS-MS studies, we detected three different initial metabolites from CL-20, i.e., mono-nitroso derivative, denitrohydrogenated product, and double-denitrated isomers with molecular weight of 422, 393, and 346 Da, corresponding to presumed empirical formulas of C(6)H(6)N(12)O(11), C(6)H(7)N(11)O(10), and C(6)H(6)N(10)O(8), respectively. Identity of all the three metabolites were confirmed by using ring-labeled [(15)N]CL-20 and the nitro-group-labeled [(15)NO(2)]CL-20. Taken together, the above data suggested that the enzyme degraded CL-20 via three different routes: Route A, via two single electron transfers necessary to release two nitro-groups from CL-20 to produce two double-denitrated isomers; Route B, via a hydride transfer necessary to produce a denitrohydrogenated product; and Route C, via transfer of two redox equivalents to CL-20 necessary to produce a mono-nitroso derivative of CL-20. This is the first biochemical study which showed that CL-20 degradation can be initiated via more than one pathway.
TI  - Fastidiosipila sanguinis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new Gram-positive, coccus-shaped  organism from human blood.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two strains of an unidentified Gram-positive, fastidious, non-spore-forming, coccus-shaped bacterium recovered from human blood. The organism was catalase-negative and grew under strictly anaerobic conditions and in the presence of 2 and 6 % O(2). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the unidentified bacterium was, phylogenetically, far removed from peptostreptococci and related Gram-positive coccus-shaped organisms, but exhibited a phylogenetic association with Clostridium rRNA cluster III [as defined by Collins et al., Int J Syst Bacteriol 44 (1994), 812-826]. Sequence divergence values of 15 % or more were observed between the unidentified bacterium and all other recognized species within this and related rRNA clostridial clusters. Treeing analysis showed that the unknown bacterium formed a deep line branching at the periphery of rRNA cluster III and represents a hitherto unknown genus within this supra-generic grouping. On the basis of both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium from blood be classified in a new genus, Fastidiosipila gen. nov., as Fastidiosipila sanguinis sp. nov. The type strain of Fastidiosipila sanguinis is CCUG 47711(T) (=CIP 108292(T)).
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Enhanced biosynthesis of dihydrodaidzein and dihydrogenistein by a newly isolated bovine rumen anaerobic bacterium.
AB  - A rod-shaped and Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, named Niu-O16, which was isolated from bovine rumen contents, was found to be capable of anaerobically converting isoflavones daidzein and genistein to dihydrodaidzein (DHD) and dihydrogenistein (DHG), respectively. The metabolites DHD and DHG were identified using EI-MS and NMR spectrometric analyses. Stereoisomeric metabolites, which were separated on chiral stationary phase HPLC, were formed in equal amounts by the strain Niu-O16. Tautomerization reaction occurred on the B-ring of DHD and DHG seems to be attributed to the equal production of stereoisomeric metabolites. For the synthesis of DHD, the strain Niu-O16 showed an optimal pH range from 6.0 to 7.0 and completely reduced up to 800 microM of daidzein to DHD with the initial OD600nm=1.0 and pH 7.0 for 3 days incubation. The strain Niu-O16, showed relatively faster reduction activity toward daidzein to produce DHD than the previously isolated human intestinal bacterium Clostridium sp. HGH6.
TI  - Thermosinus carboxydivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a new anaerobic, thermophilic, carbon-monoxide-oxidizing, hydrogenogenic bacterium from a hot pool of Yellowstone National Park.
AB  - A new anaerobic, thermophilic, facultatively carboxydotrophic bacterium, strain Nor1(T), was isolated from a hot spring at Norris Basin, Yellowstone National Park. Cells of strain Nor1(T) were curved motile rods with a length of 2.6-3 microm, a width of about 0.5 microm and lateral flagellation. The cell wall structure was of the Gram-negative type. Strain Nor1(T) was thermophilic (temperature range for growth was 40-68 degrees C, with an optimum at 60 degrees C) and neutrophilic (pH range for growth was 6.5-7.6, with an optimum at 6.8-7.0). It grew chemolithotrophically on CO (generation time, 1.15 h), producing equimolar quantities of H(2) and CO(2) according to the equation CO+H(2)O-->CO(2)+H(2). During growth on CO in the presence of ferric citrate or amorphous ferric iron oxide, strain Nor1(T) reduced ferric iron but produced H(2) and CO(2) at a ratio close to 1 : 1, and growth stimulation was slight. Growth on CO in the presence of sodium selenite was accompanied by precipitation of elemental selenium. Elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, sulfate and nitrate did not stimulate growth of strain Nor1(T) on CO and none of these chemicals was reduced. Strain Nor1(T) was able to grow on glucose, sucrose, lactose, arabinose, maltose, fructose, xylose and pyruvate, but not on cellobiose, galactose, peptone, yeast extract, lactate, acetate, formate, ethanol, methanol or sodium citrate. During glucose fermentation, acetate, H(2) and CO(2) were produced. Thiosulfate was found to enhance the growth rate and cell yield of strain Nor1(T) when it was grown on glucose, sucrose or lactose; in this case, acetate, H(2)S and CO(2) were produced. In the presence of thiosulfate or ferric iron, strain Nor1(T) was also able to grow on yeast extract. Lactate, acetate, formate and H(2) were not utilized either in the absence or in the presence of ferric iron, thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur or nitrate. Growth was completely inhibited by penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin. The DNA G+C content of the strain was 51.7+/-1 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain Nor1(T) belongs to the Bacillus-Clostridium phylum of the Gram-positive bacteria. On the basis of the studied phenotypic and phylogenetic features, we propose that strain Nor1(T) be assigned to a new genus, Thermosinus gen. nov. The type species is Thermosinus carboxydivorans sp. nov. (type strain, Nor1(T)=DSM 14886(T)=VKM B-2281(T)).
TI  - Acetanaerobacterium elongatum gen. nov., sp. nov., from paper mill waste water.
AB  - Two mesophilic anaerobic bacterial strains (Z7(T) and Z1) were isolated from waste water sludge of the Xinanzhang paper mill, Beijing, China. The strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming and motile. Cells were thin rods (0.2-0.4x4.0-8.0 microm). Growth of the strains was observed at 20-42 degrees C and pH 5.0-7.5. Both strains hydrolysed gelatin and aesculin and fermented several kinds of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. The fermentation end products formed from glucose were acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The predominant cellular fatty acids were the branched-chain fatty acids isoC(15 : 0) (42.83 %) and isoC(14 : 0) (32.11 %). The DNA G+C contents of strains Z7(T) and Z1 were 50.4 and 48.6 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates represent a new phyletic sublineage within the Clostridium leptum rRNA cluster, with <91 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to currently described species. On the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, Acetanaerobacterium elongatum gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel genus and species, is proposed, with strain Z7(T) (=JCM 12359(T)=AS 1.5012(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Clostridium straminisolvens sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic, aerotolerant and cellulolytic bacterium isolated from a cellulose-degrading bacterial community.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, thermophilic and cellulolytic bacterium (strain CSK1(T)) was isolated from a cellulose-degrading bacterial community. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CSK1(T) was mapped to cluster III of the genus Clostridium. Strain CSK1(T) is closely related to Clostridium thermocellum (96.2 %) and Clostridium aldrichii (95.1 %). Strain CSK1(T) is a non-motile, spore-forming, straight or slightly curved rod. The optimum temperature and initial pH for its growth and cellulose degradation are 50-55 degrees C and pH 7.5. Strain CSK1(T) grew under a gas phase containing up to 4 % O(2). Phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses support the differentiation of strain CSK1(T) from its closest relatives. Strain CSK1(T) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Clostridium straminisolvens sp. nov. is proposed, with CSK1(T) (=DSM 16021(T)=IAM 15070(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Microbiological quality of petfood in Poland.
AB  - From epidemiological and safety point of view, petfoods produced from edible and  non-edible animal by-products should be safe for slaughter animals, owners of these pets and environment. Domestic animals are recognized as highly important reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms for man. The close contact of people and especially children with pets may constitute a serious hazard for their health. Taking these aspects into account, the study was undertaken in which 2271 dried and 18 canned petfood samples were examined. Moreover, 14, 90, 23 and 22 samples of petfoods were examined for presence or number of Clostridium sp., Enterobacteriaceae, total plate count, and yeast and moulds, respectively. Salmonella was isolated from 22 (1%) out of 2271 dried petfood samples examined. Number of Enterobacteriaceae was higher than 300 cfu/g, i.e. the allowed maximum level was found in 9 (10%) samples examined. The rest of microbiological quality parameters did not exceed the allowed values.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial flora in contaminated soil as a countermeasure against H2S gas production].
AB  - Gas productions in illegal dumping sites and waste landfills have caused serious  problems. The gas production was induced by bacterial flora inhabited soils. In order to construct a culture independent evaluation system of the soil bacteria, bacterial communities were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, about 16 soil samples at 4 sites, both using culture and culture-independent methods. The real time PCR method was developed for counting total bacterial number. Sequencing analysis of 16S rDNA amplified by a direct PCR method revealed that non-spore forming sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were detected at a similar frequency at an illegal dumping site near mountains. On the other hand, spore-forming sulfate reducing bacteria and Clostridium sp. were mainly detected in deep samples at reclaimed landfills from the sea, whereas sulfur-oxidizing bacteria was hardly detected. The result regarding sulfate-reducing bacteria was confirmed also by an anaerobic culture method. Culture-independent molecular analyses of soil bacteria would give us useful information for prediction of gas production and for the evaluation of soil equilibrium.
TI  - [Anaerobic intestinal microflora in pathogenesis of autism?].
AB  - The present study provides information on differences in the gastrointestinal microflora of children with autism compared with a control group. Special attention was paid to the microbiological characteristic of the new obligate anaerobic microorganisms: Clostridium bolteae sp.nov. and Cetobacterium somerae sp.nov. observed in stools of children with autism. In light of recent publications, the hypothesis of interactions between intestinal microflora - and the brain based on possible alterations in bacterial toxins and other metabolites in the pathogenesis of autism is discussed.
TI  - Propanol as an end product of threonine fermentation.
AB  - Clostridium sp. strain 17cr1 was able to ferment L-threonine to propionate and propanol. Electrons arising in the oxidation of 2-oxobutyrate to propionyl-CoA were apparently used in reductive pathway leading to propanol formation. Part of the propionyl-CoA was used to form propionate in an ATP-forming pathway via a propionate kinase, so that the final ATP yield was 0.5 mol per mol of L-threonine metabolised. Other growth substrates were fermented mainly to acetate and butyrate, and the reductive formation of butyrate, from 2 mol of acetyl-CoA or from crotonate or 3-hydroxybutyrate, was the main route for recycling reduced electron carriers arising during oxidative pathways for most substrates.
TI  - Clostridium jejuense sp. nov., isolated from soil.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, endospore-forming bacterium, designated strain  HY-35-12T, was isolated from a soil sample in Jeju, Korea. Cells of this isolate were Gram-positive, motile rods that formed oval to spherical terminal spores. Strain HY-35-12T grew optimally at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0 and 0-0.5 % (w/v) NaCl. The isolate produced pyruvate, lactate, acetate, formate and hydrogen as fermentation end products from glucose. The G + C content of DNA of the isolate was 41 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism formed a monophyletic clade with Clostridium xylanovorans and Clostridium aminovalericum in cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium. The closest phylogenetic neighbour was C. xylanovorans, with 96.65 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Several physiological and chemotaxonomic properties were identified that enable strain HY-35-12T to be distinguished from phylogenetically related clostridia. On the basis of polyphasic characteristics, it is proposed that strain HY-35-12T (= IMSNU 40003T = KCTC 5026T = DSM 15929T) represents a novel species, Clostridium jejuense sp. nov.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Giardia and Cryptosporidium in source waters of Sao Paulo State, Brazil.
AB  - Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum are two protozoan intestinal parasites responsible for many drinking-water-related disease outbreaks in recent years. They are very resistant to conventional water treatment processes, can persist for long times in the environment and are, therefore, of great concern for public health. This work aimed to evaluate the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in water sources from Sao Paulo State, Brazil, as part of the "Evaluation of Inland Waters from Sao Paulo State" project from CETESB. Over a period of 19 months, 278 water samples from 28 sites located in 10 watersheds were analysed. The immunofluorescence assay was used after concentration of the samples by the calcium carbonate flocculation technique. Thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens were also determined in order to verify the existence of correlation between these bacterial indicators and the protozoa. Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in 27% and 2.5% of the samples, respectively, a lower figure compared with the results reported by other authors, especially for Cryptosporidium. A Spearman rank correlation test demonstrated a significant correlation between Giardia and faecal indicator concentrations. According to the American Regulation of Monitoring (ICR), treated water from 16 of these 28 collection sites should also be analysed to evaluate whether the treatment process could remove the parasites. Some technical deficiencies of these methods still limit the utilisation of the monitoring results for public health decisions, but the data here reported will help to improve the quality of drinking water in Sao Paulo State.
TI  - A review of outbreaks of foodborne disease associated with passenger ships: evidence for risk management.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Foodborne disease outbreaks on ships are of concern because of their potentially serious health consequences for passengers and crew and high costs to the industry. The authors conducted a review of outbreaks of foodborne diseases associated with passenger ships in the framework of a World Health Organization project on setting guidelines for ship sanitation. METHODS: The authors reviewed data on 50 outbreaks of foodborne disease associated with passenger ships. For each outbreak, data on pathogens/toxins, type of ship, factors contributing to outbreaks, mortality and morbidity, and food vehicles were collected. RESULTS: The findings of this review show that the majority of reported outbreaks were associated with cruise ships and that almost 10,000 people were affected. Salmonella spp were most frequently associated with outbreaks. Foodborne outbreaks due to enterotoxigenic E. coli spp, Shigella spp, noroviruses (formally called Norwalk-like viruses), Vibrio spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora sp, and Trichinella sp also occurred on ships. Factors associated with the outbreaks reviewed include inadequate temperature control, infected food handlers, contaminated raw ingredients, cross-contamination, inadequate heat treatment, and onshore excursions. Seafood was the most common food vehicle implicated in outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Many ship-associated outbreaks could have been prevented if measures had been taken to ensure adequate temperature control, avoidance of cross-contamination, reliable food sources, adequate heat treatment, and exclusion of infected food handlers from work.
TI  - Biological hydrogen production using a membrane bioreactor.
AB  - A cross-flow membrane was coupled to a chemostat to create an anaerobic membrane  bioreactor (MBR) for biological hydrogen production. The reactor was fed glucose (10,000 mg/L) and inoculated with a soil inoculum heat-treated to kill non-spore-forming methanogens. Hydrogen gas was consistently produced at a concentration of 57-60% in the headspace under all conditions. When operated in chemostat mode (no flow through the membrane) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.3 h, 90% of the glucose was removed, producing 2200 mg/L of cells and 500 mL/h of biogas. When operated in MBR mode, the solids retention time (SRT) was increased to SRT = 12 h producing a solids concentration in the reactor of 5800 mg/L. This SRT increased the overall glucose utilization (98%), the biogas production rate (640 mL/h), and the conversion efficiency of glucose-to-hydrogen from 22% (no MBR) to 25% (based on a maximum of 4 mol-H(2)/mol-glucose). When the SRT was increased from 5 h to 48 h, glucose utilization (99%) and biomass concentrations (8,800 +/- 600 mg/L) both increased. However, the biogas production decreased (310 +/- 40 mL/h) and the glucose-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency decreased from 37 +/- 4% to 18 +/- 3%. Sustained permeate flows through the membrane were in the range of 57 to 60 L/m(2) h for three different membrane pore sizes (0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 microm). Most (93.7% to 99.3%) of the membrane resistance was due to internal fouling and the reversible cake resistance, and not the membrane itself. Regular backpulsing was essential for maintaining permeate flux through the membrane. Analysis of DNA sequences using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis indicated bacteria were most closely related to members of Clostridiaceae and Flexibacteraceae, including Clostridium acidisoli CAC237756 (97%), Linmingia china AF481148 (97%), and Cytophaga sp. MDA2507 AF238333 (99%). No PCR amplification of 16s rRNA genes was obtained when archaea-specific primers were used.
TI  - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) requirement in Clostridium difficile toxin  A-mediated intestinal inflammation.
AB  - Clostridium difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-associated colitis, mediates inflammatory diarrhea by releasing toxin A, a potent 308-kDa enterotoxin. Toxin A-induced inflammatory diarrhea involves many steps, including mucosal release of substance P (SP) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neutrophil transmigration. Here we demonstrate that, compared with wild type, mice genetically deficient in CRH (Crh(-/-)) have dramatically reduced ileal fluid secretion, epithelial cell damage, and neutrophil transmigration 4 h after intraluminal toxin A administration. This response is associated with diminished mucosal activity of the neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase compared with that of wildtype mice. In wild-type mice, toxin A stimulates an increase in intestinal SP content compared with buffer administration. In contrast, toxin A administration in Crh(-/-) mice fails to result in an increased SP content. Moreover, immunohistochemical experiments showed that CRH and SP are colocalized in some enteric nerves of wild-type mice, and this colocalization is more evident after toxin A administration. These results provide direct evidence for a major proinflammatory role for CRH in the pathophysiology of enterotoxin-mediated inflammatory diarrhea and indicate a SP-linked pathway.
TI  - Spatial distribution and stability of the eight microbial species of the altered  schaedler flora in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - The overall complexity of the microbial communities in the gastrointestinal (GI)  tracts of mammals has hindered observations of dynamics and interactions of individual bacterial populations. However, such information is crucial for understanding the diverse disease-causing and protective roles that gut microbiota play in their hosts. Here, we determine the spatial distribution, interanimal variation, and persistence of bacteria in the most complex defined-flora (gnotobiotic) model system to date, viz., mice colonized with the eight strains of the altered Schaedler flora (ASF). Quantitative PCR protocols based on the 16S rRNA sequence of each ASF strain were developed and optimized to specifically detect as few as 10 copies of each target. Total numbers of the ASF strains were determined in the different regions of the GI tracts of three C.B-17 SCID mice. Individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with microaerotolerant Lactobacillus murinus ASF361 present at 10(5) to 10(7) cells/g of tissue in the upper GI tract and obligate anaerobic ASF strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 10(8) to 10(10) cells/g of tissue. The variation between the three mice was small for most ASF strains, except for Clostridium sp. strain ASF502 and Bacteroides sp. strain ASF519 in the cecum. A comparison of the relative distribution of the ASF strains in feces and the colon indicated large differences, suggesting that fecal bacterial levels may provide a poor approximation of colonic bacterial levels. All ASF strains were detected by PCR in the feces of C57BL/6 restricted flora mice, which had been maintained in an isolator without sterile food, water, or bedding for several generations, providing evidence for the stability of these strains in the face of potential competition by bacteria introduced into the gut.
TI  - Control of expression of the lectin-like protein Reg-1 by gastrin: role of the Rho family GTPase RhoA and a C-rich promoter element.
AB  - The expression of members of the Reg family of secreted lectin-like proteins is increased in response to stress, inflammation and damage in many tissues. In the stomach, Reg is located in enterochromaffin-like cells, where its expression is stimulated by the gastric hormone gastrin. We have examined the mechanisms by which gastrin stimulates expression of Reg-1. Deletional mutations of 2.1 to 0.1 kb of the rat Reg-1 promoter in a luciferase reporter vector were transiently transfected into gastric cancer AGS-G(R) cells. All promoter fragments tested showed similar relative increases in luciferase expression in response to gastrin (1 nM). The response to gastrin of the smallest (104 bp) construct was 4.2+/-0.4-fold over basal. These responses were reduced by Ro-32-0432, a protein kinase C inhibitor, by C3-transferase, a Clostridium botulinum toxin and a selective inhibitor of the Rho family GTPase RhoA, and by co-transfection with a dominant negative form of RhoA. Co-transfection with a constitutively active form of RhoA stimulated expression 11.6+/-1.7-fold over basal. Mutations through the 104 bp construct identified a C-rich element (C-79CCCTCCC-72) required for responses to gastrin, PKC (protein kinase C) and L63RhoA (the constitutively active form of human RhoA protein containing a glutamine-to-leucine substitution at position 63). EMSAs (electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays) using nuclear extracts of control and gastrin-stimulated AGS-G(R) cells and a probe spanning -86 to -64 bp revealed multiple binding proteins. There was no effect of gastrin on the pattern of binding. Supershift assays indicated that transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 bound the C-rich sequence. We conclude that gastrin stimulates Reg expression via activation of PKC and RhoA, that a C-rich region (-79 to -72) is critical for the response and that Sp-family transcription factors bind to this region of the promoter.
TI  - Survey of peafowl (Pavo cristatus) for potential pathogens at three Michigan zoos.
AB  - Blood samples collected from 31 free-roaming peafowl from three zoos in Michigan  were tested serologically. Antibody titers were present against avian adenovirus and Bordetella avium in 19.3% and 61.3% of the samples, respectively. Serum plate agglutination tests were positive for Mycoplasma meleagridis and Mycoplasma synoviae in 3.2% and 38.7% of the samples, respectively. All birds were seronegative for avian influenza, Newcastle disease virus, West Nile virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella typhimurium, and Giardia sp. No parasites were seen in blood smears. Cloacal swabs were cultured for anaerobic, aerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens type A and Escherichia coli were cultured most frequently from 64.5% and 29% of the samples, respectively, whereas Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were not isolated. Fecal samples contained moderate numbers of ascarid and Capillaria sp. ova and coccidian oocysts. Female biting lice (Goniodes gigas) were identified on three birds.
TI  - Identification, detection, and spatial resolution of Clostridium populations responsible for cellulose degradation in a methanogenic landfill leachate bioreactor.
AB  - An anaerobic landfill leachate bioreactor was operated with crystalline cellulose and sterile landfill leachate until a steady state was reached. Cellulose hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis were measured. Microorganisms attached to the cellulose surfaces were hypothesized to be the cellulose hydrolyzers. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were prepared from this attached fraction and also from the mixed fraction (biomass associated with cellulose particles and in the planktonic phase). Both clone libraries were dominated by Firmicutes phylum sequences (100% of the attached library and 90% of the mixed library), and the majority fell into one of five lineages of the clostridia. Clone group 1 (most closely related to Clostridium stercorarium), clone group 2 (most closely related to Clostridium thermocellum), and clone group 5 (most closely related to Bacteroides cellulosolvens) comprised sequences in Clostridium group III. Clone group 3 sequences were in Clostridium group XIVa (most closely related to Clostridium sp. strain XB90). Clone group 4 sequences were affiliated with a deeply branching clostridial lineage peripherally associated with Clostridium group VI. This monophyletic group comprises a new Clostridium cluster, designated cluster VIa. Specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for the five groups were designed and synthesized, and it was demonstrated in FISH experiments that bacteria targeted by the probes for clone groups 1, 2, 4, and 5 were very abundant on the surfaces of the cellulose particles and likely the key cellulolytic microorganisms in the landfill bioreactor. The FISH probe for clone group 3 targeted cells in the planktonic phase, and these organisms were hypothesized to be glucose fermenters.
TI  - Chemotaxis-mediated biodegradation of cyclic nitramine explosives RDX, HMX, and CL-20 by Clostridium sp. EDB2.
AB  - Cyclic nitramine explosives, RDX, HMX, and CL-20 are hydrophobic pollutants with  very little aqueous solubility. In sediment and soil environments, they are often attached to solid surfaces and/or trapped in pores and distribute heterogeneously in aqueous environments. For efficient bioremediation of these explosives, the microorganism(s) must access them by chemotaxis ability. In the present study, we isolated an obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium sp. strain EDB2 from a marine sediment. Strain EDB2, motile with numerous peritrichous flagella, demonstrated chemotactic response towards RDX, HMX, CL-20, and NO(2)(-). The three explosives were biotransformed by strain EDB2 via N-denitration with concomitant release of NO(2)(-). Biotransformation rates of RDX, HMX, and CL-20 by the resting cells of strain EDB2 were 1.8+/-0.2, 1.1+/-0.1, and 2.6+/-0.2nmol h(-1)mgwet biomass(-1) (mean+/-SD; n=3), respectively. We found that commonly seen RDX metabolites such as TNX, methylenedinitramine, and 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal neither produced NO(2)(-) during reaction with strain EDB2 nor they elicited chemotaxis response in strain EDB2. The above data suggested that NO(2)(-) released from explosives during their biotransformation might have elicited chemotaxis response in the bacterium. Biodegradation and chemotactic ability of strain EDB2 renders it useful in accelerating the bioremediation of explosives under in situ conditions.
TI  - Stimulation of microbial sulphate reduction in a constructed wetland: microbiological and geochemical analysis.
AB  - Microbial sulphate reduction was stimulated successfully in enclosures installed  in a constructed wetland. When sucrose (2.4mM) and NH(4)Cl (600 microM) were added to water in the test enclosures, the indigenous microbial community was able to remove over 90% of the sulphate, present as a contaminant from nearby mining activity at a concentration of 384 mg x l(-1) (4mM), over 50 days. Over 90% of the sucrose was also removed. Sulphate was not reduced in control enclosures containing no added sucrose or NH(4)Cl. Fermentation of sucrose by obligate anaerobes including Clostridium sp. and Bacteriodes sp. preceded sulphate reduction in the test enclosures. Sulphate reduction was biphasic, with maximum rates noted between 2-5 and 23-27 days after the addition of the growth substrates. Relatively unbiased 16S rDNA analysis suggested that nitrogen-fixing bacteria were important constituents of the microbial community in the test enclosures at day 23, suggesting that soluble nitrogen was limiting in the amended test enclosures during the experiment.
TI  - Isolation from oil reservoirs of novel thermophilic anaerobes phylogenetically related to Thermoanaerobacter subterraneus: reassignment of T. subterraneus, Thermoanaerobacter yonseiensis, Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis and Carboxydibrachium pacificum to Caldanaerobacter subterraneus gen. nov., sp. nov., comb. nov. as four novel subspecies.
AB  - Novel thermophilic, anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria, strains SL9 and OCA1, were isolated from oilfields in France and Australia, respectively. Both strains, together with Thermoanaerobacter yonseiensis KB-1(T) (=DSM 13777(T)), Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis MB4(T) (=DSM 15242(T)) and Carboxydibrachium pacificum JM(T) (=DSM 12653(T)), possessed genomic (DNA-DNA hybridization studies) and phylogenetic similarities with Thermoanaerobacter subterraneus SEBR 7858(T) (=DSM 13054(T)), which was isolated recently from an oilfield reservoir in south-west France. Marked phenotypic differences exist between the three oilfield isolates (T. subterraneus, strain OCA1 and strain SL9): they include temperature range for growth and substrates used. Differences were also observed in the DNA G+C contents of all organisms. Similarly to T. subterraneus, strains SL9 and OCA1, and also T. yonseiensis, T. tengcongensis and Carboxydibrachium pacificum, produced acetate and L-alanine as major end products of glucose metabolism [0.8-1.0 mol L-alanine produced (mol glucose consumed)(-1)] and reduced thiosulfate, but not sulfate, to sulfide. Because of these significant metabolic and phylogenetic differences between the oilfield isolates (T. subterraneus, strain OCA1 and strain SL9), T. yonseiensis, T. tengcongensis and Carboxydibrachium pacificum and other Thermoanaerobacter species, it is proposed to reassign them as a novel genus and species, Caldanaerobacter subterraneus gen. nov., sp. nov., comb. nov., with the creation of four novel subspecies, Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. subterraneus subsp. nov., comb. nov., Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. yonseiensis subsp. nov., comb. nov., Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. tengcongensis subsp. nov., comb. nov. and Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. pacificus subsp. nov., comb. nov.
TI  - Tepidibacter formicigenes sp. nov., a novel spore-forming bacterium isolated from a Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vent.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, Gram-positive, sporulating and strictly chemoorganoheterotrophic bacterium, designated strain DV1184(T), was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent sample from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The cells were short, straight rods (4 micro m long and 0.8 micro m wide) and were motile with peritrichous flagella. They grew between 35 and 55 degrees C (optimum, 45 degrees C), between pH 5.0 and 8.0 (optimum, 6.0) and at 20-60 g sea salts l(-1) (optimum sea salts concentration, 30 g l(-1)). Strain DV1184(T) was able to ferment yeast extract, tryptone, peptone, glucose, sucrose, maltose and pyruvate. The main fermentation products from glucose were (in decreasing order) formate, acetate and ethanol. The genomic DNA G+C content was 29 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene located the strain within cluster XI of the lineage that encompasses the genus Clostridium and related genera in the bacterial domain. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence comparison and physiological and biochemical characteristics, it is proposed that the isolate should be described as a novel species, Tepidibacter formicigenes sp. nov. The type strain is DV1184(T) (=CIP 107893(T)=DSM 15518(T)).
TI  - Anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov., from human faeces.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two isolates of an unidentified Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from human faeces. The organisms were catalase-negative, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of metabolism and possessed a DNA G+C content of approximately 54 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the two isolates were related closely to each other and formed a hitherto unknown sublineage within the Clostridium leptum rRNA cluster of organisms. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a novel genus as Anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerotruncus colihominis is WAL 14565(T)=CCUG 45055(T)=CIP 107754(T).
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - [Analysis of the anaerobic microbial community capable of degrading p-toluene sulphonate].
AB  - Three strains of Clostridium sp., 14 (VKM B-2201), 42 (VKM B-2202), and 21 (VKM B-2279), two methanogens, Methanobacterium formicicum MH (VKM B-2198) and Methanosarcina mazei MM (VKM B-2199), and one sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio sp. SR1 (VKM B-2200), were isolated in pure cultures from an anaerobic microbial community capable of degrading p-toluene sulfonate. Strain 14 was able to degrade p-toluene sulfonate in the presence of yeast extract and bactotryptone and, like strain 42, to utilize p-toluene sulfonate as the sole sulfur source with the production of toluene. p-Toluene sulfonate stimulated the growth of Ms. mazei MM on acetate. The sulfate-reducing strain Desulfovibrio sp. SR1 utilized p-toluene sulfonate as an electron acceptor. The putative scheme of p-toluene sulfonate degradation by the anaerobic microbial community is discussed.
TI  - Hespellia stercorisuis gen. nov., sp. nov. and Hespellia porcina sp. nov., isolated from swine manure storage pits.
AB  - Four Gram-positive-staining, strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped organisms were isolated from a pig manure storage pit. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolates belonged to two related but distinct groups. Sequence analysis showed that the two groups of isolates were highly related to each other (approx. 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), forming a distinct cluster within the Clostridium coccoides suprageneric rDNA grouping. Biochemical and physiological studies confirmed the division of the isolates into two related, albeit distinct, groups. Based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unidentified rod-shaped isolates from pig manure should be classified in a novel genus, Hespellia gen. nov., as Hespellia stercorisuis sp. nov. and Hespellia porcina sp. nov. The type species of the novel genus is H. stercorisuis (type strain, PC18T=NRRL B-23456T=CCUG 46279T=ATCC BAA-677T) and the type strain of H. porcina is PC80T (=NRRL B-23458T=ATCC BAA-674T).
TI  - [Phenotype and genotype of Clostridium sp. strains producing botulism neurotoxin].
AB  - Neurotoxins produced by strains of Clostridium sp. are belonging to the most toxic biological substances. In the study phenotypes and genotypes of C. botulinum strains in animal studies in vivo and on the DNA level were evaluated, respectively. Additionally, the presence of genes encoding BoNT toxins of A, B, and E types among strains of Clostridium sp. were identified. In case of C. botulinum DNA was isolated from vegetative bacterial cells and from spores. Two different genes encoding two different neurotoxins harboured by three strains of Ae biotype/ae genotype, and by two strains of B biotype/be genotype were detected. Additionally, above E type C. botulinum strains, the presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, was found in genome of two C. baratii, two C. butyricum, and C. bifidobacterium, and C. oedematicum strains. C. bifidobacterium and C. oedematicum strains positive for presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, were found negative for E neurotoxin production in vivo in TN test. The study indicates that genes encoding BoNT/E neurotoxins are very common among Clostridium species. Phenotype and genotype analysis indicated co-presence of B phenotype together with be genotype and A phenotype together with ae genotype among C. botulinum strains.
TI  - Microbial utilisation of natural organic wastes.
AB  - The waste management strategy for the future should meet the benefits of humanity safety, respect principals of planet ecology, and compatibility with other habitability systems. For these purpose the waste management technologies, relevant to application of the biodegradation properties of bacteria are of great value. The biological treatment method is based upon the biodegradation of organic substances by various microorganisms. The advantage of the biodegradation waste management in general: it allows to diminish the volume of organic wastes, the biological hazard of the wastes is controlled, and this system may be compatible with the other systems. The objectives of our study were: to evaluate effectiveness of microbial biodegradation of non-pretreated substrate, to construct phneumoautomatic digester for organic wastes biodegradation, and to study microbial characteristics of active sludge samples used as inoculi in biodegradation experiment. The technology of vegetable wastes treatment was elaborated in IBMP and BMSTU. For this purpose the special unit was created where the degradation process is activated by enforced reinvention of portions of elaborated biogas into digester. This technology allows to save energy normally used for electromechanical agitation and to create optimal environment for anaerobic bacteria growth. The investigations were performed on waste simulator, which imitates physical and chemical content of food wastes calculated basing on the data on food wastes of moderate Russian city. The volume of created experimental sample of digester is 40 l. The basic system elements of device are digesters, gas receiver, remover of drops and valve monitoring and thermal control system. In our testing we used natural food wastes to measure basic parameters and time of biodegradation process. The diminution rate of organic gained 76% from initial mass taking part within 9 days of fermentation. The biogas production achieved 46 l per 1 kg of substrate. The microbial studies of biodegradation process revealed following peculiarities: (i) gradual quantitative increasing of Lactobacillus sp. (from 10(3) to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU) per ml), (ii) activation of Clostridia sp. (from 10(2) to 10(4)CFU/ml), (iii) elimination of aerobic conventional pathogens (Enterobacteriaceae sp., Protea sp., staphylococci). The obtained results allow to evaluate effectiveness of proposed technology and to determine the leading role of lactobacilli and clostridia in process of natural wastes biodegradation. Our further investigations shall further be concentrated on creation of artificial inoculi for launching of food wastes biodegradation. These inoculi will include active and adapted strains of clostridia and lactobacilli.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  - We have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, W-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kDa. Here, we emend the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., Aeromonas caviae W-61) to Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (Xyn5) in Escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of Xyn5. xyn5 encodes 1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. Sequence analysis indicated that Xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 CBM, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of Clostridium thermocellum SdbA, and three S-layer-homologous (SLH) domains. Recombinant Xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, Avicel PH-101, while an N-terminal 90-kDa fragment of Xyn5, which lacks the C-terminal half of the family 9 CBM, did not bind to Avicel PH-101. Xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kDa. Xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated S layer. Thus, Paenibacillus sp. strain W-61 Xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and SLH domains. Possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain W-61 is discussed on the basis of the modular structure of Xyn5.
TI  - Soehngenia saccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov. and Clostridium amygdalinum sp. nov., two novel anaerobic, benzaldehyde-converting bacteria.
AB  - Two anaerobic, benzaldehyde-converting bacteria were isolated from an anaerobic upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB)-reactor treating potato starch waste water. Strain BOR-Y(T) converted benzaldehyde to benzoate and benzylalcohol in approximately equimolar concentrations. Benzaldehyde conversion did not support growth. Strain BOR-Y(T) was Gram-positive and rod-shaped, and its cells were slightly thickened in the middle. The strain was a mesophilic spore-former that grew between 15 and 40 degrees C, with optimum growth at 30-37 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was pH 7.0. Strain BOR-Y(T) grew on a wide range of carbohydrates and some other carbon sources including yeast extract, cysteine and serine. The G+C content of its DNA was 42 mol%. According to physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization with its phylogenetic neighbours, strain BOR-Y(T) belongs to a novel genus of cluster XII of the clostridia, namely Soehngenia; the name Soehngenia saccharolytica is proposed for the type species (type strain BOR-Y(T)=DSM 12858(T)=ATCC BAA-502(T)). Strain BR-10(T) reduced benzaldehyde to benzylalcohol. This conversion was coupled to growth. In a medium containing yeast extract, the presence of benzaldehyde resulted in the accumulation of more than twofold more cells. Strain BR-10(T) was a Gram-positive organism that was characterized by oval- or rod-shaped cells with oval ends, which occurred singly, in pairs or sometimes in chains. The strain was moderately thermophilic and grew between 20 and 60 degrees C, with optimum growth at 45 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was between pH 7.0 and 7.5. Strain BR-10(T) grew on a wide range of carbon sources including carbohydrates, yeast extract, casein and some amino acids. The G+C content of its DNA was 32 mol%. As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain BR-10(T) represents a novel species of cluster XIVa of the clostridia; the name Clostridium amygdalinum is proposed for this novel species (type strain BR-10(T)=DSM 12857(T)=ATCC BAA-501(T)).
TI  - Optimization of initial substrate and pH levels for germination of sporing hydrogen-producing anaerobes in cow dung compost.
AB  - Biohydrogen production by anaerobic microbes enriched from heat-shocked cow dung  compost was studied by using an artificial medium containing sucrose. Initial pH and substrate levels were selected as target factors in this study. Our experimental results demonstrated that optimal substrate concentration and pH for the composts generating hydrogen gas were 4.0+/-0.5 g sucrose/l and 5.4+/-0.2, respectively. Supplementary experiments confirmed that chemical oxygen demand reduction efficiency (69%) obtained from the conditions of sucrose=4.0 g/l and pH=5.5 was significantly greater than that (37%) from sucrose=5.0 g/l and pH=5.0. Experimental results of metabolites analysis led us to the conclusion that Clostridium sp. predominated in the anaerobic composts, suggesting that inocula used to seed the batch experiment can be obtained from a common natural source.
TI  - Mucilage secretion regulated by sex pheromones in Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex.
AB  - When mating-type plus (mt+) and minus (mt-) cells of the Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex were mixed in nitrogen-depleted mating medium, secretion of mucilage containing uronic acid from cells was markedly activated and the mucilage accumulated around the cells. Substances with the ability to stimulate mucilage secretion from mt+ and mt- cells were detected in media in which mt- and mt+ cells had been separately cultured, respectively. We designated the active substances secreted from mt+ and mt- cells mucilage secretion-stimulating pheromone (MS-SP)-plus and MS-SP-minus, respectively. Activity of MS-SP-plus and MS-SP-minus decreased to 20% level by incubation at 80 degrees C for 10 min. Light was indispensable for the secretion of mucilage. The secretion of MS-SP-plus and MS-SP-minus decreased with dark treatment. MS-SP-plus eluted at around 95 k from a gel filtration column, and reacted with antibodies against two subunits of protoplast-release-inducing protein (PR-IP), which induces protoplast release from mt- cells. MS-SP-minus eluted at around 20 k from a gel filtration column, and reacted with an antibody against the PR-IP inducer, which induces the secretion of PR-IP from mt+ cells. In addition, purified PR-IP and PR-IP inducer stimulated mucilage secretion from mt- and mt+ cells, respectively. These results strongly suggested that MS-SP-plus and MS-SP-minus were the same molecules as the PR-IP and the PR-IP inducer, respectively.
TI  - Beneficial effect of beta-mannanase feed enzyme on performance of chicks challenged with Eimerla sp. and Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of a beta-mannanase feed enzyme on the performance of broiler chicks subject to a necrotic enteritis disease challenge model involving oral inoculation of Eimeria sp. and Clostridium pefringens. Beta-mannanase is known to improve productive performance when added to poultry and swine diets. In both experiments, disease challenge in the absence of feed additives demonstrated significant reductions in performance as measured by weight gain, feed conversion, and the incidence of coccidial lesion scores. Significant mortality was also observed in challenged groups in Experiment 1. The disease challenge model was therefore judged as highly effective. Additions of a commonly used antibiotic, bacitracin methylene disalicilate (BMD), and coccidiostat, salinomycin, were highly effective in partially counteracting negative effects of the disease challenge. In both experiments, addition of beta-mannanase significantly improved performance and reduced lesion scores in disease-challenged groups. The degree of improvement was somewhat less than that afforded by a combination of BMD and salinomycin in Experiment 1 but was not different from that afforded by BMD alone in Experiment 2. We conclude that the beta-mannanase enzyme can play a role in circumstances where the use of antibiotics is not desired.
TI  - Formate-dependent growth and homoacetogenic fermentation by a bacterium from human feces: description of Bryantella formatexigens gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - Formate stimulates growth of a new bacterium from human feces. With high formate, it ferments glucose to acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The original isolate fermented vegetable cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose, but it lost this ability after storage at -76 degrees C. 16S rRNA gene sequencing identifies it as a distinct line within the Clostridium coccoides supra-generic rRNA grouping. We propose naming it Bryantella formatexigens gen. nov., sp. nov.
TI  - [Treatment of infections associated with Clostridium difficile].
AB  - Cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) associated with toxigenic C. difficile strains more frequently are described recently. In Polish studies diagnosis of AAD or PMC (pseudomembranous colitis) was confirmed by isolation of C. difficile strains in 52% of suspected cases. Strains of C. difficile were isolated also from samples taken from hospital environment (10.5% positive samples). Problem of C. difficile-associated infection is more frequently observed in Poland also because of uncontrolled using of wide spectrum antibiotics. These antibiotics destroy intestinal microflora--"colonization resistance factor". Cases of AAD or PMC were described even after treatment of patients by vancomycin or metronidazol--antibiotics of choice for treatment of C. difficile-associated diseases. Other risk factors as: age, long term hospitalization, previous surgery, colonoscopy are also taken into account, when C. difficile-associated infections are suspected. Different treatment methods of C. difficile-associated infections are reviewed here and discussed in light of recent publications.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium spp. and Clostridium difficile in children with acute diarrhea in Sao Paulo city, Brazil.
AB  - Species of Clostridium are widely distributed in the environment, inhabiting both human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders, such as diarrhea. In this study, the prevalence of Clostridium spp. and C. difficile, from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea, was examined. These children were admitted to 3 different hospitals for over 12 months. Eighteen (20%) and 19 (21%) stool specimens from children with (90) and without (91) diarrhea respectively, were positive to clostridia. Only 10 C. difficile strains were detected in 5.5% of the stool samples of children with diarrhea. None healthy children (without diarrhea) harbored C. difficile. From these 10 C. difficile, 9 were considered as toxigenic and genotyped as tcdA+/tcdB+ or tcdA-/tcdB+, and 1 strain as nontoxigenic (tcdA-/tdcB-). They were detected by the citotoxicity on VERO cells and by the multiplex-polymerase chain reaction. Thirty clinical fecal extracts produced minor alterations on VERO cells. The presence of C. difficile as a probable agent of acute diarrhea is suggested in several countries, but in this study, the presence of these organisms was not significant. More studies will be necessary to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile in diarrhoeal processes in children.
TI  - Tepidibacter thalassicus gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, fermentative bacterium from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.
AB  - A moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacterium (strain SC 562T) was isolated from a hydrothermal vent chimney located at 13 degrees N on the East-Pacific Rise at a depth of 2650 m. Cells of strain SC 562T were straight to slightly curved rods, which were 0.7-0.9 microm in diameter and 3.5-6.0 microm in length with peritrichous flagella. Strain SC 562T formed round, refractile endospores in terminally swollen sporangia. The temperature range for growth was 33-60 degrees C, with an optimum at 50 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 4.8-8.5, with an optimum at pH 6.5-6.8. Growth of strain SC 562T was observed at NaCl concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 6% (w/v). The substrates utilized by strain SC 562T included casein, peptone, albumin, yeast extract, beef extract, alanine plus proline and starch. Glucose, maltose, pyruvate, valine and arginine each slightly stimulated growth in the presence of yeast extract. The products of glucose fermentation were ethanol, acetate, H2 and CO2. Strain SC 562T reduced elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. The G + C content of the DNA of strain SC 562T was 24 mol%. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolated organism belonged to cluster XI of the Clostridium subphylum. On the basis of its physiological properties and phylogenetic analyses, it is proposed that strain SC 562T represents the sole species of a novel genus, Tepidibacter; the name Tepidibacter thalassicus is proposed for strain SC 562T (=DSM 15285T=UNIQEM 215T).
TI  - Clostridium caminithermale sp. nov., a slightly halophilic and moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated from an Atlantic deep-sea hydrothermal chimney.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, slightly halophilic and moderately thermophilic, sporulating rod designated strain DVird3T was isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples collected at a depth of approximately 800 m on the Atlantic Ocean Ridge. Strain DVird3T possessed a few laterally inserted flagella, had a DNA G + C content of 33.1 mol% and grew optimally at pH 6.6 and at 45 degrees C. Growth was observed at temperatures between 20 and 58 degrees C and at pH values between 5.8 and 8.2. The optimum NaCl concentration for growth was 3% sea salt (30 g l(-1)); no growth was observed in the presence of 15 or 60 g sea salt l(-1). Strain DVird3T is heterotrophic and utilizes some sugars and various single amino acids. Acetate was the main fatty acid detected from carbohydrate fermentation, together with H2 and CO2. Gelatin was used as an energy source. It performed the Stickland reaction. Phylogenetically, strain DVird3T branched with members of cluster XI of the order Clostridiales, with Clostridium halophilum as its closest relative (similarity of 94.6%). On the basis of its phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain DVird3T (= DSM 15212T = CIP 107654T) is proposed as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium caminithermale sp. nov.
TI  - Characterization of novel psychrophilic clostridia from an Antarctic microbial mat: description of Clostridium frigoris sp. nov., Clostridium lacusfryxellense sp. nov., Clostridium bowmanii sp. nov. and Clostridium psychrophilum sp. nov. and reclassification of Clostridium laramiense as Clostridium estertheticum subsp. laramiense subsp. nov.
AB  - Taxonomic studies were performed on four strains (D-1/D-an/IIT, C/C-an/B1T, A-1/C-an/C1T and A-1/C-an/IT) of anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria originally isolated from a mat sample retrieved from a shallow, moated area around Lake Fryxell, an Antarctic freshwater lake. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data indicated that these strains are affiliated with cluster I clostridia and form a coherent group with Clostridium estertheticum and Clostridium laramiense. Similarity values among 16S rRNA gene sequences within this assemblage ranged between 96.7 and 99.8%. Despite the close phylogenetic relationship, several distinguishing phenotypic traits were found among the novel strains using a polyphasic approach. All strains were psychrophilic, but the temperature optimum for growth differed markedly, ranging from 4 to 16 degrees C. In addition, substrate utilization patterns, fermentation end products, cellular fatty acid profiles and morphological traits enabled a clear differentiation between the strains. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed that each of the four novel strains represents a distinct species, with DNA-DNA similarity values to related strains in the range 16-62%. In contrast, the type strains of C. estertheticum and C. laramiense shared 79% DNA-DNA similarity, indicating a close relationship at the species level. On the basis of genetic and phenotypic properties, it is proposed to designate four novel species of the genus Clostridium to harbour the newly isolated strains: Clostridium frigoris sp. nov. (type strain D-1/D-an/IIT=DSM 14204T=ATCC BMAA-579T), Clostridium lacusfryxellense sp. nov. (type strain C/C-an/B1T=DSM 14205T=ATCC BAA-580T), Clostridium bowmaniisp. nov. (type strain A-1/C-an/C1T=DSM 14206T=ATCC BAA-581T) and Clostridium psychrophilum sp. nov. (type strain A-1/C-an/IT=DSM 14207T=ATCC BAA-582T). It is also proposed to unite C. laramiense and C. estertheticum under C. estertheticum. The subspecies C. estertheticum subsp. laramiense subsp. nov. is established, represented by strain ATCC 51254T (=DSM 14884T). The type strain of C. estertheticum subsp. estertheticum remains NCIMB 12511T (=DSM 8809T).
TI  - Alkaliphilus crotonatoxidans sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic, crotonate-dismutating bacterium isolated from a methanogenic environment.
AB  - Two bacterial strains were isolated from methanogenic butyrate-oxidizing mixed cultures. The cells were straight to slightly curved, gram-positive rods that were motile by means of multiple flagella and formed endospores. Growth was observed in the temperature range 15-45 degrees C (optimum 37 degrees C) and pH range 5.5-9.0 (optimum pH 7.5). The novel isolates were strictly anaerobic chemo-organotrophs capable of utilizing yeast extract, peptone, tryptone and a variety of sugars and organic acids, but not glucose. None of the accessory electron acceptors tested (elemental sulfur, thiosulfate or fumarate) improved growth, except crotonate, which was dismutated to butyrate and acetate. The G + C content of the DNA of one of the isolates, strain B11-2T, was 30.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence similarity between strain B11-2T and some other strictly anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria indicated that the novel isolates represented a species in cluster XI within the low-GC gram-positive bacteria, being most closely related to Alkaliphilus transvaalensis JCM 10712T. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain B11-2T and A. transvaalensis JCM 10712T was 21%. On the basis of physiological and molecular properties, and cellular fatty acid and cell wall compositions, the novel isolates are proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Alkaliphilus, for which the name Alkaliphilus crotonatoxidans is proposed (type strain B11-2T=AS 1.2897T=JCM 11672T).
TI  - Molecular identification of an alpha-L-rhamnosidase from Bacillus sp strain GL1 as an enzyme involved in complete metabolism of gellan.
AB  - The genes (rhaA and rhaB) for two alpha-L-rhamnosidases of Bacillus sp. strain GL1, which assimilates a bacterial polysaccharide (gellan), were cloned from a genomic DNA library of the bacterium constructed in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequences of the genes were determined. Gene rhaA (2661 bp) contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein (RhaA: 886 amino acids) with a molecular weight (MW) of 98280. Gene rhaB (2871 bp) contained an ORF encoding a protein (RhaB: 956 amino acids) with a MW of 106049. RhaA exhibited significant identity (41%) with alpha-L-rhamnosidase of Clostridium stercorarium, while RhaB showed slight homology with enzymes from other sources. An overexpression system for the two enzymes was constructed in E. coli, and the enzymes were purified and characterized. Both RhaA and RhaB were highly specific for rhamnosyl saccharides, including gellan disaccharide (rhamnosyl glucose) and naringin, and released rhamnose from substrates most efficiently at pH 6.5-7.0 and 40 degrees C. Bacillus sp. strain GL1 cells grown in a gellan medium produced only RhaB, indicating that RhaB plays a crucial role in the complete metabolism of gellan.
TI  - Toxin B of Clostridium difficile activates human VIP submucosal neurons, in part  via an IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
AB  - This study investigated whether toxin B of Clostridium difficile can activate human submucosal neurons and the involved pathways. Isolated segments of human colon were placed in organ culture for 3 h in the presence of toxin B or IL-1beta. Whole mounts of internal submucosal plexus were stained with antibodies against c-Fos, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and substance P (SP). The membrane potential (Vm) response of submucosal neurons to local application of toxin B and IL-1beta was determined by a multisite optical recording technique. Toxin B (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) increased the proportion of c-Fos-positive neurons dose dependently compared with the control. In the presence of toxin B (10 ng/ml), most c-Fos-positive neurons were immunoreactive for VIP (79.8 +/- 22.5%) but only 19.4 +/- 14.0% for SP. Toxin B induced a rapid rise in IL-1beta mRNA level and a sixfold increase in IL-1beta protein in supernatant after 3 h of incubation. c-Fos expression induced by toxin B was reduced dose dependently by IL-1 receptor antagonist (0.1-10 ng/ml). IL-1beta significantly increased c-Fos expression in submucosal neurons compared with the control (34.2 +/- 10.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.3% of NSE neurons). Microejection of toxin B had no effect on the Vm of enteric neurons. Evidence of a direct excitatory effect of IL-1beta on Vm was detected in a minority of enteric neurons. Therefore, toxin B of C. difficile activates VIP-positive submucosal neurons, at least in part, via an indirect IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
TI  - Clostridium bolteae sp. nov., isolated from human sources.
AB  - Seven obligately anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms isolated from human sources were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the strains were genetically highly related to each other (displaying >99% sequence similarity) and represent a previously unknown sub-line within the Clostridium coccoides rRNA group of organisms. Strains of the unidentified bacterium used carbohydrate as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid and lactic acid as the major products of glucose metabolism. The closest described species to the novel bacterium corresponded to Clostridium clostridioforme, although a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of 3% demonstrated they represent different species. Genomic DNA-DNA pairing studies confirmed the separateness of the unknown species and Clostridium clostridioforme. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is therefore proposed that the unknown bacterium, be classified as Clostridium bolteae sp. nov. The type strain of Clostridium bolteae is WAL 16351T (= ATCC(T) = BAA-613T, CCUG(T) = 46953T).
TI  - Clostridium colicanis sp. nov., from canine faeces.
AB  - Morphological, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown, anaerobic, rod-shaped organism isolated from faeces of a canine. The organism was tentatively identified as a member of the genus Clostridium based on its cellular morphology and ability to form endospores but, biochemically, it did not appear to correspond to any recognized species of this genus. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the bacterium represents a previously unrecognized subline within Clostridium rRNA group I (Clostridium sensu stricto), which includes Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus. The nearest phylogenetic relatives of the unknown bacterium corresponded to Clostridium absonum, Clostridium baratii, Eubacterium budayi, Eubacterium moniliforme, Eubacterium multiforme and Eubacterium nitritogenes, but 16S rRNA sequence divergence values of > 3% demonstrated that it represents a novel species. Based on the findings presented, a novel species, Clostridium colicanis sp. nov., is described, with the type strain 3WC2T (=CCUG 44556T =DSM 13634T).
TI  - Butyrivibrio hungatei sp. nov. and Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans sp. nov., butyrate-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  - Two novel Gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, butyrate-producing bacterial species, strains Mz 5T and JK 615T, were isolated from the rumen fluid of cow and sheep. Both strains were curved rods that were motile by means of single polar or subpolar flagellum and common in the rumen microbial ecosystem. Strain Mz 5T produced high xylanase, proteinase, pectin hydrolase and DNase activities; 1,4-beta-endoglucanase was also detected in the culture medium. The bacterium utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. Glucose was fermented to formate, butyrate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. The DNA G + C content was 42.1 mol%. The complete 16S rDNA sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. Strain Mz 5T and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster XIVa and were closely related to Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Butyrivibrio crossotus, Roseburia cecicola and Eubacterium rectale. The name proposed for this novel bacterium is Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is Mz 5T (=DSM 14809T =ATCC BAA-455T). Strain JK 615T produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. Glucose was fermented to formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. The DNA G + C content was 44-8 mol%. The complete 16S rDNA sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. Strain JK 615T was located in clostridial cluster XIVa and was closely related to Clostridium proteoclasticum, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Eubacterium halii. The name proposed for this novel bacterium is Butyrivibrio hungatei; the type strain is JK 615T (=DSM 14810T =ATCC BAA-456T).
TI  - Taxonomy of the glycerol fermenting clostridia and description of Clostridium diolis sp. nov.
AB  - Six Clostridium strains which ferment glycerol to 1,3-propanediol were tested for their taxonomic and phylogenetic relatedness. All but one were known as C butyricum. By physiological tests, 16S rDNA sequences and fatty acid composition two groups were distinguished. The first comprised the strains VPI 3266, DSM 2478 and DSM 523 (C. "kainantoi") and was consistent with the type strain of C. butyricum in almost all characters. The second group comprising the strains DSM 5430, DSM 5431 and E5 was related to C. beijerinckii. The 16S rDNAs of these strains were almost identical with that of the type strain of C. beijerinckii, DSM 791. The DNA-DNA hybridization value of DSM 5431 and ES with C. beijerinckii DSM 791 was markedly but not decisively lower (67 and 72%, respectively). However, there were significant physiological differences to C. beijerinckii which suggested to describe the strains as a separate species, Clostridium diolis with strain SH1 (= DSM 5431) as the type strain. The new species is distinguished from C. beijerinckii, which requires complex nutrients, by its ability to grow in glucose mineral medium with biotin as the only growth factor and by differences in substrate utilization. "C. kainantoi" Takeda and Matsui was recognized as a later synonym of C. butyricum.
TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
TI  - Evaluation of broiler litter with reference to the microbial composition as assessed by using 16S rRNA and functional gene markers.
AB  - Very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. We evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by using a combination of culture and molecular detection. Total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) CFU/g of material. Enteric bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no Salmonella strains were detected by culture. In order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes amplified by PCR with microbial community DNA isolated from poultry litter as the template. From the 16S rDNA library, 31 genera were identified. Twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and Salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. In fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low G+C gram-positive groups. In addition to detection of 16S rDNA sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as Globicatella sulfidofaciens, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Corynebacterium urealyticum, Clostridium aminovalericum, Arthrobacter sp., and Denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. Several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and Bordetella spp. However, specific PCR targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of Salmonella, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., Listeria spp., or toxigenic staphylococci. PCR and DNA hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. Only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.
TI  - [Cloning and DNA sequencing of Bacillus pumilus endo-1,4-beta-glucanase gene].
AB  - Bacillus pumilus S-27 screened from marine environment produces an extracellular  endo-1,4-beta-glucanase. The enzyme has its optimal activity at pH 5.0-7.0 and 55 degrees C and still retained 79.0% of it at pH 9.0. The gene encoded this endo-1,4-beta-glucanase was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene contained an open reading frame of 1980 bp, corresponding to 660 amino acids, the amino acid sequence of this enzyme is very close to that of an EG of C. cellulovorans and an EG of Bacillus sp. KSM-522, all belong to the cellulase family E2.
TI  - A glutamate mutase is involved in the biosynthesis of the lipopeptide antibiotic  friulimicin in Actinoplanes friuliensis.
AB  - Actinoplanes friuliensis produces the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin. This antibiotic is active against gram-positive bacteria such as multiresistant Enterococcus and Staphylococcus strains. It consists of 10 amino acids that form a ring structure and 1 exocyclic amino acid to which an acyl residue is attached. By a reverse genetic approach, biosynthetic genes were identified that are required for the nonribosomal synthesis of the antibiotic. In close proximity two genes (glmA and glmB) were found which are involved in the production of methylaspartate, one of the amino acids of the peptide core. Methylaspartate is synthesized by a glutamate mutase mechanism, which was up to now only described for glutamate fermentation in Clostridium sp. or members of the family ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The active enzyme consists of two subunits, and the corresponding genes overlap each other. To demonstrate enzyme activity in a heterologous host, it was necessary to genetically fuse glmA and glmB. The resulting gene was overexpressed in Streptomyces lividans, and the fusion protein was purified in an active form. For gene disruption mutagenesis, a host-vector system was established which enables genetic manipulation of Actinoplanes spp. for the first time. Thus, targeted inactivation of biosynthetic genes was possible, and their involvement in friulimicin biosynthesis was demonstrated.
TI  - Endocannabinoids induce ileitis in rats via the capsaicin receptor (VR1).
AB  - Intraluminal administration of the endocannabinoids N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) causes inflammation similar to that caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum. The effects of anandamide and 2-AG were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the specific capsaicin receptor (vanilloid receptor subtype 1; VR1) antagonist capsazepine. Pretreatment with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor antagonists N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carbox amide (SR141716) and N-[1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl) -1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR144528) did not affect the responses to anandamide. It has previously been shown that intraluminal toxin A stimulates substance P (SP) release from primary sensory neurons and that pretreatment with SP receptor [neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor] antagonists inhibits the inflammatory effects of toxin A. Anandamide stimulated SP release and this was blocked by capsazepine pretreatment. Also, pretreatment with the specific NK-1 receptor antagonist (2S,3S)-3-([3,5-bis[trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine (L-733,060) significantly inhibited the inflammatory effects of both toxin A and anandamide. Toxin A increased tissue concentrations of anandamide and 2-AG in the ileum, and these effects were enhanced after pretreatment with inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase, a major endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme. The toxin A-stimulated release of anandamide but not 2-AG was selective over their congeners. These results demonstrate that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG stimulate intestinal primary sensory neurons via the capsaicin VR1 receptor to release SP, resulting in enteritis, and that endocannabinoids may mediate the inflammatory effects of toxin A.
TI  - Botulism: a laboratory investigation on biological and food samples from cases and outbreaks in Brazil (1982-2001).
AB  - Laboratory investigation of botulism from 1982 to 2001 confirmed the occurrence of eight positive outbreaks/cases of botulism in Brazil. From those, type A botulism was observed in seven of them. Biological material of one case (serum and feces) was positive in the first step of the bioassay, but the amount of sample was not sufficient for typification. One of the outbreaks that occurred in 2001 was negative for botulinum toxin in samples of serum, gastric washing and feces, collected eight days before the onset of the symptoms in the affected person who was clinically diagnosed as presenting the disease. Other two cases presenting compatible clinical diagnoses presented negative results. However, in those cases, the collection of samples was (1) after antiserum administration or (2) later than eight days of the onset of symptoms. Investigation was performed by mouse bioassay, as described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods (compiled by American Public Health Association--APHA)11, using specific antiserum from Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USA.
TI  - Involvement of tachykinin receptors in Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin-induced plasma extravasation.
AB  - 1 Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin causes dermonecrosis and oedema in the dorsal skin of animals. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of oedema induced by the toxin. 2 The toxin induced plasma extravasation in the dorsal skin of Balb/c mice. 3 The extravasation was significantly inhibited by diphenhydramine, a histamine 1 receptor antagonist. However, the toxin did not cause the release of histamine from mouse mastocytoma cells. 4 Tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonists, [D-Pro(2), D-Trp(7,9)]-SP, [D-Pro(4), D-Trp(7,9)]-SP and spantide, inhibited the toxin-induced leakage in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the non-peptide tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR140333, markedly inhibited the toxin-induced leakage. 5 The leakage induced by the toxin was markedly reduced in capsaicin-pretreated mouse skin but the leakage was not affected by systemic pretreatment with a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist (CGRP(8-37)). 6 The toxin-induced leakage was significantly inhibited by the N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-conotoxin MVIIA, and the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, HOE140 (D-Arg-[Hyp(3), Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin), but was not affected by the selective L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, verapamil, the P-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-agatoxin IVA, tetrodotoxin (TTX), the TTX-resistant Na(+) channel blocker, carbamazepine, or the sensory nerve conduction blocker, lignocaine. 7 These results suggest that plasma extravasation induced by beta-toxin in mouse skin is mediated via a mechanism involving tachykinin NK(1) receptors.
TI  - Glucoamylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum: Sequence studies and analysis of the macromolecular architecture of the enzyme.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment with a length of 2,025 bp, carrying the structural gene coding for glucoamylase in Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, was cloned and sequenced. It coded for 695 amino acids, representing a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 77.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high homologies with the glucoamylase sequence of another bacterial glucoamylase (Clostridium sp. G0005) and with fungal glucoamylases. The catalytic domain (amino acids 271 to 695) of the T. thermosaccharolyticum enzyme shared a high degree of similarity (five conserved regions) with the catalytic domain of Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase. By comparing the secondary structure of the sequence of the catalytic domain of the T. thermosaccharolyticum enzyme with that of glucoamylase from A. awamori, and on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data available for the A. awamori enzyme, it turned out that, most probably, both enzymes have a catalytic domain organized into an "(alpha/alpha)(6)-barrel" and an overall size and shape that is very similar. These findings confirm and extend our working model for the macromolecular architecture of the T. thermosaccharolyticum glucoamylase obtained, in earlier experiments, by electron microscopy of negatively stained isolated enzyme molecules. Antibodies for an enzyme-specific peptide located near the active site were successfully applied for inhibition studies of enzyme activity and for electron microscopic epitope mapping. A study comparing the site of attachment of this kind of antibody to the T. thermosaccharolyticum glucoamylase molecule with the expected attachment site as deduced from the A. awamori enzyme structure confirmed the close similarity of both glucoamylases regarding the macromolecular architecture of that part of the enzyme carrying the catalytic center, though helices H9, H10, and H11 in peripheral parts of the A. awamori enzyme are missing in the T. thermosaccharolyticum enzyme.
TI  - Lotus corniculatus condensed tannins decrease in vivo populations of proteolytic  bacteria and affect nitrogen metabolism in the rumen of sheep.
AB  - Condensed tannins in forage legumes improve the nutrition of sheep by reducing ruminal degradation of plant protein and increasing crude protein flow to the intestine. However, the effects of condensed tannins in forage legumes on rumen bacterial populations in vivo are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of condensed tannins from Lotus corniculatus on four proteolytic rumen bacteria in sheep during and after transition from a ryegrass (Lolium perenne)-white clover (Trifolium repens) diet (i.e., low condensed tannins) to a Lotus corniculatus diet (i.e., higher condensed tannins). The bacterial populations were quantified using a competitive polymerase chain reaction. Lotus corniculatus was fed with or without ruminal infusions of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which binds to and inactivates condensed tannins, enabling the effect of condensed tannins on bacterial populations to be examined. When sheep fed on ryegrass-white clover, populations of Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens C211a, Eubacterium sp. C12b, and Streptococcus bovis B315 were 1.5 x 10(8), 1.1 x 10(6), 4.6 x 10(8), and 7.1 x 10(6) mL(-1), respectively. When the diet was changed to Lotus corniculatus, the average populations (after 8-120 h) of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis decreased (P < 0.001) to 2.4 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(5), 1.1 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(5) mL(-1), respectively. When PEG was infused into the rumen of sheep fed Lotus corniculatus, the populations of C. proteoclasticum, B. fibrisolvens, Eubacterium sp., and S. bovis were higher (P < 0.01-0.001) than in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus without the PEG infusion, with average populations (after 8-120 h) of 4.9 x 10(7), 3.8 x 10(5), 1.9 x 10(8), and 1.0 x 10(6), respectively. Sheep fed the Lotus corniculatus diet had lower rumen proteinase activity, ammonia, and soluble nitrogen (P < 0.05-0.001) than sheep that were fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG. The Lotus corniculatus diet reduced rumen nitrogen digestibility (P < 0.05) and ammonia pool size and increased the flow of undegraded feed nitrogen to the abomasum. The nitrogen intake, rumen non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, rumen microbial non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, and abomasal microbial non-ammonia nitrogen fluxes were similar both in sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus and in sheep fed Lotus corniculatus plus PEG, but nonmicrobial non-ammonia nitrogen flux to the abomasum was higher (P < 0.01) for the sheep fed only Lotus corniculatus. Although condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus reduced the populations of some proteolytic bacteria, total ruminal microbial protein and microbial protein outflow to the abomasum were unchanged, suggesting a species-specific effect of condensed tannins on bacteria in the rumen.
TI  - Development of an operational synaptobrevin-based fluorescent substrate for tetanus neurotoxin quantification.
AB  - Tetanus neurotoxin (TTx), produced by Clostridium tetani, is a two-chain polypeptide with a heavy molecular chain (HC; 100 kDa) and a light molecular chain (LC; 50 kDa) linked by a disulphide bridge. The low-molecular-mass chain is classified as a zinc metalloprotease (EC 3.4.24.68) with specific hydrolysis on synaptobrevin. With the known enzymic activity for the LC of TTx, we developed a quantification method using a quenched fluorescence peptide substrate based on the synaptobrevin sequence (fragments 73-82), suitable for direct determination of the whole TTx (HC+LC) even in crude production batches, without the necessity of purification and reduction steps to isolate the LC of TTx. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was 200 nmol/min and it was totally inhibited by EDTA, anti-recombinant fragment C antibody, and the cleavage was in a single bond (Gln-Phe) with purified and crude TTx. Besides, ELISA applied to the anti-TTx serum produced at our Institute showed cross-reaction with every fraction of the crude TTx extract. Another aspect is that TTx activity depends on the storage time, reaching a maximum on day 10. The results obtained suggest that the use of the new fluorescent substrate, Abz-synaptobrevin(73-82)-EDDnp, enables easy and quick determination of TTx. It is a good alternative to some of the existing methods such as flocculation assay, and it can replace, under some conditions, the biological assays (minimal mortal dose).
TI  - Recognition and hydrolysis of noncrystalline cellulose.
AB  - Cellulase Cel5A from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1139 contains a family 17 carbohydrate-binding module (BspCBM17) and a family 28 CBM (BspCBM28) in tandem. The two modules have significantly similar amino acid sequences, but amino acid residues essential for binding are not conserved. BspCBM28 was obtained as a discrete polypeptide by engineering the cel5A gene. BspCBM17 could not be obtained as a discrete polypeptide, so a family 17 CBM from endoglucanase Cel5A of Clostridium cellulovorans, CcCBM17, was used to compare the binding characteristics of the two families of CBM. Both CcCBM17 and BspCBM28 recognized two classes of binding sites on amorphous cellulose: a high affinity site (K(a) approximately 1 x 10(6) M(-1)) and a low affinity site (K(a) approximately 2 x 10(4) M(-1)). They did not compete for binding to the high affinity sites, suggesting that they bound at different sites on the cellulose. A polypeptide, BspCBM17/CBM28, comprising the tandem CBMs from Cel5A, bound to amorphous cellulose with a significantly higher affinity than the sum of the affinities of CcCBM17 and BspCBM28, indicating cooperativity between the linked CBMs. Cel5A mutants were constructed that were defective in one or both of the CBMs. The mutants differed from the wild-type enzyme in the amounts and sizes of the soluble products produced from amorphous cellulose. This suggests that either the CBMs can modify the action of the catalytic module of Cel5A or that they target the enzyme to areas of the cellulose that differ in susceptibility to hydrolysis.
TI  - Structural microdomains in the lateral plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair cells.
AB  - The basal and lateral regions of the plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair cells are structurally and functionally distinct. The lateral region contains thousands of motor proteins but few voltage-gated channels. The basal region, conversely, contains a high number of voltage-gated channels but is devoid of motor proteins. It has been suggested that the cortical cytoskeleton is responsible for maintaining this regional distinction. Toward elucidating the structure of the outer hair cell's electromotile mechanism, we investigated the physical organization of the lateral plasma membrane in living guinea pig outer hair cells by analyzing the distribution pattern of the anionic long-chain carbocyanine SP-DiIC18(3) within this area, before and after electrical stimulation and with an intact and a disrupted cytoskeleton. We observed punctate, intensely fluorescent patches as well as areas of weaker fluorescence, with clear local maxima and minima, upon labeling the cells with this membrane-soluble probe. This discrete distribution of SP-DilC18(3) suggests that the lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells may be composed of small structural domains (microdomains). Disrupting the cytoskeleton with either trypsin or toxin B from Clostridium difficile did not change this pattern of distribution, thus indicating that this treatment did not facilitate the lateral diffusion of the probes. Electrical stimulation using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, on the other hand, induced two responses: fast motility and reversible displacement of the fluorescent probes. Both responses were inhibited by internal perfusion with salicylate, while disruption of the cytoskeleton did not inhibit OHC fast motility but affected the electrically induced redistribution of fluorescent probes. Together, these results suggest that the lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells contains structural microdomains and that the cytoskeleton does not appear to be playing a major role in maintaining the lateral separation of these distinct molecular regions.
TI  - Thermovenabulum ferriorganovorum gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel thermophilic, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacterium.
AB  - A thermophilic, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium (strain Z-9801T) was isolated  from a terrestrial hydrothermal source in the Uzon caldera on the Kamchatka peninsula. Cells of strain Z-9801T were straight, sometimes branched rods, 0.5-0.6 microm in diameter and 1.5-7.0 microm in length, with peritrichous flagella. The temperature range for growth was 45-76 degrees C, with an optimum at 63-65 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 4.8-8.2, with an optimum at 6.7-6.9. The substrates utilized by strain Z-9801T included peptone, yeast extract, beef extract, Casamino acids, starch, pyruvate, melibiose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, xylose and ribose. The fermentation products from melibiose were ethanol, acetate, H2 and CO2. Strain Z-9801T used H2 in the presence of Fe(III) and an organic electron donor. Strain Z-9801T reduced Fe(III), Mn(IV), nitrate, fumarate, sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and 9,10-anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate. The G+C content of strain Z-9801T DNA was 36 mol%. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolated organism forms a separate branch within the Bacillus/Clostridium group. On the basis of physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain Z-9801T (= DSM 14006T = UNIQEM 210T) should be assigned to a novel species of a new genus, Thermovenabulum ferriorganovorum gen. nov., sp. nov.
TI  - Caminicella sporogenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel thermophilic spore-forming bacterium isolated from an East-Pacific Rise hydrothermal vent.
AB  - A novel thermophilic, anaerobic, strictly chemoorganoheterotrophic bacterium, designated as AM1114T, was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent sample from the East-Pacific Rise (EPR 13 degrees N). The cells were long (3-10 microm) rods, motile with peritrichous flagella, and exhibited a gram-negative cell wall ultrastructure. In the late stationary phase of growth, cells formed an ovoid, refractile, terminal endospore. They grew at 45-65 degrees C inclusive (optimum 55-60 degrees C; doubling time approx. 45 min), at pH 4.5-8.0 inclusive (optimum pH 7.5-8.0) and at sea salt concentrations of 20-60 g l(-1) inclusive (optimum 25-30 g l(-1)). Strain AM1114T was an obligately heterotrophic bacterium able to ferment a mixture of 20 amino acids, complex proteinaceous substrates (such as yeast extract, brain-heart infusion or peptone), and carbohydrates such as glucose, galactose or maltose. The main fermentation products on glucose/yeast extract/peptone/sulfur medium were hydrogen, carbon dioxide, butyrate, ethanol, acetate, formate and L-alanine. The G+C content of the genomic DNA (determined by thermal denaturation) was 24.2+/-1 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene located the strain within cluster XI of the lineage encompassing the genus Clostridium and related genera (sensu Collins et al., 1994), in the bacterial domain. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence comparisons and physiological and biochemical characteristics, it is proposed that the isolate should be described as a novel genus, namely Caminicella gen. nov., of which Caminicella sporogenes sp. nov. is the type species. The type strain is AM1114T (= DSM 14501T = CIP 107141T).
TI  - Roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  - Five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. These strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. The DNA G + C content of the strains was 29-31 mol%. A detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel species of anaerobic, low-G+C-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium oxidoreducens and Roseburia cecicola, members of cluster XIVa of the Clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. It is proposed that a novel species, Roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain L1-82T (= DSM 14610T = NCIMB 13810T) as the type strain.
TI  - Shuttleworthia satelles gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Nine strains of anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the human oral cavity and provisionally identified as belonging to the genus Eubacterium, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genetic tests. Biochemically, they were found to comprise a homogeneous group, and phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA sequences indicated that they constitute a unique branch within the Clostridium-Bacillus subphylum of the phylum Firmicutes. All of the isolates displayed an unusual colonial morphology after extended incubation. This resembled a contaminated culture in that small, secondary colonies were seen to arise around and from within the primary colony form, and a third, independent, colony type was also seen. However, inspection of the colonies by Gram-staining and scanning electron microscopy together with protein profile analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison of the two independent colony types revealed that only a single organism was present. A new genus, Shuttleworthia, and the species Shuttleworthia satelles gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. The cells are saccharolytic, and acetate, butyrate and lactate are produced as end products of glucose fermentation. Aesculin is hydrolysed and indole is produced. The G+C content of the DNA of the type strain is 51 mol%. The type strain is strain DSM 14600T (= CCUG 45864T = VPI D143K-13T).
TI  - Clostridium thiosulfatireducens sp. nov., a proteolytic, thiosulfate- and sulfur-reducing bacterium isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, sporulating rod (0.5-0.6 x 2.0-4.0 microm),  designated strain Lup 21T, was isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating cheese-factory wastewater. Strain Lup 21T was motile by means of peritrichous flagella, had a G+C content of 31.4 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, in the absence of NaCl. It is a heterotrophic micro-organism, utilizing proteinaceous compounds (gelatin, peptides, Casamino acids and various single amino acids) but unable to use any of the carbohydrates tested as a carbon and energy source. It reduced thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfide in the presence of Casamino acids as carbon and energy sources. Acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, CO2 and sulfide were end products from oxidation of gelatin and Casamino acids in the presence of thiosulfate as an electron acceptor. In the absence of thiosulfate, serine, lysine, methionine and histidine were fermented. On the basis of 16S rRNA similarity, strain Lup 21T was related to members of the low-G+C Clostridiales group, Clostridium subterminale DSM 6970T being the closest relative (with a sequence similarity of 99.4%). DNA-DNA hybridization was 56% with this species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the isolate was designated as a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium thiosulfatireducens sp. nov. The type strain is strain Lup 21T (= DSM 13105T = CIP 106908T).
TI  - Ruminococcus luti sp. nov., isolated from a human faecal sample.
AB  - A strain of an unidentified strictly anoxic, gram-postive, non-motile Ruminococcus-like bacterium was isolated from a human faecal sample. The organism used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced acetate, succinate, and hydrogen as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a G + C content of 43.3 mol%. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the organism were consistent with its assignment to the genus Ruminococcus but it did not correspond to any recognized species of this genus. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed the unidentified bacterium represents a previously unrecognised sub-line within the Clostridium coccoides rRNA group of organisms. The nearest relative of the unknown bacterium corresponded to Ruminococcus obeum but a 16S rRNA sequence divergence value of >3% demonstrated it represents a different species. Based on the presented findings a new species, Ruminococcus luti, is described. The type strain of Ruminococcus luti is BInIX(T) (DSM 14534T, CCUG 45635T).
TI  - Enteric coronavirus infection in a juvenile dromedary (Camelus dromedarius).
AB  - A case of an enteric coronavirus infection in a 6-week-old dromedary calf is described. The animal had diarrhea for 5 days and died despite symptomatic treatment. Numerous viral particles, approximately 140 nm in diameter, with club-like projections were detected in the feces by electron microscopy. These characteristics were consistent with a coronavirus. Immunohistochemical reactivity with 2 antigenic group II coronavirus-specific antibodies confirmed the presence of viral antigen in colonic epithelial cells. The death of the animal was attributed to a neutrophilic and emphysematous colitis that likely was caused by an infection with a Clostridium sp.
TI  - [Combination use of kampo-medicines and drugs affecting intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The intestinal bacteria, Eubacterium sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., participate in  the metabolism of active kampo-ingredients, glycyrrhizin (GL), sennoside (SEN) and baicalin (BL). Since antibiotics and bacterial preparations, Bifidobacterium longum (LAC-B), Clostridium butyricum (MIYA-BM), and Streptococcus faecalis (BIOFERMIN), affect the bacterial population in intestinal bacterial flora, metabolism of the active kampo-ingredients in the bacterial flora may be altered by their combined administration. We investigated 1199 prescriptions including kampo-medicines for 308 patients. Combination use of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations occurred with 7% and 10% of the kampo-prescription, respectively. Most antibiotics have activity against intestinal bacteria, except that cephems and macrolides are not active against to E. coli. This means that antibiotics may lower the metabolism of GL, SEN and BL when administered in combination. On the other hand, it is also highly possible that bacterial preparations increase the number of Eubacterium sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., resulting in enhanced metabolism of GL and SEN when they are used concomitantly with kampo-medicines. The present results suggested that the drug interactions of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations should be confirmed in clinical studies.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of South Africa.
AB  - The present study covered two rural communities of South Africa: Ncera and Ntselamanzi villages. Raw water from Ncera river is used by the community of Ncera village for drinking, while the community of Ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from Alice purification system. Treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. In rural communities of South Africa, many households use polyethylene (PE) and galvanized steel (GS) containers for the storage of their drinking water. To investigate the regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, PE and GS slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. This period of 48 h was chosen as the study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. The experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by rural communities. No disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. Attached coliphages (F-RNA (FP) and somatic phage (SP), coliform bacteria (total coliform (TC), presumptive Escherichia coli (EC), Salmonella (Sal) and Clostridium perfringens (CP) were measured during the study period. With the exception of CP, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of TC, presumptive E. coli and Salmonella, somatic and F-RNA coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (EC: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), Sal: < 1-15 cfu cm(-2), FP: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), SP: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of TC (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). However, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive E. coli. Whereas the occurrence and survival of TC was noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. The regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. This length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of TC (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. A comparison between PE and GS containers showed that more TC (average count) regrew on PE than on GS containers (for river water, PE: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), GS: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, PE: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), GS from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). This study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. The storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of TC. Nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel glucocerebrosidase of Paenibacillus sp. TS12.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase [EC 3.2.1.45] from Paenibacillus sp. TS12. The open reading frame of the glucocerebrosidase gene consisted of 2,493 bp nucleotides and encoded 831 amino acid residues. The enzyme exhibited no sequence similarity with a classical glucocerebrosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 30, but rather showed significant similarity with GH family 3 beta-glucosidases from Clostridium thermocellum, Ruminococcus albus, and Aspergillus aculeateus. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, had a molecular weight of 90.7 kDa and hydrolyzed NBD-labeled glucosylceramide, but not galactosylceramide, GM1a or sphingomyelin. The enzyme was most active at pH 6.5, and its apparent Km and Vmax values for NBD-labeled glucosylceramide and p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside were 223 microM and 1.60 micromol/min/mg of protein, and 593 microM and 112 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Asp-223 is an essential amino acid for the catalytic reaction and possibly functions a catalytic nucleophile, as in GH family 3 beta-glucosidases. This is the first report of the molecular cloning and characterization of a glucocerebrosidase from a procaryote.
TI  - [Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection].
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC), antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), and colitis (AAC) caused by Clostridium difficile are recognized as complications of antibiotic treatment (cephalosporins, penicillins, clindamycin and others). Two groups are particularly at risk: older and immunocompromised patients. In recent years C. difficile has been recognized as a common nosocomial pathogen. To understand the epidemiology of the C. difficile infection, many outbreaks have been investigated by various methods. In the paper we reviewed different methods of C. difficile typing and discussed the epidemiology of C. difficile-associated infections in light of recent publications.
TI  - Sporanaerobacter acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel acetogenic, facultatively sulfur-reducing bacterium.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, sporulating rod, designated strain Lup 33T, was isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor in Mexico. Strain Lup 33T possessed a few laterally inserted flagella, had a DNA G+C content of 32.2 mol % and grew optimally at pH 7.4 and 40 degrees C. Growth was observed at temperatures of up to 50 degrees C and was inhibited in the presence of 5% NaCl. Strain Lup 33T is heterotrophic and utilized some sugars, peptides and various single amino acids. Gelatin and casein were not used as energy sources. It performed the Stickland reaction and reduced elemental sulfur to sulfide. Acetate was the only fatty acid detected from glucose fermentation, whereas acetate together with isobutyrate and isovalerate were found as end products from peptone fermentation. Phylogenetically, strain Lup 33T branched with members of cluster XII of the order Clostridiales, with Clostridium hastiforme as the closest relative (similarity of 93%). On the basis of the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolate, it is proposed as a novel species of a new genus, Sporanaerobacter acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is strain Lup 33T (= DSM 13106T = CIP 106730T).
TI  - Caloramator viterbensis sp. nov., a novel thermophilic, glycerol-fermenting bacterium isolated from a hot spring in Italy.
AB  - A moderately thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium, strain JW/MS-VS5T, was isolated from a mixed sediment/water sample of a hot spring at Bagnaccio (near Viterbo, Italy). The cells of this organism were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4-0.6 x 2.03.0 microm in dimension. Cells occurred singly and stained Gram-positive. The temperature range for growth at pH(25C) 6.0 was 33-64 degrees C, the optimum being 58 degrees C. The pH(25C) range for growth was from 5.0 to 7.8, the optimum being 6.0-6.5. The substrates utilized included glycerol, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, cellobiose, lactose, starch and yeast extract. Acetate and 1,3-propanediol were the only detectable organic products of glycerol fermentation; significant amounts of H2 were produced during growth. The strain was unable to grow autotrophically in the presence of H2 and CO2. The main products of glucose fermentation were CO2, H2, acetate and ethanol. Single amino acids, including serine, glutamine, threonine, leucine, methionine, aspartate, valine and histidine (but not arginine), served as carbon sources. Growth was completely inhibited by ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, rifampicin and kanamycin at 100 microg ml(-1) and was retarded by streptomycin and tetracycline. The G+C content of the DNA was 32 mol% (HPLC). According to 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the isolate is located within the Gram-type positive Bacillus-Clostridium branch of the phylogenetic tree. On the basis of physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain JW/MS-VS5T (the only, and type, strain) (= DSM 13723T = ATCC PTA 584T), constitutes the new species Caloramator viterbensis.
TI  - Clostridium phytofermentans sp. nov., a cellulolytic mesophile from forest soil.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain ISDgT, was isolated from forest soil. Cells of this isolate stained Gram-negative, despite possessing a Gram-positive cell-wall ultrastructure, and were motile, straight rods that formed spherical terminal spores that swelled the sporangium. Cellulose, pectin, polygalacturonic acid, starch, xylan, arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, galactose, gentiobiose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, ribose and xylose supported growth. The major end products of fermentation were ethanol, acetate, CO2 and H2; formate and lactate were minor products. The optimum temperature for growth was 35-37 degrees C. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA sequence comparisons showed that strain ISDgT was related to a group of anaerobes that included Clostridium herbivorans, Clostridium polysaccharolyticum and Clostridium populeti. The G+C content of this strain was 35.9 mol%. On the basis of numerous genotypic and phenotypic differences between strain ISDgT and its close relatives, strain ISDgT is proposed as a novel species in the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium phytofermentans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ISDgT (= ATCC 700394T).
TI  - Mechanism of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum beta-xylosidase: kinetic studies.
AB  - The catalytic mechanism of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum beta-xylosidase  (XynB) from family 39 of glycoside hydrolases has been subjected to a detailed kinetic investigation using a range of substrates. The enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH dependence of k(cat)/K(m), reflecting apparent pK(a) values of 4.1 and 6.8. The k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) values for a series of aryl xylosides have been measured and used to construct two Bronsted plots. The plot of log(k(cat)/K(m)) against the pK(a) of the leaving group reveals a significant correlation (beta(lg) = -0.97, r(2) = 0.94, n = 8), indicating that fission of the glycosidic bond is significantly advanced in the transition state leading to the formation of the xylosyl-enzyme intermediate. The large negative value of the slope indicates that there is relatively little proton donation to the glycosidic oxygen in the transition state. A biphasic, concave-downward plot of log(k(cat)) against pK(a) provides good evidence for a two-step double-displacement mechanism involving a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. For activated leaving groups (pK(a) < 9), the breakdown of the xylosyl-enzyme intermediate is the rate-determining step, as indicated by the absence of any effect of the pK(a) of the leaving group on log(k(cat)) (beta(lg) approximately 0). However, a strong dependence of the first-order rate constant on the pK(a) value of relatively poor leaving groups (pK(a) > 9) suggests that the xylosylation step is rate-determining for these substrates. Support for the dexylosylation chemical step being rate-determining for activated substrates comes from nucleophilic competition experiments in which addition of dithiothreitol results in an increase in turnover rates. Normal secondary alpha-deuterium kinetic isotope effects ((alpha-D)(V) or (alpha-D)(V/K) = 1.08-1.10) for three different substrates of widely varying pK(a) value (5.15-9.95) have been measured and these reveal that the transition states leading to the formation and breakdown of the intermediate are similar and both steps involve rehybridization of C1 from sp(3) to sp(2). These results are consistent only with "exploded" transition states, in which the saccharide moiety bears considerable positive charge, and the intermediate is a covalent acylal-ester where C1 is sp(3) hybridized.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in Latin American patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (ReA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the 16S ribosomal RNA-PCR method was used to identify bacterial DNA in synovial fluid (SF) and tissue (ST) in a well defined group of patients with chronic ReA. In addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. METHODS: We examined 15 ST and 5 SF samples of 15 patients with ReA, 5 ST samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and 8 SF from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested PCR with universal 16S rRNA primers. In addition, a nested PCR was developed to detect DNA sequences of Salmonella sp. and Mycoplasma sp. Automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (GenBank) were also performed to identify the species. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was identified in 8 cases, 5 ST and 3 SF; Chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), Pseudomonas sp. (n = 3), and Bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. A variety of microorganisms including Clostridium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Pseudomonas migulae, P. fluorescens, and P. putida, and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B were also identified. In half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3 bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA is present in the joints in patients with chronic ReA. A wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with ReA were identified. Further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of ReA and related arthritides.
TI  - Clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp., Clostridium sp., and Fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. The strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. Predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. Organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. When anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. The early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  - Tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea Tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. It is endemic in many countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. Although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. We conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in Fortaleza, capital of Ceara State (Northeast Brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. Swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. The most common species were Staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). Bacillus sp., Enteroccous faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. Eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we detected Peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases Clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. These results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. It is proposed that T. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. To prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.
TI  - Anaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising,  butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  - Two strains of a previously undescribed Eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated  from human faeces. The strains are Gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. The two isolates displayed 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from Eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the Clostridium coccoides group of organisms. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, Anaerostipes caccae. The type strain of Anaerostipes caccae is NCIMB 13811T (= DSM 14662T).
TI  - Isolation of an anaerobic intestinal bacterium capable of cleaving the C-ring of  the isoflavonoid daidzein.
AB  - Colonic bacteria were screened for bacteria involved in the conversion of phytoestrogens. A gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, strain HGH 136, capable of conversion of the isoflavonoid daidzein, was isolated and identified as a Clostridium sp. The bacterium cleaved the C-ring of daidzein to produce O-demethylangolensin ( O-Dma). This compound was identified by comparison of the HPLC retention time and UV spectrum of the metabolite with chemically synthesized O-Dma. The identity of the metabolite was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR using synthetic O-Dma as a standard. The bacterium incubated with synthetic dihydrodaidzein also produced O-Dma. After 3 days of incubation, 28% of added daidzein and 12% of added dihydrodaidzein were converted to O-Dma. This is the first study in which an anaerobic bacterium involved in the ring cleavage of daidzein to produce O-Dma has been identified.
TI  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. METHODS: After ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). Quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were performed. RESULTS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. Pouch Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. Total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. There were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. Not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. They are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. Total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. Levels of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. Because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.
TI  - Clostridium lactatifermen tans sp. nov., a lactate-fermenting anaerobe isolated from the caeca of a chicken.
AB  - An obligately anaerobic, lactate-fermenting bacterium (strain G17T) was isolated  from the caeca of a 31-day-old chicken. Grown at neutral pH, cells were rod-shaped with tapered ends and showed no motility and no spore formation. Electron microscopy showed that the cell walls had a gram-positive structure. The DNA G+C content was 44.6 mol %. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, strain G17T was considered to belong to the low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria of cluster XIV subgroup b and most closely related to Clostridium propionicum (93.5%) and Clostridium neopropionicum (93.5%). The optimum temperature for growth was 41 degrees C and the optimum pH was pH 6.4-7.3. The optimum temperature of 41 degrees C suggests that strain G17T might have become adapted to the body temperature of chickens. Strain G17T was able to grow on a variety of organic compounds. Most of these compounds were converted to acetate, propionate and traces of butyrate and isovalerate. In media with mixtures of substrates, lactate was degraded by strain G17T before the other substrates. This indicates that strain G17T might be important in the fermentation of lactate in the caeca of chickens. Based on its physiological and phylogenetic characteristics, it is proposed that strain G17T should be assigned to the genus Clostridium as a novel species, Clostridium lactatifermentans sp. nov.
TI  - Reclassification of Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum as Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus gen. nov., comb. nov., and description of Sedimentibacter saalensis sp. nov..
AB  - Strain ZF2T, isolated from freshwater sediment, is a motile, rod-shaped, gram-positive, endospore-forming, amino acid- and pyruvate-utilizing, anaerobic bacterium. It requires yeast extract for growth. Carbohydrates are not utilized. The optimal temperature and pH for growth are 37 degrees C and 6.8-7.3, respectively. The G+C content of the DNA is 34.0 mol %. A 16S rDNA sequence analysis of strain ZF2T revealed that the highest similarity (94.4%) was shared with Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum JW/Z-1T. Strain ZF2T, however, was not able to carboxylate phenol or to decarboxylate 4-hydroxybenzoate, which are characteristic properties of strain JW/Z-1T. The degree of 16S rDNA relatedness, together with the physiological and chemotaxonomic properties, suggest that strain ZF2T represents a novel species that is clearly distinct from Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum JW/Z-1T. In a phylogenetic dendrogram, both strains form a separate cluster that is peripherally associated with the Peptostreptococcus group (cluster XIII) of the clostridia and the lineage of Helcococcus kunzii. Strains ZF2T and JW/Z-1T show a somewhat deeper branching from the cluster XII clostridia Clostridium purinolyticum and Clostridium acidiurici. The latter strains possessed the closest 16S rDNA similarity (between 88.4 and 90.7%), but were clearly separated by phenotypic markers. Therefore, a new genus, Sedimentibacter gen. nov., is described, comprising Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus gen. nov., comb. nov., as the type species of the genus, with JW/Z-1T (= ATCC 51151T = DSM 7310T) as the type strain, and the novel species Sedimentibacter saalensis sp. nov., with strain ZF2T (= DSM 13558T = ATCC BAA-283T) as the type strain.
TI  - Stopped-Flow Kinetics of Methyl Group Transfer between the Corrinoid-Iron-Sulfur  Protein and Acetyl-Coenzyme A Synthase from Clostridium thermoaceticum.
AB  - Kinetics of methyl group transfer between the Ni-Fe-S-containing acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) and the corrinoid protein (CoFeSP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum were investigated using the stopped-flow method at 390 nm. Rates of the reaction CH(3)-Co(3+)FeSP + ACS(red) <==> Co(1+)FeSP + CH(3)-ACS(ox) in both forward and reverse directions were determined using various protein and reductant concentrations. Ti(3+)citrate, dithionite, and CO were used to reductively activate ACS (forming ACS(red)). The simplest mechanism that adequately fit the data involved formation of a [CH(3)-Co(3+)FeSP]:[ACS(red)] complex, methyl group transfer (forming [Co(1+)FeSP]:[CH(3)-ACS(ox)]), product dissociation (forming Co(1+)FeSP + CH(3)-ACS(ox)), and CO binding yielding a nonproductive enzyme state (ACS(red) + CO <==> ACS(red)-CO). Best-fit rate constants were obtained. CO inhibited methyl group transfer by binding ACS(red) in accordance with K(D) = 180 +/- 90 microM. Fits were unimproved when >1 CO was assumed to bind. Ti(3+)citrate and dithionite inhibited the reverse methyl group transfer reaction, probably by reducing the D-site of CH(3)-ACS(ox). This redox site is oxidized by 2e(-) when the methyl cation is transferred from CH(3)-Co(3+)FeSP to ACS(red), and is reduced during the reverse reaction. Best-fit K(D) values for pre- and post-methyl-transfer complexes were 0.12 +/- 0.06 and 0.3 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively. Intracomplex methyl group transfer was reversible with K(eq) = 2.3 +/- 0.9 (k(f)/k(r) = 6.9 s(-1)/3.0 s(-1)). The nucleophilicity of the [Ni(2+)D(red)] unit appears comparable to that of Co(1+) cobalamins. Reduction of the D-site may cause the Ni(2+) of the A-cluster to behave like the Ni of an organometallic Ni(0) complex.
TI  - [The use of the toxin binding inhibition test for potency testing of Clostridium  novyi type B alpha toxoid vaccines].
AB  - The toxin binding inhibition test (ToBI) were developed for potency testing of C. novyi type B alpha toxoid containing veterinary vaccines to replace the currently used toxin neutralisation test in mice (TNT). The antitoxin titres of rabbit sera (AN-, HV- and SP sera) were determined with ToBI using the international reference serum with known antitoxin titre. In order to show the validity of the methods, the results were compared with those of the manufacturers/regulatory authorities and correlation coefficients were calculated. The correlation coefficients were r = 0.93 (AN sera), r = 0.73 (HV sera) and r = 0.85 (SP sera). All correlations were statistically significant. The specificity of the methods could be proved using heterologous antisera. The results of the ToBI were reproducible. Thus, the ToBI offers a suitable in vitro method for the determination of the antitoxin titre of rabbit antisera as an alternative to the toxin neutralisation in mice for potency testing of vaccines containing C. novyi type B alpha toxoid.
TI  - Evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587.
AB  - All publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 in order to reveal the capability of microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. Among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cphA were found in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (encoding a protein homologous to CphA with 40% amino acid identity), Bordetella bronchiseptica strain RB50 (39%), Bordetella pertussis strain Tohama I (39%), Bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), Clostridium botulinum strain ATCC 3502 (39%), Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain DCB-2 (38%) and Nitrosomonas europaea strain ATCC 25978 (37%). The gene homologous to cphA from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 was amplified by PCR, ligated to the vector pBluescript SK(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into Escherichia coli. The recombinant strain of E. coli expressed CphA activity at up to 1.2 U/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that CphA of Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 is functionally active. In Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as a storage compound in this strain.
TI  - Co-processing of organic fraction of municipal solid waste and primary sludge--stabilization and disinfection.
AB  - Batch mesophilic digesters were fed a mixture of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OF-MSW) and primary sludge (PS), and operated under non-mixing condition at a 30-day influent mass retention time. The reactors were started in a slurry mode and brought to the target level of 26-30% total solids in about 3 months from start. Two feed characteristics, the level of PS solids in the feed, and the particle size of the OF-MSW, were the variables used to determine their effect on methane production during digester operation. Higher biodegradable volatile solid reductions and methane yields matched increased fractions of primary sludge in the feed (5%, 10%, and 15% as dry solids). Incomplete digestion, limited to fermentation, took place in reactors that did not receive primary sludge. The particle size did not have any effect on specific weight of the feed but the amount of primary sludge did. Addition of vitamins and micronutrients to the inhibited reactors did not stimulate methane production, which narrowed the range of possible causes to the lack of available macronutrients, namely nitrogen. On the other hand, possible un-ionized ammonia (NH3) inhibition of reactors fed with the highest primary sludge-amended feed hindered organic conversion rates. Elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from the high-solids residue via long-term storage, followed by low-dose lime disinfection, was also investigated. Storage alone reduced fecal coliform and Salmonella sp. bacteria to below detection, but bacterial spores of anaerobic Clostridium perfringens survived. Subsequent liming of the residue caused irreversible inactivation of the spores because of high pH and, possibly, free ammonia (NH3) inherent to sludge.
TI  - Reclassification of Eubacterium formicigenerans Holdeman and Moore 1974 as Dorea  formicigenerans gen. nov., comb. nov., and description of Dorea longicatena sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Two strains of a gram-positively staining, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strains 111-13A and 111-35T, were isolated from human faeces. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains were members of the Clostridium coccoides rRNA group of organisms. The nearest relatives of the unknown bacterium were Eubacterium formicigenerans (having a sequence similarity of 94%) and an uncultured bacterium (similarity > 99%). Characterization studies indicated that the unidentified faecal bacterium was biochemically distinct from Eubacterium formicigenerans, members of the Clostridium coccoides group and all other described Eubacterium species. On the basis of the data from these studies, it is proposed that the hitherto unknown rod-shaped bacterium be designated a species of a novel genus, namely Dorea longicatena gen. nov., sp. nov., and that Eubacterium formicigenerans be transferred to this genus as Dorea formicigenerans gen. nov., comb. nov.
TI  - [The growth-promoting effect of Beijerinckia and Clostridium sp. cultures on some agricultural crops].
AB  - New strains of Beijerinckia mobilis and Clostridium sp. isolated from the pea rhizosphere were studied with respect to their promoting effect on the growth and development of some agricultural crops. Seed soaking in bacterial suspensions followed by the soil application of the suspensions or their application by means of foliar spraying was found to be the most efficient method of bacterization. The application of B. mobilis and Clostridium sp. cultures in combination with mineral fertilizers increased the crop production by 1.5-2.5 times. The study of the population dynamics of B. mobilis by the method of genetic marking showed that this bacterium quickly colonized the rhizoplane of plants and, therefore, had characteristics of an r-strategist. At the same time, Clostridium sp. was closer to K-strategists, since this bacterium slowly colonized the econiches studied. The introduction of the bacteria into soil did not affect the indigenous soil bacterial complex. The presence of Clostridium sp. slowed down the colonization of roots by the fungal mycelium. The possible mechanisms of the plant growth-promoting activity of B. mobilis and Clostridium sp. are discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against 469 less frequently identified anaerobes isolated from human infections.
AB  - We studied the in vitro activity of ertapenem against 469 less frequently identified anaerobes from 11 genera and 52 species isolated from human infections. Ertapenem was uniformly active against 460 of 469 (98%) strains at concentrations of < or = 4 microg/ml. Only 4 of 14 Clostridium difficile, 1 of 11 Clostridium innocuum, and 4 of 6 Lactobacillus sp. strains required ertapenem concentrations of > or = 8 microg/ml for inhibition.
TI  - Clostridium hathewayi sp. nov., from human faeces.
AB  - A strictly anoxic, Gram-positive, sporeforming, rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a chemostat inoculated with human faeces. The bacterium used carbohydrate as fermentable substrates, producing acetate, ethanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a G + C content of 50.7 to 50.9 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the unidentified bacterium represents a previously unrecognised sub-line within the Clostridium coccoides rRNA group of organisms. The nearest relatives of the unknown bacterium corresponded to Clostridium algidixylanolyticum, C. aerotolerans, C. celerecrescens, C. indolis, C. sphenoides, C. methoxybenzovorans and C. xylanolyticum but 16S rRNA sequence divergence values of >4% demonstrated that it represents a novel species. Based on the presented findings a new species, Clostridium hathewayi, is described. The type strain of Clostridium hathewayi is DSM = 13479T (= CCUG 43506 T).
TI  - New solvent-producing Clostridium sp. strains, hydrolyzing a wide range of polysaccharides, are closely related to Clostridium butyricum.
AB  - Thirteen new Clostridium strains, previously isolated from soil and found to produce high amounts of solvents from glucose, hydrolyzed a great variety of alpha- and beta-glycans, including raw starch, xylan, pectin, inulin and cellulose. The sequences of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing the variable 3' part of one of the 16S rRNA genes were 99.5% identical. The macrorestriction pattern of two endonucleolytic digests of chromosomal DNA in the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) confirmed their high homogeneity on the DNA level. The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of three selected strains was 99.8% identical to the 16S rRNA gene sequence from Clostridium butyricum and separates them from C. acetobutylicum. To the closely related four species of solventogenic clostridia a new group of strains has to be added, which has a great potential for the direct fermentation of biomass.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect anaerobic bacteria Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of Bacteroides fragilis. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to identify the Clostridium sp. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequences for Clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). The two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using SSPC analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. PCR is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which are difficult to culture. SSCP of PCR products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.
TI  - 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens.
AB  - The microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. Earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a survey of cecal bacteria was done by retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. The ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in TTGE gels. A total of 1,656 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in the GenBank. The comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. Overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (Clostridium leptum, Sporomusa sp., Clostridium coccoides, and enterics). Sequences of members of the Bacteroides group, the Bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of Pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. Sequences related to those from the Escherichia sp. subgroup and from Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited in the GenBank. Sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. TTGE and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.
TI  - Emended descriptions of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium beijerinckii,  and descriptions of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum sp. nov. and Clostridium saccharobutylicum sp. nov.
AB  - On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA reassociation, industrial solvent-producing clostridia have been assigned to four species. In this study, the phenotypic characteristics of Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, 'Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum', and an unnamed Clostridium sp. represented by the strains NCP 262T and NRRL B643 are compared. In addition, a further 40 strains of solvent-producing clostridia have been classified by biotyping, DNA fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These included 14 C. beijerinckii strains, two strains currently designated as 'Clostridium kaneboi' and 'Clostridium butanologenum', and 24 production strains used in the commercial acetone-butanol fermentation. All of the C. beijerinckii strains were confirmed to have been classified correctly. The 'C. kaneboi' and 'C. butanologenum' strains require reclassification as C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii, respectively. The commercial production strains were found to belong either to C. beijerinckii or to the unnamed Clostridium sp. For the comparative phenotypic studies of the four species, representative strains were selected from each of the DNA-fingerprint subgroups within each species. These strains were analysed for their ability to utilize different carbohydrates, hydrolyse gelatin or aesculin, and produce indole, and were tested for the presence of catalase and urease. On the basis of these results, several phenotypic traits were found to be useful for differentiating between the four species. The descriptions of C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii have been emended. The names Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum sp. nov. [type strain = N1-4 (HMT) = ATCC 27021T] and Clostridium saccharobutylicum sp. nov. (type strain = DSM 13864T = ATCC BAA-117T) are proposed for the two new species.
TI  - [Notification according to the law for protection against infections].
AB  - Since January 1st 2001, the Law for Protection Against Infections decrees the duty of notification along two tracks, on the one hand by notification of infectious diseases and on the other hand by reporting the pathogens. However, the names of pathogens change due to scientific progress. Furthermore, these names include in some cases not only harmful agents of infectious diseases but also inoffensive organisms, i. e. Giardia lamblia. There are also problems in the notification of other pathogens such as Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Chlamydia psittaci,Clostridium botulinum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leptospira interrogans, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar agents, Norwalk-like viruses, Salmonella Paratyphi, Treponema pallidum, Trichinella spiralis and pathogenic serovars of Yersinia enterocolitica. Finally, the abandonment of notification for glanders, lymphogranuloma venereum, ulcus molle and variola appears to be risky, the reasons being partly unconvincing and contradictory.
TI  - Cloning of the cel9A gene and characterization of its gene product from marine bacterium Pseudomonas sp. SK38.
AB  - The yellow-pigmented bacterial strain causing green spot rot and death of layer was isolated from Porphyra dentata. This strain has been identified as Pseudomonas sp., harboring agarase, xylanase, and protease activity, as well as carboxymethyl-cellulase (CMCase). Using genomic DNA from the Pseudomonas sp. SK38 digested with Sau3AI and ligated into pBluescript II KS+, we isolated a cel gene encoding a CMCase in Pseudomonas sp. SK38. A 4.5-kb fragment was subcloned into pKR400. The structure of the cel9A gene consists of an open reading frame of 1,521 bp starting with a GTG start codon and ending with a TAG stop codon. It thus encodes 506 amino acid residues of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 52,636 daltons plus a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cel9A protein is similar to the same protein of Clostridium thermocellum. It contains, in particular, the two conserved regions of the glycoside hydrolase family 9. The apparent molecular mass of the Cel9A protein is 52 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is most active at pH 6-7 and an optimal temperature of around 30 degrees C.
TI  - A thermostable collagenolytic protease with a very large molecular mass produced  by thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain MO-1.
AB  - A collagenolytic protease was purified to homogeneity from thermophilic Bacillus  sp. strain MO-1. The protease from strain MO-1 showed high activity toward type I and IV collagens and gelatin. However, peptide substrates (4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Arg and 2-furylacryloyl-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala) for collagenases were inert as substrates. The collagenolytic protease cleaved oxidized insulin B-chain at 11 sites and degraded type I and IV collagens into anonymous small pieces, suggesting that the protease digests collagens at multiple sites. The collagenolytic protease was far more thermostable than a mesophilic Clostridium histolyticum collagenase. The collagenolytic protease possesses two salient features: (1) it has a very large molecular mass, 210 kDa, and consists of two, identical 105-kDa subunits; (2) it belongs to a serine protease group. The high molecular mass is unique among serine proteases but common for collagenases. The features of the enzyme from strain MO-1 suggest that it is a new collagenolytic protease which is distinct from previously reported collagenases and serine proteases.
TI  - [Retroperitoneal postoperative necrotizing fasciitis].
AB  - This is a report on clinical experience had with 17 patients presenting necrotizing fasciitis--a complication ever more frequently encountered. The case material is distributed in two group differing by origin and clinical course of the complication. In group one (n = 11) it is a matter of postoperative development of postoperative complication, consistent with the classical "per continuitatem" and "per contiguitatem" mechanisms, while in group two (n = 6) the process originates, evolves and speads within the retroperitoneal space proper. Comprehensive microbiological examinations performed in 13 cases show that in either group different microorganisms are identified. In group one aerobic-anaerobic mixed infection is documented in all patients, with predominance of Enterobacteroidaceae among aerobic ones. In group two, anaerobic bacterial species, mainly Clostridium sp, prevail in all the isolates. The clinical study points to a substantial difference in the time of septic complication occurrence, as well as between the clinical picture of the two species. Accordingly, the final results are radically different--in group one survivorship amounts to 62.6%, whereas in group two--to 16.6% only.
TI  - Structural basis for the substrate specificity of the feruloyl esterase domain of the cellulosomal xylanase Z from Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - Feruloyl esterases function in the cleavage of ferulic acid's bonds to arabinoxylan and pectin where the ferulic acid moieties cross-link the layers of polysaccharide chains within hemicellulose. This work presents the crystal structure of FAE_XynZ, the domain of Clostridium thermocellum's cellulosomal xylanase Z that displays feruloyl esterase activity. The structure was obtained via multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using three heavy atom derivatives and refined against X-ray diffraction data of up to 1.75 A resolution. The R-value of the final model was 0.187 (R(free) = 0.21). FAE_XynZ displays an eight-stranded alpha/beta-fold with the characteristic "catalytic triad" at the heart of the active site. To define the substrate specificity determinants of the enzyme, the crystal structures of FAE_XynZ and the inactive FAE_XynZ(S172A) mutant were determined in complexes with the feruloyl-arabinoxylans FAXX and FAX(3), respectively. In the complex crystals, the ferulic acid moieties are clearly recognizable and allowed identification of the hydrophobic binding pocket. The carbohydrate part of both substrates is not visible in either structure. The location of the putative carbohydrate binding-pocket was inferred based on the location and orientation of the adjacent ferulic acid molecule. Five of the six residues lining the pocket were found to be conserved in FAE A from Orpinomyces sp., which further supports the proposed role of these amino acids.
TI  - Caloranaerobacter azorensis gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic thermophilic bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.
AB  - A thermophilic, anaerobic, chemo-organotrophic bacterium, designated MV1087T, was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The cells were straight, motile and stained gram-negative. Growth was observed from 45 to 65 degrees C, with an optimum around 65 degrees C. No growth was observed at 40 or 70 degrees C. Growth was observed from pH 5.5 to 9.0 and the optimum pH was around 7. The salinity range for growth was 10-100 g sea salt l(-1) (corresponding to 6.5-65 g NaCl l(-1)) with an optimum at 30 g sea salt l(-1) (20 g NaCl l(-1)). Strain MV1087T was heterotrophic, able to ferment proteinaceous substrates, such as brain/heart infusion and gluten, and carbohydrates, such as glucose, xylan and starch. The DNA G+C content was 27 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses using 16S rDNA sequences indicated that strain MV1087T belonged to cluster XII of the Clostridium subphylum. Due to its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, isolate MV1087T is proposed as a novel species of a new genus, Caloranaerobacter azorensis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is MV1087T (= CNCM I-2543T = DSM 13643T).
TI  - Involvement of coenzyme A esters and two new enzymes, an enoyl-CoA hydratase and  a CoA-transferase, in the hydration of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine by Escherichia coli.
AB  - Two proteins (CaiB and CaiD) were found to catalyze the reversible biotransformation of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine in Escherichia coli in the presence of a cosubstrate (e.g., gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA or crotonobetainyl-CoA). CaiB (45 kDa) and CaiD (27 kDa) were purified in two steps to electrophoretic homogeneity from overexpression strains. CaiB was identified as crotonobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. The enzyme exhibits high cosubstrate specificity to CoA derivatives of trimethylammonium compounds. In particular, the N-terminus of CaiB shows significant identity with other CoA-transferases (e.g., FldA from Clostridium sporogenes, Frc from Oxalobacter formigenes, and BbsE from Thauera aromatica) and CoA-hydrolases (e.g., BaiF from Eubacterium sp.). CaiD was shown to be a crotonobetainyl-CoA hydratase using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays. Besides crotonobetainyl-CoA CaiD is also able to hydrate crotonyl-CoA with a significantly lower Vmax (factor of 10(3)) but not crotonobetaine. The substrate specificity of CaiD and its homology to the crotonase confirm this enzyme as a new member of the crotonase superfamily. Concluding these results, it was verified that hydration of crotonobetaine to L-carnitine proceeds at the CoA level in two steps: the CaiD catalyzed hydration of crotonobetainyl-CoA to L-carnitinyl-CoA, followed by a CoA transfer from L-carnitinyl-CoA to crotonobetaine, catalyzed by CaiB. When gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as a cosubstrate (CoA donor), the first reaction is the CoA transfer. The optimal ratios of CaiB and CaiD during this hydration reaction, determined to be 4:1 when crotonobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate and 5:1 when gamma-butyrobetainyl-CoA was used as cosubstrate, are different from that found for in vivo conditions (1:3).
TI  - The effect of condensed tannins from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  - Five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (CT) purified from Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. Streptococcus bovis NCFB 2476, Eubacterium sp. C124b, Prevotella bryantii B14, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c, and Clostridium proteoclasticum B316T were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg CT x mL(-1) extracted from L. pedunculatus and L. corniculatus. In the absence of CT, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (OD) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. Growth of Eubacterium sp., P. bryantii, and B. fibrisolvens was inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) more by the CT from L. pedunculatus than by the CT from L. corniculatus. All strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x mL(-1) of the CT from L. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum OD600 values than (minus CT) controls, except for S. bovis. At 400 and 600 microg x mL(-1), the addition of CT from L. pedunculatus inhibited (P < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. The growth of Eubacterium sp. and P. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h of incubation (P < 0.001) by 200 microg x mL(-1) of CT from L. corniculatus, but then declined leading to a significant difference in OD values compared with the controls. At 400 microg x mL(-1), the CT from L. corniculatus reduced (P < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except S. bovis, while 600 microg x mL(-1) inhibited (P < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. To study the mechanism of CT action, the degradation of the large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; Fraction 1 Leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or Rubisco were preincubated with CT extracted from L. corniculatus and L. pedunculatus. Both preincubations decreased LSU degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) addition. Addition of PEG to CT-Rubisco preincubations negated the effects of CT, while PEG addition to CT-bacteria preincubations did not. This implies that the CT-bacterial interaction is stronger than the CT-Rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. Also, L. pedunculatus CT reduced the degradation of the LSU to a greater extent than the CT from L. corniculatus when preincubated with bacteria.
TI  - Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).
AB  - In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding regions.
TI  - Biological degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.
AB  - Nitroaromatic compounds are xenobiotics that have found multiple applications in  the synthesis of foams, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and explosives. These compounds are toxic and recalcitrant and are degraded relatively slowly in the environment by microorganisms. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is the most widely used nitroaromatic compound. Certain strains of Pseudomonas and fungi can use TNT as a nitrogen source through the removal of nitrogen as nitrite from TNT under aerobic conditions and the further reduction of the released nitrite to ammonium, which is incorporated into carbon skeletons. Phanerochaete chrysosporium and other fungi mineralize TNT under ligninolytic conditions by converting it into reduced TNT intermediates, which are excreted to the external milieu, where they are substrates for ligninolytic enzymes. Most if not all aerobic microorganisms reduce TNT to the corresponding amino derivatives via the formation of nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates. Condensation of the latter compounds yields highly recalcitrant azoxytetranitrotoluenes. Anaerobic microorganisms can also degrade TNT through different pathways. One pathway, found in Desulfovibrio and Clostridium, involves reduction of TNT to triaminotoluene; subsequent steps are still not known. Some Clostridium species may reduce TNT to hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes, which are then further metabolized. Another pathway has been described in Pseudomonas sp. strain JLR11 and involves nitrite release and further reduction to ammonium, with almost 85% of the N-TNT incorporated as organic N in the cells. It was recently reported that in this strain TNT can serve as a final electron acceptor in respiratory chains and that the reduction of TNT is coupled to ATP synthesis. In this review we also discuss a number of biotechnological applications of bacteria and fungi, including slurry reactors, composting, and land farming, to remove TNT from polluted soils. These treatments have been designed to achieve mineralization or reduction of TNT and immobilization of its amino derivatives on humic material. These approaches are highly efficient in removing TNT, and increasing amounts of research into the potential usefulness of phytoremediation, rhizophytoremediation, and transgenic plants with bacterial genes for TNT removal are being done.
TI  - Expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. This process is attributed to enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The presence of Clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56 intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured Clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. Such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. METHODS: A total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. Of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. These 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D glucuronide as substrate. Results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. RESULTS: C. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for E coli, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp., and Klebsiella sp. CONCLUSION: C. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than E coli and Klebsiella sp.
TI  - Noncatalytic docking domains of cellulosomes of anaerobic fungi.
AB  - A method is presented for the specific isolation of genes encoding cellulosome components from anaerobic fungi. The catalytic components of the cellulosome of anaerobic fungi typically contain, besides the catalytic domain, mostly two copies of a 40-amino-acid cysteine-rich, noncatalytic docking domain (NCDD) interspaced by short linkers. Degenerate primers were designed to anneal to the highly conserved region within the NCDDs of the monocentric fungus Piromyces sp. strain E2 and the polycentric fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. Through PCR using cDNA from Orpinomyces sp. and genomic DNA from Piromyces sp. as templates, respectively, 9 and 19 PCR products were isolated encoding novel NCDD linker sequences. Screening of an Orpinomyces sp. cDNA library with four of these PCR products resulted in the isolation of new genes encoding cellulosome components. An alignment of the partial NCDD sequence information obtained and an alignment of database-accessible NCDD sequences, focusing on the number and position of cysteine residues, indicated the presence of three structural subfamilies within fungal NCDDs. Furthermore, evidence is presented that the NCDDs in CelC from the polycentric fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2 specifically recognize four proteins in a cellulosome preparation, indicating the presence of multiple scaffoldins.
TI  - The capsaicin VR1 receptor mediates substance P release in toxin A-induced enteritis in rats.
AB  - The mechanism by which Clostridium difficile toxin A causes substance P (SP) release and subsequent inflammation in the rat ileum is unknown. Pretreatment with the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonist, capsazepine, before toxin A administration significantly inhibited toxin A-induced SP release and intestinal inflammation. Intraluminal administration of the VR1 agonist capsaicin caused intestinal inflammation similar to the effects of toxin A. Pretreatment with capsazepine before capsaicin administration also significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced intestinal inflammation. These results suggest that intraluminal toxin A causes SP release from primary sensory neurons via stimulation of VR1 receptors resulting in intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Microbiological quality of the bivalve Pinctada imbricata commercialized in Cumana, Venezuela.
AB  - The habitual consumption of oysters in the city of Cumana, Venezuela, is made in  poor sanitary conditions, therefore a study was carried out to determine the sanitary quality of the product. For this, 120 samples of oyster Pinctada imbricata were collected directly from: a) Fishing boats (unhandled samples) and b) after being shucked by the salesman (handled samples). Unhandled samples showed the following MPN/g: Faecal coliforms < 3 - 2.2 x 10, Aeromonas sp. < 3 - 1.1 x 10(3), Staphylococcus aureus < 3 - 7.5 x 10; Clostridium perfringens < 3 - 9.3 x 10); cfu/g Enterobacteriaceae 3 - 4.1 x 10(2); total aerobes 2.9 x 10(2) - 6.9 x 10(5); 6% of S. aureus were coagulase positive. Values of MPN/g of handled samples were higher: Faecal coliforms 4 - 4.6 x 10(2); E. coli 9 - 2.1 x 10(2), Aeromonas 3 - 4.6 x 10(2), S. aureus 2.3 x 10 - 4.6 x 10(2), C. perfringens < 3 - 2.8 x 10(2), and cfu/g counts of Enterobacteriaceae 5.4 x 10 - 6.5 x 10(6), total aerobes 30 - 2.8 x 10(5); 25% of S. aureus were coagulase positive. Salmonella sp. was detected in two of the handled samples. These results suggest contamination in growth areas of bivalve and during the collecting operation, which is increased by handling of the product by the salesman.
TI  - Chitinolytic bacteria of the mammal digestive tract.
AB  - Chitinolytic bacteria were isolated from the digestive tract of different mammals and characterized. All isolates were facultatively anaerobic, long Gram-positive, straight rods resembling Clostridium sp. Only one isolate consisted of Gram-positive ovoid cells. All cultures grew on glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, galactose, starch, hemicellulose and xylan. Fermentation products were mainly formate, acetate, butyrate and lactate. The isolates were identified as Clostridium sartagoforme (2 species), C. aminovalericum, C. bifermentans and Enterococcus durans (1 isolate of each species). Exocellular fractions of all strains exhibited higher activities of all enzymes than cellular ones. Inductive effects of hemicelluloses, pectin and laminarine on chitinases were demonstrated. High exocellular endochitinase activity was found in cultures grown on chitin. N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity was low with the exception of exocellular fractions of two strains of C. sartagoforme.
TI  - Deletion of neutral endopeptidase exacerbates intestinal inflammation induced by  Clostridium difficile toxin A.
AB  - Toxin A (TxA) of Clostridium difficile induces acute inflammation of the intestine initiated by release of substance P (SP) and activation of the neurokinin-1 receptor. However, the mechanisms that terminate this response are unknown. We determined whether the SP-degrading enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) terminates TxA-induced enteritis. We used both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of NEP to test this hypothesis. In wild-type mice, instillation of TxA (0.5-5 microg) into ileal loops for 3 h dose dependently increased ileal fluid secretion, stimulated granulocyte transmigration determined by myeloperoxidase activity, and caused histological damage characterized by depletion of enterocytes, edema, and neutrophil accumulation. Deletion of NEP reduced the threshold secretory and inflammatory dose of TxA and exacerbated the inflammatory responses by more than twofold. This exacerbated inflammation was prevented by pretreatment with recombinant NEP. Conversely, pretreatment of wild-type mice with the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon exacerbated enteritis. Thus NEP terminates enteritis induced by C. difficile TxA, underlying the importance of SP degradation in limiting neurogenic inflammation.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Because of the increasing number of renal transplantations performed and the rarity of reported cases of infective endocarditis in these patients, we studied the clinical characteristics of this infection in this population. We report on two cases from our experience and review reported cases of infective endocarditis in renal transplant recipients retrieved from the MEDLINE system. In addition, we reviewed a large series of infective endocarditis looking for patients with renal transplants. In addition to our 2 cases, 12 previously reported cases were found. The mean time from transplantation to diagnosis of infective endocarditis was 3.5 years (range 2 months to 15 years). Causative organisms included fungi, Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases each), Corynebacterium sp. (2 cases), Streptococcus viridans, VRE, Brucella sp., Clostridium sp., Nocardia sp. and Erysipelothrix sp. (one case each). Skin manifestations of endocarditis and/or splenomegaly were not reported in these patients. Septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms were relatively common. The overall mortality rate was 50% (7 of 14 patients died). Infective endocarditis seems to be rare in renal transplant recipients. The few reported cases are characterized by unusual causative micro-organisms and atypical clinical presentation. Further studies are needed to delineate the magnitude and scope of this association.
TI  - Clostridium uliginosum sp. nov., a novel acid-tolerant, anaerobic bacterium with  connecting filaments.
AB  - An anaerobic, acid-tolerant bacterium, CK55T, was isolated from an acidic forest  bog. Cells of CK55T stained Gram-negative but did not have an outer membrane. Cells were spore-forming, motile rods with peritrichous flagella, formed chains or aggregates and were linked by connecting filaments that were composed of a core and outer sheath. Cellobiose, glucose, xylose, mannose, mannitol, sucrose and peptone supported growth. Arabinose, lactose, raffinose, H2/CO2, CO/CO2, vanillate, Casamino acids and various purines and pyrimidines did not support growth. Growth on carbohydrates yielded acetate, butyrate, lactate, formate and H2 as end-products. Growth was observed at pH 4.0-9.0, with an optimum at pH 6.5, and at 10-30 degrees C, with an optimum at 20-25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, doubling times were 4 and 6 h at pH 6.5 and 4.0, respectively. Hydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts was 12 U (mg protein)-1. CK55T did not: (i) contain detectable levels of CO, formate, lactate dehydrogenases or cytochromes; (ii) carry out dissimilatory reduction of nitrate or sulfate; or (iii) produce methane. Thus, CK55T was characterized as a non-acetogenic, fermentative chemo-organotroph. The G+C content of CK55T was 28.0 mol%. CK55T was phylogenetically most closely related to Clostridium botulinum (types B, E and F), Clostridium acetobutylicum and other saccharolytic clostridia; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the nearest relatives of CK55T were approximately 97%. Based on morphological, physiological and phylogenetic properties of CK55T, it is proposed that CK55T be termed Clostridium uliginosum sp. nov. (= DSM 12992T = ATCC BAA-53T).
TI  - Differentiation of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum from non-toxigenic clostridia, isolated from prepared and frozen foods by PCR-DAN based methods.
AB  - During the elaboration process of prepared and frozen foods, Clostridium sp. have been reported. From those microorganisms, C. perfringens and C. botulinum may pose a high risk for the consumers. To avoid these pathogenic organisms an HACCP program should be implemented, but in addition sensitive and moderately time consuming microbiological methods for monitoring C. perfringens and C. boulinum should be established. In this work, an RFLP analysis of the 16S rDNA will be developed to differentiate C. perfringens from other Clostridium sp. In addition, a PCR protocol, will be assayed to detect C. botulinum. Both two methods will be compared with biochemical characterization by API system. The restriction analysis of the 16S rDNA with Taq I and Rsa I showed at least the same sensitivity to differentiate C. perfringens from clostridial isolates as biochemical identification. However, the former method takes only 8-10 h of analysis as compared with 24-48 h required for biochemical characterization. With the specific PCR protocol to detect C. botulinum a band of 1.1 kbp was obtained derived from the specific amplification of BoNT genes, taking 6-8 h for analysis. Both two molecular DNA based methods should be considered as verification techniques of pathogenic clostridia in the HACCP program.
TI  - Anaerobranca gottschalkii sp. nov., a novel thermoalkaliphilic bacterium that grows anaerobically at high pH and temperature.
AB  - A novel thermoalkaliphilic, obligately anaerobic bacterium was isolated from a humid soil sample of a hot inlet of Lake Bogoria, Kenya. The newly isolated strain grows optimally at pH 9.5 and 50-55 degrees C and its growth range is pH 6.0-10.5 and 30-65 degrees C. Unlike the already known thermoalkaliphiles, the strain grows heterotrophically on a variety of mono- and polysaccharides (glucose, ribose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, starch, pullulan, xylan and cellulose) and on proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone and tryptone. No dissimilatory sulfate reduction was observed, whereas thiosulfate was found to enhance growth when glucose or starch were used as substrates. Under optimal conditions, the doubling time is 48 min. Sodium ions are necessary for growth, with an optimal concentration of 230 mM (1% NaCl, w/v) at pH 9.5. The rod-shaped cells are motile in the exponential growth phase under optimal growth conditions. Despite the Gram-negative staining and negative KOH assay, the strain is a Gram-positive organism, having an atypically thin cell wall. A sheath-like structure occurs at the cell separation area and parts of a surface layer-like structure were also observed. Based on physiological properties and molecular biological analysis, the strain falls within the radiation of the clostridia and represents a new species of Anaerobranca within the Clostridium/Bacillus subphylum of the Gram-positive bacteria. Strain LBS3T (= DSM 13577T) is named Anaerobranca gottschalkii sp. nov. and is designated as the type strain.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of enterocin SE-K4 produced by thermophilic enterococci, Enterococcus faecalis K-4.
AB  - Enterococcus sp. K-4, with a bacteriocin-like activity against E. faecium, was isolated from grass silage in Thailand. Morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic studies clearly identified strain K-4 as a strain of E. faecalis. Strain K-4 produced a maximal amount of bacteriocin at 43-45 degrees C. We purified, for the first time, the bacteriocin produced at high temperature by E. faecalis to homogeneity, using adsorption on cells of the producer strain and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The bacteriocin, designated enterocin SE-K4, is a peptide of about 5 kDa as measured by SDS-PAGE, and Mass spectrometry analysis found the molecular mass of 5356.2, which is in good agreement. The amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal end of enterocin SE-K4 showed apparent sequence similarity to class IIa bacteriocins. Enterocin SE-K4 was active against E. faecium, E. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium beijerinckii, and Listeria monocytogenes. Enterocin SE-K4 is very heat stable.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - Analysis of KdpC of the K(+)-transporting KdpFABC complex of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Kdp complex, a high affinity ATP-driven K(+) transport system of Escherichia  coli, is composed of the four membrane-bound subunits KdpF, KdpA, KdpB and KdpC. Whereas the role of KdpB (catalytical subunit), KdpA (K(+)-translocating subunit) and KdpF (stabilizing peptide) is well understood, the function of KdpC is still unknown. Therefore, a kdpC deletion strain was constructed and complementation experiments were performed using different kdpC constructs. Truncations of the kdpC gene revealed that only one derivative, which lacks base pairs coding for the four C-terminal amino acids, was able to complement the chromosomal deletion of kdpC. Furthermore, complementation was also observed with kdpC of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not with kdpC from Clostridium acetobutylicum or Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Sequence alignment of 17 different KdpC proteins led to the construction of hybrids between kdpC of E. coli and that of C. acetobutylicum. Complementation revealed that the N-terminal transmembrane segment as well as the C-terminal-third of the protein can be exchanged between both species, but only one after the other. A simultaneous substitution of both regions was not possible.
TI  - Bacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA dynamics during an acetate crisis in an anaerobic digestor ecosystem.
AB  - The dynamics of bacterial and archaeal populations of a laboratory-scale anaerobic digestor were investigated during a crisis period of the process reflected by an accumulation of acetate. A culture-independent approach based on single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of total 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA amplification products was used. A spirochete and a Synergistes sp. showed high and changing activity levels during the study. A Clostridium sp. showed a transient increase in presence and activity concomitant with the highest acetate concentrations. A major shift in the most active archaeal populations from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic methanogens preceded the recovery of the reactor.
TI  - Spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  - This short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. As a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. Molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. For example, for Salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of S. typhimurium DT104 in 1998. The high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. The resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.
TI  - Clostridium hiranonis sp. nov., a human intestinal bacterium with bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity.
AB  - The Clostridium-like organisms TO-931T and HD-17, isolated from human faeces, have high levels of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity. Sequencing of their 16S rDNA demonstrated that they belong to cluster XI of the genus Clostridium and that they represent a new and distinct line of descent. Clostridium bifermentans and Clostridium sordellii in cluster XI also possess bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments with the isolates, TO-931T and HD-17, and C bifermentans and C. sordellii revealed that the isolates are a single species distinct from C. bifermentans and C sordellii. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, using 16S rDNA sequences, and DNA-DNA hybridization analysis, it is concluded that strains TO-931T and HD-17 are members of a new species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium hiranonis is proposed. The type strain is strain TO-931T (= JCM 10541T = DSM 13275T).
TI  - Carboxydobrachium pacificum gen. nov., sp. nov., a new anaerobic, thermophilic, CO-utilizing marine bacterium from Okinawa Trough.
AB  - A new anaerobic, thermophilic, CO-utilizing marine bacterium, strain JMT, was isolated from a submarine hot vent in Okinawa Trough. Cells of strain JMT were non-motile thin straight rods, sometimes branching, with a cell wall of the Gram-positive type, surrounded with an S-layer. Chains of three to five cells were often observed. The isolate grew chemolithotrophically on CO, producing equimolar quantities of H2 and CO2 (according to the equation CO+H2O-->CO2+H2) and organotrophically on peptone, yeast extract, starch, cellobiose, glucose, galactose, fructose and pyruvate, producing H2, acetate and CO2. Growth was observed from 50 to 80 degrees C with an optimum at 70 degrees C. The optimum pH was 6.8-7.1. The optimum concentration of sea salts in the medium was 20.5-25.5 g l(-1). The generation time under optimal conditions was 7.1 h. The DNA G+C content was 33 mol %. Growth of isolate JMT was not inhibited by penicillin, but ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin completely inhibited growth. The results of 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that strain JMT belongs to the Thermoanaerobacter phylogenetic group within the Bacillus-Clostridium subphylum of Gram-positive bacteria but represents a separate branch of this group. On the basis of morphological and physiological features and phylogenetic data, this isolate should be assigned to a new genus, for which the name Carboxydobrachium is proposed. The type species is Carboxydobrachium pacificum; the type strain is JMT (= DSM 12653T).
TI  - Clostridium hungatei sp. nov., a mesophilic, N2-fixing cellulolytic bacterium isolated from soil.
AB  - Two strains of obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic, N2-fixing, spore-forming bacteria were isolated from soil samples collected at two different locations near Amherst, MA, USA. Single cells of both strains were slightly curved rods that measured between 2 and 6 microm in length and approximately 0.5 microm in diameter. The spores were spherical, terminally located, distended the sporangium and measured 0.8-1.0 microm in diameter. The cells of both isolates (designated strain ADT and strain B3B) stained Gram-negative, but did not have a typical Gram-negative cell wall structure as demonstrated by transmission electron microscope analysis. The cells of both strains were motile with subpolarly inserted flagella and exhibited chemotactic behaviour towards cellobiose and D-glucose. Both strains fermented cellulose, xylan, cellobiose, cellodextrins, D-glucose, D-xylose, D-fructose, D-mannose and gentiobiose. In addition, strain B3B fermented L-arabinose. For both strains, fermentation products from cellulose were acetate, ethanol, H2 and CO2, as well as small amounts of lactate and formate. The G+C content of strain AD was 40 mol% and that of strain B3B was 42 mol%. Based on their morphological, physiological and phylogenetic characteristics, it was concluded that the two isolates are representatives of a novel species of Clostridium. The name Clostridium hungatei is proposed for the new species. The type strain of Clostridium hungatei sp. nov. is strain ADT (= ATCC 700212T).
TI  - Effects of Clostridium difficile toxins on epithelial cell barrier.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the primary agent responsible for many patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and almost all patients with pseudomembranous colitis following antibiotic therapy. C. difficile infection is the most frequent form of colitis in hospitals and nursing homes and affects millions of patients in the United States and abroad. The first event in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection involves alterations of the indigenous colonic microflora by antibiotics, followed by colonization with C. difficile. C. difficile causes diarrhea and colitis by releasing two high molecular weight protein exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, with potent cytotoxic and enterotoxic properties. Evidence presented here indicates that C. difficile toxins compromise the epithelial cell barrier by at least two pathophysiologic pathways, one involving disaggregation of actin microfilaments in colonocytes via glucosylation of the Rho family of proteins leading to epithelial cell destruction and opening of the tight junctions, whereas the other appears to involve early release of proinflammatory cytokines from intestinal epithelial cells probably via activation of MAP kinases. We speculate that cytokines released from intestinal epithelial cells in response to toxin A exposure will diffuse into the lamina propria and activate macrophages, enteric nerves, and sensory neurons to release SP, CGRP, and NT, which, in turn, interact with immune and inflammatory cells and amplify the inflammatory response. Dissection of this inflammatory cascade may help us understand the pathophysiology of inflammatory diarrhea caused by this important pathogen.
TI  - Deduced amino acid sequence and possible catalytic residues of a thermostable, alkaline cellulase from an Alkaliphilic bacillus strain.
AB  - Alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-S237 (a relative of Bacillus pseudofirmus) produces a thermostable, alkaline endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (Egl). The entire gene for the enzyme harbored a 2,472-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 824 amino acids, including a 30-aminoacid signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme (794 amino acids, 88,284 Da) showed very high similarity to those of family 5 mesophilic, alkaline Egls from some alkaliphilic bacilli. The enzyme had a region similar to a novel cellulose binding domain proposed for an Egl (EngF) from Clostridium cellulovorans. Expression of the Bacillus Egl gene in Bacillus subtilis resulted in high carboxymethy cellulase activity (2.0 g/l) in the culture broth, concomitant with the appearance of a protein band on an SDS gel at 86 kDa. Site-directed mutagenesis delineated the importance of Arg111, His151, Glu190, His262, Tyr264, and Glu305 in catalysis and/or substrate binding of the enzyme.
TI  - Novel targets for the pharmacotherapy of diarrhoea: a view for the millennium.
AB  - Acute diarrhoea continues to carry a high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Intestinal infection is the major cause of acute diarrhoea although the prevalence of individual pathogens varies according to geographic location. In many countries in the industrialized world, reports of intestinal infections continue to increase; these are largely related to waterborne and foodborne outbreaks. Acute diarrhoea may be due to increased intestinal secretion, commonly as a result of infection with enterotoxin-producing organisms (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae) or to decreased intestinal absorption from infection with organisms that damage the intestinal epithelium (enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella sp., Salmonella sp.). Although oral rehydration therapy has reduced the mortality associated with acute diarrhoea, the diarrhoea attack rate remains unchanged and stool volume often increases during the rehydration process. The search for agents that will directly inhibit intestinal secretory mechanisms and thereby reduce stool volume has been going on for more than 20 years. Research during the past decade has highlighted the importance of neurohumoral mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea, notably the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and neural reflexes within the enteric nervous system. Cholera toxin, E. coli enterotoxins and Clostridium difficile toxin A are known to invoke these mechanisms in diarrhoea pathogenesis. This new dimension of intestinal pathophysiology has already exposed possible novel targets for anti-secretory therapy, namely, 5-HT receptor antagonists, substance P antagonists and the possibility for potentiating the proabsorptive effects of endogenous enkephalins by use of enkephalinase inhibitors. There now seems to be a real possibility that anti-secretory therapy will become more widely available in the future.
TI  - Propionispora vibrioides, nov. gen., nov. sp., a new gram-negative, spore-forming anaerobe that ferments sugar alcohols.
AB  - Anaerobic enrichment cultures, with erythritol as substrate, resulted in the isolation of a strain with properties not yet found in an existing genus in this combination. The strain, FKBS1, was strictly anaerobic, stained gram-negative and formed spores. Cells were small motile vibrios with flagella inserted at the concave side of the cell. Spores were located terminally and caused only slight swelling of the cells if compared to related spore-forming genera. FKBS1 fermented fructose, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol and erythritol to propionic acid, acetic acid, CO2 and small amounts of H2 to balance the difference in the oxidation-reduction value between substrate and cell mass. The 16S rDNA sequence revealed relationship to the Sporomusa-Pectinatus-Selenomonas group. However, the phylogenetic distance to any of its members was too great to allow it to be placed in one of the existing genera. Morphologically the strain resembled Sporomusa, which, however, performs an acetogenic type of fermentation. The propionic-acid-forming genera of the group are either not spore-formers or, in the case of Dendrosporobacter quercicolus (syn. Clostridium quercicolum), morphologically different. It is therefore proposed to classify strain FKBS1 as a new genus and species, Propionispora vibrioides.
TI  - Bacterial spore inhibition and inactivation in foods by pressure, chemical preservatives, and mild heat.
AB  - Sucrose laurates, sucrose palmitate, sucrose stearates, and monolaurin (Lauricidin) were evaluated for inhibitory effects against spores of Bacillus sp., Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and Alicyclobacillus sp. in a model agar system. The combined treatment of sucrose laurate, high hydrostatic pressure, and mild heat was evaluated on spores of Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus in foods. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the sucrose esters were higher than that of Lauricidin for all spores tested in the model agar system, but Lauricidin was not the most readily suspended in the test media. The sucrose laurates and sucrose palmitate were more effective and more readily suspended than the sucrose stearates. A combined treatment of sucrose laurate (<1.0%), 392 megaPascals (MPa) at 45 degrees C for 10 to 15 min provided 3- to 5.5-log10 CFU/ml reductions from initial populations of 10(6) CFU/ml for Bacillus subtilis 168 in milk, Bacillus cereus 14579 in beef, Bacillus coagulans 7050 in tomato juice (pH 4.5), Alicyclobacillus sp. N1089 in tomato juice (pH 4.5), and Alicyclobacillus sp. N1098 in apple juice. The most notable change in the appearance of the products was temporary foaming during mixing of the sucrose laurate in the foods. The effect of sucrose laurate appeared to be inhibitory rather than lethal to the spores. The inhibitory effects observed on Bacillus and Alicyclobacillus spores by the combined treatment of pressure, mild heat, and sucrose laurate appear promising for food applications where alternatives to high heat processing are desired.
TI  - Fermentation by gut microbiota cultured in a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem is improved by supplementing a soygerm powder.
AB  - An in vitro model, designated the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME), was used to study the effect of a soygerm powder rich in beta-glycosidic phytoestrogenic isoflavones on the fermentation pattern of the colon microbiota and to determine to what extent the latter metabolize the conjugated phytoestrogens. Initially, an inoculum prepared from human feces was introduced into the reactor vessels and stabilized over 3 wk using a culture medium. This stabilization period was followed by a 2-wk control period during which the microbiota were monitored. The microbiota were then subjected to a 2-wk treatment period by adding 2.5 g/d soygerm powder to the culture medium. The addition resulted into an overall increase of bacterial marker populations (Enterobacteriaceae:, coliforms, Lactobacillus: sp., Staphylococcus: sp. and Clostridium: sp.), with a significant increase of the Lactobacillus: sp. population. The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration increased approximately 30% during the supplementation period; this was due mainly to a significant increase of acetic and propionic acids. Gas analysis revealed that the methane concentration increased significantly. Ammonium and sulfide concentrations were not influenced by soygerm supplementation. Use of an electronic nose apparatus indicated that odor concentrations decreased significantly during the treatment period. The beta-glycosidic bonds of the phytoestrogenic isoflavones were cleaved under the conditions prevailing in the large intestine. The increased bacterial fermentation after addition of the soygerm powder was paralleled by substantial metabolism of the free isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein), resulting in recovery of only 12-17% of the supplemented isoflavones.
TI  - Chemostat enrichments of human feces with resistant starch are selective for adherent butyrate-producing clostridia at high dilution rates.
AB  - Resistant starch (RS) enrichments were made using chemostats inoculated with human feces from two individuals at two dilution rates (D = 0.03 h(-1) and D = 0.30 h(-1)) to select for slow- and fast-growing amylolytic communities. The fermentations were studied by analysis of short-chain fatty acids, amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, and viable counts of the predominant culturable populations and the use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. Considerable butyrate was produced at D = 0. 30 h(-1), which corresponded with reduced branched-chain fatty acid formation. At both dilution rates, high levels of extracellular amylase activity were produced, while alpha-glucosidase was predominantly cell associated. Bacteroides and bifidobacteria predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas saccharolytic clostridia became more important at D = 0.30 h(-1). Microscopic examination showed that within 48 h of inoculation, one particular bacterial morphotype predominated in RS enrichments at D = 0.30 h(-1). This organism attached apically to RS granules and formed rosette-like structures which, with glycocalyx formation, agglomerated to form biofilm networks in the planktonic phase. Attempts to isolate this bacterium in pure culture were repeatedly unsuccessful, although a single colony was eventually obtained. On the basis of its 16S rDNA sequence, this RS-degrading, butyrate-producing organism was identified as being a previously unidentified group I Clostridium sp. A 16S rRNA-targeted probe was designed using this sequence and used to assess the abundance of the population in the enrichments. At 240 h, its contributions to total rRNA in the chemostats were 5 and 23% at D = 0.03 and 0.30 h(-1), respectively. This study indicates that bacterial populations with significant metabolic potential can be overlooked using culture-based methodologies. This may provide a paradigm for explaining the discrepancy between the low numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria that are isolated from fecal samples and the actual production of butyrate.
TI  - Modeling reduction of uranium U(VI) under variable sulfate concentrations by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  - The kinetics for the reduction of sulfate alone and for concurrent uranium [U(VI)] and sulfate reduction, by mixed and pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) at 21 +/- 3 degrees C were studied. The mixed culture contained the SRB Desulfovibrio vulgaris along with a Clostridium sp. determined via 16S ribosomal DNA analysis. The pure culture was Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 7757). A zero-order model best fit the data for the reduction of sulfate from 0.1 to 10 mM. A lag time occurred below cell concentrations of 0.1 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. For the mixed culture, average values for the maximum specific reaction rate, V(max), ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of SRB. h(-1)) at 0.25 mM sulfate to 5.0 +/- 1.1 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of SRB. h(-1) at 10 mM sulfate (average cell concentration, 0.52 mg [dry weight]/ml). For the pure culture, V(max) was 1.6 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of SRB. h(-1) at 1 mM sulfate (0.29 mg [dry weight] of cells/ml). When both electron acceptors were present, sulfate reduction remained zero order for both cultures, while uranium reduction was first order, with rate constants of 0.071 +/- 0.003 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) for the mixed culture and 0.137 +/- 0.016 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) (U(0) = 1 mM) for the D. desulfuricans culture. Both cultures exhibited a faster rate of uranium reduction in the presence of sulfate and no lag time until the onset of U reduction in contrast to U alone. This kinetics information can be used to design an SRB-dominated biotreatment scheme for the removal of U(VI) from an aqueous source.
TI  - Thermacetogenium phaeum gen. nov., sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic, thermophilic,  syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium.
AB  - A novel anaerobic, thermophilic, syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium, strain PB(T), was isolated from a thermophilic (55 degrees C) anaerobic methanogenic reactor which had been treating kraft-pulp waste water. The bacterium oxidized acetate in co-culture with a thermophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogen. Strain PB(T), a gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium grew optimally at 58 degrees C and pH 6.8. The bacterium grew acetogenically on several alcohols, methoxylated aromatics, pyruvate, glycine, cysteine, formate and hydrogen/CO2. Strain PB(T) also oxidized acetate with reduction of sulfate or thiosulfate as the electron acceptor. The bacterium contained MK-7 as the major quinone. The G+C content of the DNA was 53.5 mol%. Comparative 16S rDNA analysis indicated that strain PB(T) belongs to the Bacillus-Clostridium subphylum. However, it was distant from any known genera or micro-organism. The closest known relative was Thermoterrabacterium ferrireducens with 87.4% similarity. The name Thermacetogenium phaeum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain PBT (= DSM 12270T).
TI  - Catenibacterium mitsuokai gen. nov., sp. nov., a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Six strains of Eubacterium-like strains from human faeces were characterized by biochemical tests and analysis of cell wall peptidoglycan type and 16S rRNA. They were members of the Clostridium subphylum and have a specific phylogenetic association with Lactobacillus catenaformis and Lactobacillus vitulinus. These organisms resembled L. vitulinus in possessing the same A1gamma type of murein, but they showed different fermentation end-products. On the basis of a 16S rDNA sequence divergence of greater than 8% from L. vitulinus as well as phenotypic characteristics, a new genus, Catenibacterium, with one species (Catenibacterium mitsuokai), is proposed for six strains. The type strain of C. mitsuokai is JCM 10609T.
TI  - Anaerovorax odorimutans gen. nov., sp. nov., a putrescine-fermenting, strictly anaerobic bacterium.
AB  - The strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacterium strain NorPut1T ferments putrescine to acetate, butyrate, molecular hydrogen and ammonia. It also utilizes 4-aminobutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate as growth substrates. Comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis confirmed a phylogenetic affiliation of this strain to the phylum of gram-positive bacteria with low DNA G+C content. Together with its closest relative, 'Clostridium aminobutyricum' (DSM 2634), and several Eubacterium species, strain NorPut1T represents a well-defined monophyletic group. Moderate overall 16S rRNA sequence similarities (< 91%) were found for the NorPut1T/'Clostridium aminobutyricum' pair and several Eubacterium species. The type species, Eubacterium limosum, is not a member of the group and, together with Eubacterium barkeri and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, represents a distant phylogentic cluster. Therefore, a new genus, Anaerovorax, is proposed as harbouring strain NorPut1T (= DSM 5092T), which is described as a new species, i.e. Anaerovorax odorimutans.
TI  - Brain abscess caused by Clostridium sp. secondary to acute otomastoiditis.

TI  - Paramagnetic 1H NMR spectroscopy of the reduced, unbound photosystem I subunit PsaC: sequence-specific assignment of contact-shifted resonances and identification of mixed- and equal-valence Fe-Fe pairs in [4Fe-4S] centers FA- and FB-.
AB  - The PsaC subunit of Photosystem I (PS I) is a 9.3-kDa protein that binds two important cofactors in photosynthetic electron transfer: the [4Fe-4S] clusters FA and FB. The g-tensor orientation of FA- and FB- is believed to be correlated to the preferential localization of the mixed-valence and equal-valence (ferrous) iron pairs in each [4Fe-4S]+ cluster. The preferential position of the mixed-valence and equal-valence pairs, in turn. can be inferred from the study of the temperature dependence of contact-shifted resonances by 1H NMR spectroscopy. For this, a sequence-specific assignment of these signals is required. The 1H NMR spectrum of reduced, unbound PsaC from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 at 280.4 K in 99% D2O solution shows 18 hyperfine-shifted resonances. The non-solvent-exchangeable, hyperfine-shifted resonances of reduced PsaC are clearly identified as belonging to the cysteines coordinating the clusters FA- and FB- by their downfield chemical shifts, by their temperature dependencies, and by their short T1 relaxation times. The usual fast method of assigning the 1H NMR spectra of reduced [4Fe-4S] proteins through magnetization transfer from the oxidized to the reduced state was not feasible in the case of reduced PsaC. Therefore, a de novo self-consistent sequence-specific assignment of the hyperfine-shifted resonances was obtained based on dipolar connectivities from 1D NOE difference spectra and on longitudinal relaxation times using the X-ray structure of Clostridium acidi urici 2[4Fe-4S] cluster ferredoxin at 0.94 A resolution as a model. The results clearly show the same sequence-specific distribution of Curie and anti-Curie cysteines for unbound, reduced PsaC as established for other [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins; therefore, the mixed-valence and equal-valence (ferrous) Fe-Fe pairs in FA- and FB- have the same preferential positions relative to the protein. The analysis reveals that the magnetic properties of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters are essentially indistinguishable in unbound PsaC, in contrast to the PsaC that is bound as a component of the PS I complex.
TI  - Features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (C-HS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. The complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. METHODS: A 14-year-old male C-HS patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. Clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of C-HS. RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp. Biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. Ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. Viable dividing bacteria were found in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of C-HS granulocyte deficiency. Periodontal treatment of these patients is often unsuccessful. This case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.
TI  - Sequence analysis of bacterial DNA in the colon and stomach of the Tyrolean Iceman.
AB  - The male human body found in an Alpine glacier on September 19, 1991 ("Tyrolean Iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of a person from the Neolithic Age (5350-5100 B.P.). In the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for DNA extraction, and the DNA was PCR-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene (16s rDNA) of a broad range of bacteria. The PCR products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. The sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. The same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. These fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. The results show that the flora of the Iceman's stomach is entirely composed of Burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. The colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as Clostridium perfringens, C. ghonii, C. sordellii, Eubacterium tenue, and Bacteroides sp. The Iceman's colon, however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus Vibrio. The results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial DNA at the Iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the Iceman himself and on human coprolites.
TI  - Thermanaerovibrio velox sp. nov., a new anaerobic, thermophilic, organotrophic bacterium that reduces elemental sulfur, and emended description of the genus Thermanaerovibrio.
AB  - A moderately thermophilic, organotrophic bacterium with vibrioid cells was isolated from a sample of a cyanobacterial mat from caldera Uzon, Kamchatka, Russia, and designated strain Z-9701T. Cells of strain Z-9701T were curved, Gram-negative rods, 0.5-0.7 x 2.5-5.0 microm in size, with tapering ends and with fast, wavy movement by means of lateral flagella located on the concave side of the cell. Colonies were small, white, irregular or round, 0.2 mm in diameter, and with even edges. Strain Z-9701T was an obligate anaerobe with a temperature optimum at 60-65 degrees C and a pH optimum at 7.3. It fermented glucose, fructose, mannose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, adonite, arginine, serine, peptone, yeast extract and Casamino acids. The fermentation products formed during growth on glucose were acetate, lactate, H2, CO2 and ethanol. Strain Z-9701T reduced elemental sulfur to H2S during organotrophic growth with glucose or peptides as energy and carbon sources. In the presence of S0, strain Z-9701T was capable of lithotrophic growth with molecular hydrogen as energy substrate and 0.1 g yeast extract l(-1) as carbon source. Sulfate, thiosulfate, nitrate, Fe(III) and sulfite were not reduced and did not stimulate growth. The G+C content of strain Z-9701T DNA was 54.6 mol%. The results of 16S rDNA sequence analyses revealed that strain Z-9701T belongs to the cluster within the Clostridium group formed by Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans, Dethiosulfovibrio peptidovorans, Anaerobaculum thermoterrenum and Aminobacterium colombiense, but the level of sequence similarity with the members of this cluster was not very high (87.6-92.2%). Among these organisms, Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans is phenotypically close to strain Z-9701T. However, the two organisms showed a relatively low level of similarity of their 16S rRNA sequences (92.2%) and of DNA-DNA hybridization (15 +/- 1%). Nevertheless, on the basis of the similar morphology and physiology of the new isolate and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans, strain Z-9701T was placed in the genus Thermanaerovibrio and a new species, Thermanaerovibrio velox, proposed for it. The type strain is Z-9701T (= DSM 12556T).
TI  - Clostridium peptidivorans sp. nov., a peptide-fermenting bacterium from an olive  mill wastewater treatment digester.
AB  - A new peptide-degrading, strictly anaerobic bacterium, designated strain TMC4T, was isolated from an olive mill wastewater treatment digester. Cells of strain TMC4T were motile, rod-shaped (5-10 x 0.6-1.2 microm), stained Gram-positive and formed terminal to subterminal spores that distended the cells. Optimal growth occurred at 37 degrees C and pH 7 in an anaerobic basal medium containing 0.5% Casamino acids. Arginine, lysine, cysteine, methionine, histidine, serine, isoleucine, yeast extract, peptone, Biotrypcase, gelatin and crotonate also supported growth, but not carbohydrates, organic acids or alcohols. The end-products of degradation were: acetate and butyrate from lysine and crotonate; acetate, butyrate, H2 and CO2 from Biotrypcase, gelatin and peptone; acetate, alanine, H2 and CO2 from cysteine; acetate, H2 and CO2 from serine, cysteine and yeast extract; acetate and formate from histidine; propionate from methionine; methyl 2-butyrate, H2 and CO2 from isoleucine; acetate and ethanol from arginine; and acetate, propionate, butyrate, methyl 2-butyrate, H2 and CO2 from Casamino acids. The DNA G+C content of strain TMC4T was 31 mol%. Phylogeny based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that strain TMC4T was a member of the low-G+C-content Gram-positive genus Clostridium, with the closest relative being Clostridium pascui (sequence similarity of 96 %). Due to considerable differences in genomic and phenotypic properties between strain TMC4T and those of its nearest relative, strain TMC4T is proposed as a new species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium peptidivorans sp. nov. Strain TMC4T has been deposited in the DSMZ as strain DSM 12505T.
TI  - Assignment of Eubacterium sp. VPI 12708 and related strains with high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity to Clostridium scindens and proposal of Clostridium hylemonae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Unknown Eubacterium-like organisms VPI 12708 and five strains (Y-1113, I-10, M-18, TH-82 and 36S) had high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity; the unknown Clostridium-like organisms TN-271T and TN-272 also had the same activity. Analysis of their 16S rDNA sequences demonstrated that all strains belong to cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium (Collins et al., 1994). Strain VPI 12708 and five other strains (Y-1113, I-10, M-18, TH-82 and 36S) formed a single cluster and strains TN-271T and TN-272 formed another single cluster. Clostridium scindens JCM 6567T was the most closely related species for two clusters in the phylogenetic tree. Values for DNA-DNA similarities among C. scindens JCM 6567T, strain VPI 12708 and the other five strains were greater than 70%, showing that these micro-organisms were a single species. Therefore, we identified strain VPI 12708 and the five other strains as C. scindens. In addition, DNA-DNA similarities among C. scindens JCM 6567T, strain TN-271T and strain N-272 revealed that strains TN-271T and TN-272 were distinct from C. scindens JCM 6567T. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA similarity data, it was concluded that strains TN-271T and TN-272 are members of a new species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium hylemonae is proposed. The type strain is strain TN-271T (= JCM 10539T).
TI  - Antibiotic therapy attenuates colitis in interleukin 10 gene-deficient mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interleukin (IL)-10 gene-deficient mice, raised under germfree conditions, do not develop colitis, implying a role for bacteria. This study mapped the appearance of luminal colonic bacteria and, using antibiotic treatment, determined their association with colitis in IL-10 gene-deficient mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with ciprofloxacin or with neomycin and metronidazole. The intestine was harvested for histological scoring and bacterial assessment. RESULTS: At 2 weeks of age, before the development of colitis, IL-10 gene-deficient mice demonstrated an earlier appearance of Streptococcus and Clostridium sp., and had a greater proportion (P < 0.01) of bacteria adherent to the colonic mucosa. This pattern of increased adherent bacteria persisted for the 12 weeks of study. Treatment of mice before the onset of colonic inflammation, with either antibiotic regime, reduced mucosal adherent bacteria and prevented colitis (P < 0.01). In contrast, treatment of established colitis with neomycin and metronidazole did not reduce adherent bacterial levels, yet was more efficacious (P < 0.05) in treating established colitis than ciprofloxacin, which did reduce adherent colonic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: In the IL-10 gene-deficient mouse model, the appearance and number of mucosal adherent colonic bacteria are altered before the onset of colitis. Antibiotics both prevent and treat the colitis through correction of this primary bacterial alteration.
TI  - Phylogenic and phenotypic characterization of some Eubacterium-like isolates from human feces: description of Solobacterium moorei Gen. Nov., Sp. Nov.
AB  - Three isolated strains from human feces were characterized by biochemical tests and 16S rDNA analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolated strains were members of the Clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria. The phenotypic characters resembled those of the genus Eubacterium, but these strains were shown to be phylogenetically distant from the type species of the genus, Eubacterium limosum. The strains showed a specific phylogenetic association with Holdemania filiformis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Based on a 16S rDNA sequence divergence of greater than 12% with H. filiformis and E. rhusiopathiae, a new genus, Solobacterium, is proposed for three strains, with one species, Solobacterium moorei. The type strain of Solobacterium moorei is JCM 10645T.
TI  - Clostridium gasigenes sp. nov., a psychrophile causing spoilage of vacuum-packed  meat.
AB  - Two psychrophilic Clostridium strains, DB1AT and R26, were isolated from incidences of 'blown-pack' spoilage of vacuum-packed chilled lamb. Vacuum packs of meat inoculated with these strains developed gas bubbles and pack distension within 14 d storage at 2 degrees C. The two main gases responsible for pack distension were carbon dioxide and hydrogen. 1-Butanol, butyric and acetic acid and butyl esters were the major volatile compounds produced by the strains in the artificially inoculated packs. The unknown strains were Gram-positive motile rods producing elliptical subterminal spores during the late-stationary growth phase. At pH 7.0, they grew from -1.5 to 26 degrees C, and their optimum growth temperature was 20-22 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, the pH range for growth was 5.4-8.9 and the optimum pH for growth was 6.2-8.6. In peptone/yeast extract broth, the organisms grew little or not at all in the absence of fermentable carbohydrates. Both strains hydrolysed gelatin, aesculin and starch. The fermentation products formed in peptone yeast extract glucose starch broth were ethanol, acetate, butyrate, lactate, butanol, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The G+C contents of the DNA of strains DB1AT and R26 were 29.4 and 28.3 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the strains belong to cluster I of the genus Clostridium (sensu Collins et al. 1994). The new strains differed from the phylogenetically related clostridia in cellular fatty acid composition, soluble protein profiles and phenotypic properties. On the basis of rDNA analysis and phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization, the strains were assigned to a new species for which the name Clostridium gasigenes is proposed. Strain DB1AT (= DSM 12272T) is designated as the type strain.
TI  - Clostridium akagii sp. nov. and Clostridium acidisoli sp. nov.: acid-tolerant, N2-fixing clostridia isolated from acidic forest soil and litter.
AB  - Two anaerobic acid-tolerant bacteria, CK58T and CK74T, were isolated from acidic  beech litter and acidic peat-bog soil, respectively. Both bacteria were spore-forming, motile rods with peritrichous flagella. The capacity to sporulate decreased with prolonged cultivation. Cells of CK58T formed chains or aggregates and were linked by a connecting filament that consisted of a core and a surrounding sheath. Cellobiose, glucose, xylose, arabinose, maltose, mannose and salicin supported growth of CK58T. These substrates, as well as mannitol, lactose, sucrose, glycerol, melezitose, raffinose and rhamnose, supported growth of CK74T. Sorbitol, trehalose, H2/CO2, CO/CO2, vanillate, Casamino acids, peptone, and various purines and pyrimidines did not support the growth of either organism. Growth of CK58T and CK74T on glucose yielded butyrate, lactate, acetate, formate, H2 and CO2 as end products. Growth of CK58T and CK74T was observed at pH 3.7-7.1 and 3.6-6.9, respectively. CK58T and CK74T grew in nitrogen-free medium at pH 3.7 under an N2 atmosphere and reduced acetylene at rates approximating 1 nmol min-1 (mg protein)-1. CK58T and CK74T did not contain carbon monoxide dehydrogenase or cytochromes, produce methane, or dissimilate nitrate or sulfate. Thus, CK58T and CK74T were characterized as nonacetogenic, N2-fixing, fermentative chemo-organotrophs. The G + C contents of CK58T and CK74T were 31.4 and 30.7 mol%, respectively. CK58T and CK74T were phylogenetically most closely related to Clostridium pasteurianum. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of CK58T and CK74T to C. pasteurianum and each other did not exceed 96.5%, and it is proposed that strains CK58T and CK74T be named Clostridium akagii CK58T (DSM 12554T) and Clostridium acidisoli CK74T (DSM 12555T), respectively. These results suggest that previously uncharacterized clostridial species reside and might fix N2 in the annoxic microzones of acidic forest soil and litter.
TI  - Clostridium algidixylanolyticum sp. nov., a psychrotolerant, xylan-degrading, spore-forming bacterium.
AB  - A psychrotolerant Clostridium species was isolated from vacuum-packed, temperature-abused raw lamb. Colonies of this micro-organism on sheep-blood agar were circular with an entire margin, grey-white, translucent and beta-haemolytic. Cells were single, tapered, motile rods. Elliptical subterminal spores were produced in the late stationary growth phase. Spores did not cause swelling of the maternal cells. The micro-organism was obligately anaerobic. In peptone yeast extract glucose starch (PYGS) broth at pH 7.0, the micro-organism grew optimally between 25.5 and 30.0 degrees C. The temperature range for growth was 2.5-32.2 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, the micro-organism grew optimally at pH 6.8 to 7.0. The pH range for anaerobic growth was 4.7-9.1. The micro-organism was saccharoclastic, hydrolysed starch and degraded xylan. The fermentation products formed in PYGS broth were acetate, formate, lactate, ethanol, butyrate, butanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The G + C content of the DNA was 38.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the strain belongs to cluster XIVa of the genus Clostridium (sensu Collins et al. 1994). The new strain differed from phylogenetically related clostridia in terms of cellular fatty acid composition, soluble protein profiles and phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characterization data, the strain was assigned to a new species, namely Clostridium algidixylanolyticum. The type strain is strain SPL73T (= DSM 12273T).
TI  - Modeling and optimization of anaerobic digested sludge converting starch to hydrogen.
AB  - The pH and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of a chemostat reactor were varied according to a central composite design methodology with the aim of modeling and optimizing the conversion of starch into hydrogen by microorganisms in an anaerobic digested sludge. Experimental results from 23 runs indicate that a maximum hydrogen production rate of 1600 L/m(3)/d under the organic loading rate of 6 kg starch m(3)/d obtained at pH = 5.2 and HRT = 17 h. Throughout this study, the hydrogen percentage in the biogas was approximately 60% and no methanogenesis was observed. while the reactor was operated with HRT of 17 h, hydrogen was produced within a pH range between 4.7 and 5.7. Alcohol production rate was greater than hydrogen production rate if the pH was lower than 4.3 or higher than 6.1. Supplementary experiments confirm that the optimum conditions evaluated in this study were highly reliable; while a hydrogen production yield of 1.29 l H(2)/g starch-COD was obtained. An examination of the response surfaces, including hydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alcohols production, led us to the belief that clostridium sp. predominated in the anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms in this study. Experiment results obtained emphasize that the response of metabolites was a more useful indicator than hydrogenic activity for obtaining efficient hydrogen production. Furthermore, expressions of contour plots indicate that Response-Surface Methodology may provide easily interpretable advice on the operation of a hydrogen-producing bioprocess.
TI  - High-level expression of tetanus toxin fragment C-thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An insert of Clostridium tetani DNA corresponding to fragment C of tetanus toxin  was amplified by PCR. This 1.4 kb fragment was cloned into the high-expression vector pET32a, under control of the T7 promoter. Expression of this plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) resulted in the production of a fusion protein ( approximately 62 kDa) consisting of 112 amino acids of thioredoxin and approximately 450 amino acids of fragment C. This fusion protein was recognized by anti-tetanus toxoid antiserum in an ELISA and on immunoblots. The recombinant fragment-C-thioredoxin protein was purified significantly in one step by Ni(2+)-chelate Sepharose, the final yield being approximately 35 mg/l. Immunization of animals with the recombinant protein produced antibodies that were able to recognize the tetanus toxin. By using this gene-fusion expression system we produced soluble fragment C of tetanus toxin in a high yield, preventing many problems inherent in the use of other expression systems that produce either insoluble fragment C in inclusion bodies, or a soluble form, but in low yield, using E. coli as the expression host.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - The role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  - The use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. Probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. There is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. However, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. Currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium sp. However, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., Bacillus sp., Propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. Some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. Probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including Clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Shigella, Salmonella, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. Probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. There are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. Probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.
TI  - Coprobacillus catenaformis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new genus and species isolated  from human feces.
AB  - Three strains of Eubacterium-like isolates from human feces were characterized by biochemical tests and 16S rDNA analysis. The phenotypic characteristics of the three strains resembled those of the genus Collinsella transferred from the genus Eubacterium recently. However, Eubacterium-like strains were phylogenetically members of the Clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, and these showed a specific phylogenetic association with Clostridium ramosum and C. spiroforme. C. ramosum and C. spiroforme are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that belong to the genus Clostridium, and the G + C contents are 26.0 and 27.4 mol%, respectively. However, the three Eubacterium-like strains had G + C contents of 32.1 to 33.1 mol% and were non-spore-forming rods. Based on phenotypic characteristics, we can differentiate these species, and furthermore, a 16S rDNA sequence divergence of greater than 9% with a new related genus, Coprobacillus, is proposed for the three strains, with one species, Coprobacillus catenaformis. The type strain of C. catenaformis is JCM 10604T.
TI  - Hasty effect on the metabolism of glycyrrhizin by Eubacterium sp. GLH with Ruminococcus sp. PO1-3 and Clostridium innocuum ES24-06 of human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Eubacterium sp. GLH with Ruminococcus sp. PO1-3 and Clostridium innocuum ES24-06  possessing enzymes involved in the metabolism of glycyrrhizin (GL) was cultured in GAM medium with and without 1.0 mM GL or 1.0 mM glycyrrhetic acid (GA). GL (1.0 mM) enhanced 3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate (3alpha-hydroxyGA) dehydrogenase activity, GA (1.0 mm) suppressed 3alpha-hydroxyGA dehydrogenase activity, GL beta-D-glucuronidase activity and the mixed bacterial growth, and GL and GA showed almost no change in a lower level of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) activity during 5 d of culture. GL (1.0 mM) and GA (1.0 mM) were metabolized to a small amount of GA and a negligible amount of 3-oxo-glycyrrhetic acid (3-oxo-GA) and 3alpha-hydroxyGA, and to a negligible amount of 3-oxo-GA, respectively, by these mixed bacteria. These amounts coincided with those of metabolites produced from 1.0 mM GL and 1.0 mM GA added to these mixed bacteria after 24 h culture. Whole bacteria and sonicated bacteria derived from the collection of these mixed bacteria reached a maximal stage and metabolized GL to a relatively large amount of GA and 3-oxo-GA, and a negligible amount of 3alpha-hydroxyGA and GA to a small amount of 3-oxo-GA and 3alpha-hydroxyGA within 180 min. GL beta-D-glucuronidase with 3beta-HSD and 3alpha-hydroxyGA dehydrogenase partially purified from each bacterium was converted GL to 3alpha-hydroxyGA, producing metabolites of about 60% after 10 min of incubation. These mixed bacteria possessed high enzyme activities could produce the metabolites of GL in under one hour under conditions.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation operon  in Clostridium sp. strain TO-931, a highly active 7alpha-dehydroxylating strain isolated from human feces.
AB  - Clostridium sp. strain TO-931 can rapidly convert the primary bile acid cholic acid to a potentially toxic compound, deoxycholic acid. Mixed oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate a gene fragment encoding a putative bile acid transporter from Clostridium sp. strain TO-931. This DNA fragment had 60% nucleotide sequence identity to a known bile acid transporter gene from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708, another bile acid-7alpha-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium. The DNA (9.15 kb) surrounding the transporter gene was cloned from Clostridium sp. strain TO-931 and sequenced. Within this larger DNA fragment was a 7.9-kb region, containing six successive open reading frames (ORFs), that was encoded by a single 8.1-kb transcript, as determined by Northern blot analysis. The gene arrangement and DNA sequence of the Clostridium sp. strain TO-931 operon are similar to those of a Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 bile acid-inducible operon containing nine ORFs. Several genes in the Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 operon have been shown to encode products required for bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation. In Clostridium sp. strain TO-931, genes potentially encoding bile acid-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, bile acid 7alpha-dehydratase, bile acid-CoA hydrolase, and a bile acid transporter were similar in size and exhibited amino acid homology to similar gene products from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 (encoded by baiB, baiA, baiE, baiF, and baiG, respectively). However, no genes similar to Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 biaH or baiI were found in the Clostridium sp. strain TO-931 bai operon, and the two putative Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 genes, baiC and baiD, were arranged in one continuous ORF in Clostridium sp. strain TO-931. Intergene regions showed no significant DNA sequence similarity, but primer extension analysis identified a region 115 bp upstream from the first ORF that exhibited 58% identity to a bai operator/promoter region identified in Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. These results indicate that the gene organization, gene product amino acid sequences, and promoters of the bile acid-inducible operons of Clostridium sp. strain TO-931 and Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 are highly conserved.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the gene for glucodextranase from Arthrobacter globiformis T-3044 and expression in Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - The gld gene for glucodextranase from Arthrobacter globiformis T-3044 was cloned  by using a combination of gene walking and probe methods and expressed on the recombinant plasmid pGD8, which was constructed with pUC118, in Escherichia coli cells. The enzyme gene consisted of a unique open reading frame of 3,153 bp. The comparison of the DNA sequence data with the N-terminal and 6 internal amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme secreted from A. globiformis T-3044 suggested the enzyme was translated from mRNA as a secretory precursor with a signal peptide of 28 amino acids residues. The deduced amino acids sequence of the mature enzyme contained 1,023 residues, resulting in a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 107,475 daltons. The deduced sequence showed about 38% identity to that of the glucoamylase from Clostridium sp. G0005. The glucodextranase activity of transformant harboring pGD8 was about 40 mU/ml at 30 degrees C for a 16-h culture. Although the GDase that was produced from the transformant was shorter than authentic GDase by 2 amino acid residues at the N-terminal end side, its enzymatic properties were almost same as the authentic one. Two kinds of genes, dex1 and dex2, for endo-dextranases from A. globiformis T-3044 were also cloned into Escherichia coli cells. The N-terminal of the purified endo-dextranase from A. globiformis T-3044 agreed with the deduced amino acid sequence, after the 33rd alanine residue, of only the dex1 gene for edo-dextranase. This result suggests that the endo-dextranase is translated from mRNA as a secretory precursor with a signal peptide of 32 amino acids residues. The deduced sequence of endo-dextranase 1 and endo-dextranase 2 showed about 93% and 65% identity with that of known endo-dextranase from Arthrobacter sp. CB-8, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial reduction of copper-contaminated ferric oxide: copper toxicity and the  interaction between fermentative and iron-reducing bacteria.
AB  - Fe(III) oxide is an important heavy-metal sink, and bacteria are responsible for  much of the Fe(III) reduced in nonsulfidogenic aquatic environments, yet factors governing the bacterial reduction of heavy metal-contaminated iron oxide are largely unknown. In this study with a stabilized bacterial consortium enriched from metal-contaminated sediments, we demonstrate that Cu toxicity impedes anaerobic carbon oxidation and bacterial reduction of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). In the enrichment culture, a Clostridium sp. fermented lactate to propionate and acetate and Fe(III) reducers coupled acetate oxidation to HFO reduction. Increasing the amount of Cu in the culture medium significantly extended the time before Fe(III) reduction occurred and decreased the reduction rate, but did not affect the extent of HFO reduction. The Clostridium had a higher Cu-complexation capacity than the Fe(III) reducer Shewanella alga. Iron reduction was inhibited until almost all of the dissolved Cu was removed from solution and occurred two to seven times faster if the sediment enrichment culture was fed lactate instead of acetate. Our findings suggest that fermentative bacteria play a role in ameliorating heavy metal toxicity to iron-reducing bacteria. Fermenters may therefore enhance metal release in sediments by facilitating the bacterial reductive dissolution of heavy metal-contaminated HFO.
TI  - [Results of treatment of deep neck abscesses and phlegmons].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neck, as a structure very closely connected with oral cavity and pharynx, with great number of lymph nodes, (about 2, 3 of all are in the neck), is sometimes a localization of purulent inflammatory process but its incidence is not so high as the incidence of inflammations of surrounding organs and tissue. Deep neck abscesses are localized under the upper fascial layer. They have a serious clinical picture which could be further complicated if inflammation spreads on vessels or neck organs. If the processes spread toward the mediastinum because of the communication space between medial and deep fascial layer with mediastinum, it could be mediastinal inflammation with high mortality. The aim of this study is evaluation of results of treatment in patients with deep neck abscesses and phlegmons treated at Clinic in a ten year period (1988-1997). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study comprised 21 patients who were treated at the ENT Clinic in Novi Sad during 1988-1997. The group consisted of 5 female and 16 male patients from one to 65 years of age. Sixteen (76.2%) patients were treated with antibiotics in general practice, and 5 were admitted without previous therapy, 8 patients were afebrile, with temperatures between 37-38 degrees C and 5 with fever and high temperature. In 17 patients 5 days passed from onset of symptoms to admittance at the Clinic, and 4 patients had enlarged neck lymph nodes a few months. Unknown primary site of infections were in 13 (61.9%) patients, that means abscesses developed as colliquation of inflammatory changed lymph node. In the rest of 8 patients abscesses developed as: oropharyngeal inflammation (4 patients), foreign body perforation of esophagus, chronic otitis media, neck injury, malignant lymphoma. Lateral side of the neck was the most frequent site of neck abscesses and phlegmon in 16 (76%) patients. Red skin over the abscesses didn't appear in 4 patients. In 2 patients neck emphysema developed: anaerobic inflammation in one patient and esophageal perforation in the second. In a patient with SE over the 50 per hour the length of the abscess was over 7 cm, and in those with SE over 100 per hour, the whole neck inflammed. All patients underwent surgical therapy between 24 to 48 h after admission with incision or excision of the abscesses. Pus was collected for culture during the incision or excision of the abscesses and phlegmon. Bacteria were discovered in specimens taken during the incision in 4 (19%) of patients. Different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated: Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus sp, Streptococcus viridans, Clostridium species. Surgery was the basic therapy of neck phlegmons and abscesses. In all patients incision was sutured in the second stage. Only one patient got paralysis of n. accesorius. One patient died with gas gangrene of the neck. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Deep neck abscesses and phlegmons are relatively rare inflammations in spite of high incidence of surrounding tissue inflammations. The most frequent causes are inflammatory changes of lymph nodes. Treatment has to be urgent, because of vital neck structures and communications between deep neck space and mediastinum. We consider that surgery is the basic principle of therapy although we have not had experience with needle aspiration. Antimicrobial agents must be given only parenterally.
TI  - NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase in the Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium Psychrobacter sp. TAD1. Characterization, protein and DNA sequence, and relationship to other glutamate dehydrogenases.
AB  - The Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 contains two distinct glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH), each specific for either NADP+ or NAD+. This feature is quite unusual in bacteria, which generally have a single GDH. NADP+-dependent GDH has been purified to homogeneity and the gene encoding GDH has been cloned and expressed. The enzyme has a hexameric structure. The amino acid sequence determined by peptide and gene analyses comprises 447 residues, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 49 285 Da. The sequence shows homology with hexameric GDHs, with identity levels of 52% and 49% with Escherichia coli and Clostridium symbiosum GDH, respectively. The coenzyme-binding fingerprint motif GXGXXG/A (common to all GDHs) has Ser at the last position in this enzyme. The overall hydrophilic character is increased and a five-residue insertion in a loop between two alpha-helices may contribute to the increase in protein flexibility. Psychrobacter sp. TAD1 GDH apparent temperature optimum is shifted towards low temperatures, whereas irreversible heat inactivation occurs at temperatures similar to those of E. coli GDH. The catalytic efficiency in the temperature range 10-30 degrees C is similar or lower than that of E. coli GDH. Unlike E. coli GDH the enzyme exhibits marked positive cooperativity towards 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH. This feature is generally absent in prokaryotic GDHs. These observations suggest a regulatory role for this GDH, the most crucial feature being the structural/functional properties required for fine regulation of activity, rather than the high catalytic efficiency and thermolability encountered in several cold-active enzymes.
TI  - Characterization of a new xylanolytic bacterium, Clostridium xylanovorans sp. nov.
AB  - A new xylanolytic bacterium designated strain HESP1T (T = type strain) was isolated from a methanogenic digester. Strain HESP1T was a motile, rod shaped, spore-forming bacterium, which possessed a Gram-positive type cell wall. Glucose, fructose, lactose, trehalose, maltose, raffinose, sucrose, xylan, mannitol, cellobiose, galactose, mannose, melibiose, ribose were fermented to produce, acetate, butyrate, H2, CO2, formate, isobutyrate, and ethanol. Fumarate was fermented to acetate. Glycerol and methanol were also utilized. Sulfate, thiosulfate, nitrate, sulfur and fumarate were not used as electron acceptors. Strain HESP1T had a G + C content of 40 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C and pH 7 on a fructose containing medium. Phylogenetically, strain HESP1T was most related to Clostridium aminovalericum (similarity of 94%) than to C. populeti, C. herbivorans and Eubacterium xylanophilum (average similarity of 92%), all members of subcluster XIVa of the low G + C containing Gram-positive branch. However, strain HESP1T shared little phenotypic and genotypic traits with C. aminovalericum and on the basis of this and phylogenetic evidence, we propose to tentatively designate strain HESP1T as a new species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium xylanovorans sp. nov. The type strain is HESP1T (= DSM 12503).
TI  - Bacteria associated with butterfly stain of Chilean tepa.
AB  - Butterfly stain, common in Chilean tepa (Laureliopsis philippiana [Looser] Schodde) trees, appears in cross-section of the stem as a series of partially overlapping orange-brown arcs that in early stages resembles a butterfly. Bacterial isolates from stained tepa wood samples cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were identified using several commercially available identification systems. Pseudomonas sp. were most common in the cultures handled aerobically, and Clostridium sp. were found in the cultures handled anaerobically. A pectynolitic Bacillus sp. and a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that emitted a strong naphthalene-like odor similar to that of stained wood were also isolated. Not all isolates could be identified. This the first report of Clostridium from tepa.
TI  - Characterization of pentocin TV35b, a bacteriocin-like peptide isolated from Lactobacillus pentosus with a fungistatic effect on Candida albicans.
AB  - Lactobacillus pentosus TV35b, isolated from the posterior fornix secretions of the vagina of a prenatal patient, produced a bacteriocin-like peptide (pentocin TV35b), which is inhibitory to Clostridium sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Lact. curvatus, Lact. fermentum, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp. and Candida albicans. The mechanism of activity of pentocin TV35b is bactericidal, as shown by a decrease in the viable cell numbers of Lact. sake from approximately 4 x 108 to less than 10 cfu ml - 1 over a period of 4 h. Pentocin TV35b added to the growth medium of C. albicans stimulated the formation of pseudohyphae during the first 36 h, followed by a slight repression in cell growth. Production of pentocin TV35b was at its maximum towards the end of the logarithmic growth phase of strain TV35b. The peptide was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography. The molecular size of pentocin TV35b was estimated to be between 2.35 and 3.4 kDa, according to tricine-SDS PAGE. However, results obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy indicated that the peptide is 3930.2 Da in size. Amino acid analysis performed by using the Pico-Tag(R) method and a Nova-Pak C18 HPLC column indicated that pentocin TV35b consists of 33 amino acids with a total mass of 3929.63 Da. Pentocin TV35b is inactivated when treated with papain and Proteinase K, but remains active after incubation at pH 1-10 for 2 h at 25 degrees C, and when heat-treated for 30 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - Clostridium frigidicarnis sp. nov., a psychrotolerant bacterium associated with 'blown pack' spoilage of vacuum-packed meats.
AB  - Two strains of a psychrotolerant Clostridium, isolated from vacuum-packed, temperature-abused beef, were characterized using a multiphasic approach. The strains were Gram-positive motile rods producing elliptical subterminal spores during early stationary growth phase. The strains were psychrotolerant. At pH 7.0, they grew between 3.8 and 40.5 degrees C; their optimum growth temperature was 30.0-38.5 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, the pH range for growth was between 4.7 and 9.5; the optimum pH for growth was 6.4-7.2. The organisms were proteolytic and saccharolytic, lecithinase-positive and hydrolysed gelatin. The fermentation products formed in peptone/yeast extract/glucose/starch broth were acetate, ethanol, butyrate, isovalerate, butanol, isobutyrate, oxalacetate, lactate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The DNA G + C compositions of the two meat strains were 27.3 and 28.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the strains belong to Cluster I of the genus Clostridium (sensu Collins et al., 1994). The new strains differed from phylogenetically related clostridia in terms of cellular fatty acid composition, soluble protein profiles and phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characterization data, the strains were assigned to a new species for which the name Clostridium frigidicarnis is proposed; strain SPL77AT (= DSM 12271T) is the type strain.
TI  - Characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2.
AB  - A 1,067-bp cDNA, designated axeA, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (AxeA) was  cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus Orpinomyces sp. strain PC-2. The gene had an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 Da. An active esterase using the original start codon of the cDNA was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant E. coli cultures. The size difference of 8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal peptide. The enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. The activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase A from the same fungus. Using p-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a K(m) of 0.9 mM and a V(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). It had temperature and pH optima of 30 degrees C and 9.0, respectively. AxeA had 56% amino acid identity with BnaA, an acetyl xylan esterase of Neocallimastix patriciarum, but the Orpinomyces AxeA was devoid of a noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (NCRPD) found at the carboxy terminus of the Neocallimastix BnaA. The NCRPD found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The difference in domain structures indicated that the two highly similar esterases of Orpinomyces and Neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. Sequence data indicate that AxeA and BnaA might represent a new family of hydrolases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Clostridium sp. with cinnamoyl esterase activity and unusual cell envelope ultrastructure.
AB  - Microorganisms that hydrolyse the ester linkages between phenolic acids and polysaccharides in plant cell walls are potential sources of enzymes for the degradation of lignocellulosic waste. An anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming, xylanolytic bacterium with high hydroxy cinnamic acid esterase activity was isolated from the gut of the grass-eating termite Tumilitermes pastinator. The bacterium was motile and rod-shaped, stained gram-positive, had an eight-layered cell envelope, and formed endospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA indicated that the bacterium is closely related to Clostridium xylanolyticum and is grouped with polysaccharolytic strains of clostridia. A wide range of carbohydrates were fermented, and growth was stimulated by either xylan or cellobiose as substrates. The bacterium hydrolysed and then hydrogenated the hydroxy cinnamic acids (ferulic and p-coumaric acids), which are esterified to arabinoxylan in plant cell walls. Three cytoplasmic enzymes with hydroxy cinnamic acid esterase activity were identified using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This bacterium possesses an unusual multilayered cell envelope in which both leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane, the peptidoglycan layer and the S layer are clearly discernible. The fate of all these components was easily followed throughout the endospore formation process. The peptidoglycan component persisted during the entire morphogenesis. It was seen to enter the septum and to pass with the engulfing membranes to surround the prespore. It eventually expanded to form the cortex, verification for the peptidoglycan origin of the cortex. Sporogenic vesicles, which are derived from the cell wall peptidoglycan, were associated with the engulfment process. Spore coat fragments appeared early, in stage II, though spore coat formation was not complete until after cortex formation.
TI  - [Development from actions of bacterial phospholipases C on eucaryotic plasma membranes to molecular biology of GPI-anchored proteins].
AB  - Bacterial phospholipases C are known to act on biomembranes, since they can cleave the phosphodiester linkage between the polar head and the hydrophobic moiety of each phospholipid in these membranes. These enzymes have been classified into three groups; phosphatidylcholine (PC)-, sphingomyelin (SM)- and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-degrading phospholipases C. Enzymatic properties and toxicities of these phospholipases C are reviewed, in relation to author's research. Studies on the hemolytic phospholipases of Clostridium sp., Bacillus cereus etc., revealed that hydrolysis of choline-containing phospholipids such as PC and SM was responsible for the hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by these enzymes in the presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+. Also, the studies on a structure-activity correlation of SM-hydrolyzing phospholipase C from B. cereus disclosed the similarity of active sites between this enzyme and bovine pancreatic DNase I. By action of PI-degrading phospholipases C, several membrane proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, VSG (protozoal surface glycoprotein) etc., were shown to be released from the plasma membranes of eucaryotic cells. From structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins bound to the plasma membranes with carboxyl terminal-attached glycolipid. Biochemistry and molecular biology of GPI-anchored proteins, including the structures and biosynthetic routes of GPI glycolipids as well as the process of GPI attachment to proteins, requirements of C-terminal signal peptide for the protein modification by GPI, and distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in living world, are described in relation to our studies.
TI  - Clostridium methoxybenzovorans sp. nov., a new aromatic o-demethylating homoacetogen from an olive mill wastewater treatment digester.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium (3.0-5.0 x 0.4-0.8 microns), designated strain SR3T (T = type strain), which stained Gram-positive and possessed a Gram-positive type cell wall was isolated from a methanogenic pilot-scale digester fed with olive mill wastewater (Sfax, Tunisia). It utilized a number of carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sorbose, galactose, myo-inositol, sucrose, lactose, cellobiose), organic compounds (lactate, betaine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide), alcohol (methanol) and all methoxylated aromatic compounds only in the presence of yeast extract (0.1%). The end products from carbohydrate fermentation were H2, CO2, formate, acetate and ethanol, that from lactate was methanol, those from methoxylated aromatics were acetate and butyrate, and that from betaine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine, methanethiol and dimethylsulfide was only acetate. Strain SR3T was non-motile, had a G+C content of 44 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 on a glucose-containing medium. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of strain SR3T were the non-methoxylated aromatic-degrading Clostridium xylanolyticum, Clostridium aerotolerans, Clostridium sphenoides and Clostridium celerecrescens (mean similarity of 98%). On the basis of the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolate, it is proposed to designate strain SR3T as Clostridium methoxybenzovorans sp. nov. The type strain is SR3T (= DSM 12182T).
TI  - Fusibacter paucivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, thiosulfate-reducing bacterium from an oil-producing well.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, halotolerant, spindle-shaped rod, designated strain SEBR 4211T, was isolated from an African saline oil-producing well. Cells stain Gram-positive, which was confirmed by electron microscopy observations. Strain SEBR 4211T was motile by means of one to four peritrichous flagella, had a G+C content of 43 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7.3, with 0 to 3% (w/v) NaCl. It utilized a limited number of carbohydrates (cellobiose, glucose, fructose, mannitol and ribose) and produced acetate, butyrate, CO2 and H2 as end products from glucose fermentation. It reduced thiosulfate to sulfide. In the presence of thiosulfate, a decrease in butyrate and an increase in acetate production was observed. Phylogenetically, strain SEBR 4211T was related to members of the low G+C Clostridiales order with Clostridium halophilum as the closest relative (16S rDNA sequence similarity of 90%). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolate, it is proposed to designate it as a new species of a new genus, Fusibacter gen. nov., as Fusibacter paucivorans sp. nov. The type strain is SEBR 4211T (= DSM 12116T).
TI  - Fermentative bacteria from estuarine mud: phylogenetic position of Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans and description of a new type of gram-negative, propionigenic bacterium as Propionibacter pelophilus gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - The phylogenetic positions of two strains of fermentative bacteria that had been  isolated from the highest positive tubes inoculated with serial dilutions of estuarine mud in agar media with either glutamate or aspartate as substrate were determined by comparative sequence analysis of their 16S rRNA genes. The strain isolated with glutamate (glu 65) utilized several substrates, including a number of amino acids but no sugars. The degradation of certain substrates was enhanced by or dependent upon co-cultivation with a hydrogen-utilizing partner. In earlier work this strain was assigned to the new genus and species Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans. On the basis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans has now been identified as a member of cluster XI of the Clostridium subphylum with Clostridium halophilum as its closest relative. The aspartate-fermenting strain asp 66T was a Gram-negative, rather aerotolerant anaerobe which utilized a wide range of substrates in a propionic fermentation and had the ability to fix molecular nitrogen. Strain asp 66T was shown to be a new member of the beta-subclass of the Proteobacteria with Azoarcus sp. strain 6a3 and Rhodocyclus tenuis as its closest relatives. It is described as Propionibacter pelophilus gen. nov., sp. nov., with the type strain asp 66T (= DSM 12018T).
TI  - An indigo-reducing moderate thermophile from a woad vat, Clostridium isatidis sp. nov.
AB  - A Gram-positive, anaerobic, moderate thermophile, strain Wv6T, capable of reducing indigo dye, was isolated from a fermenting woad vat prepared essentially as in medieval Europe. Strain Wv6T formed rod-shaped cells, which occurred singly, in pairs or in chains and produced terminal oval endospores. Strain Wv6T was saccharolytic. Growth occurred at pH 5.9-9.9 (initial pH) with an optimum at 50 degrees C of pH 7.2 +/- 0.2 (constant pH). At pH 7.8, the temperature range for growth was 30-55 degrees C with the optimum at 49-52 degrees C. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the bacterium represents a hitherto unknown subline within rRNA cluster I Clostridium. Based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic criteria, it is proposed that the unknown moderate thermophile should be classified as Clostridium isatidis sp. nov., a new species of the genus Clostridium. The type strain of Clostridium isatidis is strain Wv6T (= NCFB 3071T).
TI  - Fate of Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, and microbial indicators during wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion.
AB  - The extent of reduction in selected microorganisms was tested during both aerobic wastewater treatment and anaerobic digestion of sludge at the wastewater treatment plant in Ottawa to compare the removal of two encysted pathogenic protozoa with that of microbial indicators. Samples collected included the raw wastewater, the primary effluent, the treated wastewater, the mixed sludge, the decanted liquor, and the cake. All of the raw sewage samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, as well as for the other microorganisms tested. During aerobic wastewater treatment (excluding the anaerobic sludge digestion), Cryptosporidium and Giardia were reduced by 2.96 log10 and 1.40 log10, respectively. Clostridium perfringens spores, Clostridium perfringens total counts, somatic coliphages, and heterotrophic bacteria were reduced by approximately 0.89 log10, 0.96 log10, 1.58 log10, and 2.02 log10, respectively. All of the other microorganisms were reduced by at least 3.53 log10. Sludge samples from the plant were found to contain variable densities of microorganisms. Variability in microbial concentrations was sometimes great between samples, stressing the importance of collecting a large number of samples over a long period of time. In all cases, the bacterial concentrations in the cake (dewatered biosolids) samples were high even if reductions in numbers were observed with some bacteria. During anaerobic sludge digestion, no statistically significant reduction was observed for Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus sp., Cryptosporidium oocysts, and Giardia cysts. A 1-2 log10 reduction was observed with fecal coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria. However, the method utilized to detect the protozoan parasites does not differentiate between viable and nonviable organisms. On the other hand, total coliforms and somatic coliphages were reduced by 0.35 log10 and 0.09 log10, respectively. These results demonstrate the relative persistence of the protozoa in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment.
TI  - Study of the presence of the spores of Clostridium botulinum in honey in Brazil.
AB  - The isolation of Clostridium botulinum from honey samples is described. Botulism  is characterized as an intoxication provoked by ingestion of contaminated foods with this toxin. Infant botulism happens by the ingestion of spores of C. botulinum together with food that in special conditions of the intestinal tract, such as those present in babies of less than 1 year old, will allow the germination and colonization of the intestine with production and absorption of botulinic toxin. The samples were subjected to dilution and to a thermal shock and cultivated in modified CMM (Difco). Cultures were subjected to Gram smears and toxicity tests in mice. The toxic cultures were purified in RFCA (Oxoid) plates and incubated in anaerobic jars. Positive samples were typed using the mouse assay neutralization test. From the 85 honey samples analyzed, six were positive for C. botulinum (7.06%), and identified as producers of type A, B, and D toxins.
TI  - Characterization, production, and purification of leucocin H, a two-peptide bacteriocin from Leuconostoc MF215B.
AB  - Leuconostoc MF215B was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin H. The two peptides were termed leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta. When acting together, they inhibit, among others, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Production of leucocin H in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees C and at pH below 7. The highest activity of leucocin H in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential growth phase. The bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (SP Sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. Upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) BU/OD280. Amino acid composition analyses of leucocin Halpha and leucocin Hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. Their N-termini were blocked for Edman degradation, and the methionin residues of leucocin Hbeta did not respond to Cyanogen Bromide (CNBr) cleavage. Absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by Edman degradation. From leucocin Halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin Hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. No sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. It also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. The presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin H in agar.
TI  - Family 10 and 11 xylanase genes from Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain Rt69B.1.
AB  - Three family 10 xylanase genes (xynA, xynB, and xynC) and a single family 11 xylanase gene (xynD) were identified from the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt69B.1 through the use of consensus PCR in conjunction with sequencing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These genes appear to comprise the complete endoxylanase system of Rt69B.1. The xynA gene was found to be homologous to the xynA gene of the closely related Caldicellulosiruptor strain Rt8B.4, and primers designed previously to amplify the Rt8B.4 xynA gene could amplify homologous full-length xynA gene fragments from Rt69B.1. The complete nucleotide sequences of the Rt69B.1 xynB, xynC, and xynD genes were obtained using genomic walking PCR. The full-length xynB and xynC genes are more than 5 kb in length and encode highly modular enzymes that are the largest xylanases reported to date. XynB has an architecture similar to the family 10 xylanases from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (XynA) and Clostridium thermocellum (XynX) and may be cell wall associated, while XynC is a bifunctional enzyme with an architecture similar to the bifunctional beta-glycanases from Caldicellulosiroptor saccharolyticus. The xynD gene encodes a two-domain family 11 xylanase that is identical in architecture to the XynB family 11 xylanase from the unrelated extreme thermophile Dictyoglomus thermophilum strain Rt46B.1. The sequence similarities between the Rt69B.1 xylanases with respect to their evolution are discussed.
TI  - The energy conserving methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M methyltransferase  complex from methanogenic archaea: function of the subunit MtrH.
AB  - In methanogenic archaea the transfer of the methyl group of N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M is coupled with energy conservation. The reaction is catalyzed by a membrane associated multienzyme complex composed of eight different subunits MtrA-H. The 23 kDa subunit MtrA harbors a corrinoid prosthetic group which is methylated and demethylated in the catalytic cycle. We report here that the 34 kDa subunit MtrH catalyzes the methylation reaction. MtrH was purified and shown to exhibit methyltetrahydromethanopterin:cob(I)alamin methyltransferase activity. Sequence comparison revealed similarity of MtrH with MetH from Escherichia coli and AcsE from Clostridium thermoaceticum: both enzymes exhibit methyltetrahydrofolate:cob(I)alamin methyltransferase activity.
TI  - Thermaerobacter marianensis gen. nov., sp. nov., an aerobic extremely thermophilic marine bacterium from the 11,000 m deep Mariana Trench.
AB  - A novel extremely thermophilic bacterium was isolated from the world's deepest sea-floor, the Mariana Trench Challenger Deep at a depth of 10,897 m. Cells were Gram-reaction variable, non-spore-forming and non-motile rods without flagella. Growth was observed between 50 and 80 degrees C (optimum: 74-76 degrees C; 90 min doubling time), pH 5.4 and 9.5 (optimum: pH 7.0-7.5) and 0.5 and 5% sea salts (optimum: 2% sea salts). The isolate was a strictly aerobic heterotroph capable of utilizing as sole energy and carbon source: yeast extract, peptone, cellulose, starch, chitin, casein, Casamino acids, a variety of sugars, carboxylic acids and amino acids. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 72.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences placed this aerobic, high-G + C-content bacterium among the members of the Gram-positive, low-G + C-content anaerobic thermophilic bacteria within the Bacillus-Clostridium subphylum. On the basis of the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolate, the name Thermaerobacter marianensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain 7p75aT = JCM 10246T) is proposed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Comparative activity of eighteen antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria  isolated in South Africa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 18 antimicrobial agents was determined against 378 anaerobic bacteria isolated in Bloemfontein, South Africa, during 1996/97. Against the gram-positive isolates, MICs of penicillin and cefoxitin were >0.5 microg/ml and >16 microg/ml, respectively, for five and three strains of non-perfringens Clostridium spp. Seventeen Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains were resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 microg/ml). All gram-positive anaerobes tested except one Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium sp. were susceptible to dalfopristin-quinupristin (MICs < or = 1 microg/ml). The carbapenems exhibited excellent activity against the gram-positive isolates and were effective against most gram-negative anaerobes, with the exception of the fusobacteria. Only seven strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to trovafloxacin (MICs > 2 microg/ml). In mixed anaerobic/aerobic infections, carbapenems and the fourth-generation quinolone trovafloxacin were the agents most suitable for us as broad-spectrum monotherapy.
TI  - Keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans in murine eosinophil-specific granules.
AB  - We examined the presence of sialyl glycoconjugates in specific granules from murine bone marrow eosinophils. Lectin cytochemistry using Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) specific for sialyl alpha-2,3 galactose residues demonstrated positive labeling in both immature and mature specific granules. Pretreatment with Clostridium neuraminidase or keratanase II eliminated the positive labeling of MAL II in the specific granules. High iron diamine-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate physical development (HID-TCH-SP-PD) staining, which is specific for sulfated glycoconjugates, also positively labeled immature specific granules lacking crystalloids but not mature granules with crystalloids. Pretreatment with a combination of chondroitinase ABC and keratanase, or a combination of chondroitinase ABC and keratanase II, eliminated the positive labeling obtained with HID-TCH-SP-PD. These results indicate that the sialyl residues detected by MAL II are expressed as terminal sugar residues of keratan sulfate proteoglycan, which appears to be of the corneal type in view of its sensitivity to keratanase and keratanase II. (J Histochem Cytochem 47:481-488, 1999)
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - The effect of probiotic strains on the microbiota of the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME).
AB  - The aim of the present work was to study five potential probiotic strains (Lactobacillus plantarum, two strains of L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium sp.) comparatively in the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) in vitro model, and to evaluate this model as a tool in the screening and selection of probiotic bacteria. The impact of the strains on the composition of microbiota and its metabolic activities (production of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids) was studied. Changes in composition of the microbiota become apparent as a result of probiotic treatment. A marked, but temporary, increase was noted in the number of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. The profiles of D(-) and L(+) isomers of lactic acid detected in the SHIME after addition of probiotic strains corresponded well to those that are produced in pure culture conditions. The numbers of enterobacteriaceae decreased markedly and those of clostridia detectably during the intervention, while the enterococci tended to increase after the treatment. This pattern was similar in the reactors representing both the small and large intestine in the model. The changes in short-chain fatty acids were small, and no definite trend was observed.
TI  - Activation of G12/G13 results in shape change and Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated myosin  light chain phosphorylation in mouse platelets.
AB  - Platelets respond to various stimuli with rapid changes in shape followed by aggregation and secretion of their granule contents. Platelets lacking the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq do not aggregate and degranulate but still undergo shape change after activation through thromboxane-A2 (TXA2) or thrombin receptors. In contrast to thrombin, the TXA2 mimetic U46619 led to the selective activation of G12 and G13 in Galphaq-deficient platelets indicating that these G proteins mediate TXA2 receptor-induced shape change. TXA2 receptor-mediated activation of G12/G13 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72(syk) and stimulation of pp60(c-src) as well as in phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in Galphaq-deficient platelets. Both MLC phosphorylation and shape change induced through G12/G13 in the absence of Galphaq were inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and by cAMP-analogue Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS. These data indicate that G12/G13 couple receptors to tyrosine kinases as well as to the Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated regulation of MLC phosphorylation. We provide evidence that G12/G13-mediated Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent regulation of MLC phosphorylation participates in receptor-induced platelet shape change.
TI  - Oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  - CONTEXT: The oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. OBJECTIVE: To compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. PATIENTS: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. SETTING: Santa Casa de Sao Paulo Emergency Service. DESIGN: A blind prospective study. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. RESULTS: The study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: Bacteroides sp, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium sp, Veilonella sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, Propionibacterium sp, Bifidobacterium sp and Clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. Candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). Enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. Infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.
TI  - [Carbohydrate adaptive substance for prophylaxis of immune disorders and correction of dysbacterioses].
AB  - Effects of a new preparation, adaptokhit, on the intestinal microbiocenosis and some parameters of immune resistance were studied in Macaque rhesus during 13-day hypokinesia. Experimental animals were given adaptokhit as an alimentary supplement preventing dysbiotic consequences of the microecologic unbalance due to motor restraint. Results of the investigation showed certain distinctions in the intestinal microflora in the experimental and control animals as early as on day three of the experiment. Intestinal microflora of the experimental primates who daily consumed adaptokhit at 50 mg/kg of the body remained stable throughout the period of observation. In contrast, in their controls lactoflora was found to decrease in parallel to the growth of opportunistically pathogenic endobacteria including representatives of Proteus and Clostridia sp., and development of dysbacteriosis of categories II and III. Besides, in the experimental animals adaptokhit prevented decline in the proliferative activity of lymphocytes further into adaptation. Also, at the final stage of observation following canceling the preparation there were signs of normalization of the allergologic status of primates in the experimental group. Therefore, adaptokhit can be used as an alimentary supplement to strengthen the colony resistance of animals in extreme conditions.
TI  - Chronic diarrhoea among HIV-infected adult patients in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of AIDS in Africa. However, because of resource constraints few comprehensive aetiological studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoea; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. METHODS: Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoea admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichia coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X2 = 5.2, P<0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 28%) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis; and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. Further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.
TI  - Molecular composition of the 16S toxin produced by a Clostridium botulinum type D strain, 1873.
AB  - The 16S toxin was purified from a Clostridium botulinum type D strain 1873 (D-1873). Furthermore, the entire nucleotide sequences of the genes coding for the 16S toxin were determined. It became clear that the purified D-1873 16S toxin consists of neurotoxin, nontoxic nonhemagglutinin (NTNH), and hemagglutinin (HA), and that HA consists of four subcomponents, HA1, HA2, HA3a, and HA3b, the same as type D strain CB16 (D-CB16) 16S toxin. The nucleotide sequences of the nontoxic components of these two strains were also found to be identical except for several bases. However, the culture supernatant and the purified 16S toxin of D-1873 showed little HA activity, unlike D-CB16, though the fractions successively eluted after the D-1873 16S toxin peak from an SP-Toyopearl 650S column showed a low level of HA activity. The main difference between D-1873 and D-CB16 HA molecules was the mobility of the HA1 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Therefore it was presumed that the loss of HA activity of D-1873 16S toxin might be caused by the differences of processing HA after the translation.
TI  - Evidence for a bacteriocin-like substance produced by a new strain of Streptococcus sp., inhibitory to gram-positive food-borne pathogens.
AB  - A new strain of Streptococcus sp. (CNCM I-841) isolated from a commercial probiotic product was shown to be antagonistic towards several food-borne pathogens including Clostridium sp. and Listeria monocytogenes. This strain produced and excreted an antibacterial substance in MRS broth. The inhibitory substance was different from hydrogen peroxide, since it was unaffected by catalase. It was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, indicating that the active moiety of the inhibitor was proteinaceous in nature, and it had no effect on its producer strain. These properties suggested that the inhibitory substance could be considered as a bacteriocin-like substance. The antimicrobial substance was also produced in M17 and tryptose broths if they were supplemented with Tween-80. Partial purification allowed a 10.5-fold increase in the specific activity. A preliminary characterization showed that it was active against lactobacilli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sp. and Listeria sp. It was not affected by 2-h treatment at 60 degrees C, but was sensitive to treatments at 100 degrees C and to autoclaving at 121 degrees C. The activity was not affected by treatments at pH values ranging from 2 to 11.
TI  - Characterization of a defined 2,3,5, 6-tetrachlorobiphenyl-ortho-dechlorinating microbial community by comparative sequence analysis of genes coding for 16S rRNA.
AB  - Defined microbial communities were developed by combining selective enrichment with molecular monitoring of total community genes coding for 16S rRNAs (16S rDNAs) to identify potential polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-dechlorinating anaerobes that ortho dechlorinate 2,3, 5,6-tetrachlorobiphenyl. In enrichment cultures that contained a defined estuarine medium, three fatty acids, and sterile sediment, a Clostridium sp. was predominant in the absence of added PCB, but undescribed species in the delta subgroup of the class Proteobacteria, the low-G+C gram-positive subgroup, the Thermotogales subgroup, and a single species with sequence similarity to the deeply branching species Dehalococcoides ethenogenes were more predominant during active dechlorination of the PCB. Species with high sequence similarities to Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales archaeal subgroups were predominant in both dechlorinating and nondechlorinating enrichment cultures. Deletion of sediment from PCB-dechlorinating enrichment cultures reduced the rate of dechlorination and the diversity of the community. Substitution of sodium acetate for the mixture of three fatty acids increased the rate of dechlorination, further reduced the community diversity, and caused a shift in the predominant species that included restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns not previously detected. Although PCB-dechlorinating cultures were methanogenic, inhibition of methanogenesis and elimination of the archaeal community by addition of bromoethanesulfonic acid only slightly inhibited dechlorination, indicating that the archaea were not required for ortho dechlorination of the congener. Deletion of Clostridium spp. from the community profile by addition of vancomycin only slightly reduced dechlorination. However, addition of sodium molybdate, an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited dechlorination and deleted selected species from the community profiles of the class Bacteria. With the exception of one 16S rDNA sequence that had the highest sequence similarity to the obligate perchloroethylene-dechlorinating Dehalococcoides, the 16S rDNA sequences associated with PCB ortho dechlorination had high sequence similarities to the delta, low-G+C gram-positive, and Thermotogales subgroups, which all include sulfur-, sulfate-, and/or iron(III)-respiring bacterial species.
TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies indicate the existence of a cell shape preserving cytoskeleton in prokaryotes.
AB  - Immunoelectron microscopic studies of prokaryotes were performed with anti-actin  antibodies directed against the C terminus of actin. Studies on ultrathin sections revealed high proportions of the overall label close to the cell periphery in Escherichia coli, Ralstonia eutropha, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes, T. thermosaccharolyticum, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Substantial label also in the cytoplasm was observed in Bacillus sp., Methanococcus voltae, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. Only very minor amounts of label were found in the nucleoid region of the cells. Whole-mount immunogold studies, combined with negative staining, revealed the existence of an intracellular network of fibrils which could be labeled by anti-actin antibodies. This network is assumed to be located below the cytoplasmic membrane all around the cytoplasm. It appears to have properties that would allow its function as a cytoskeleton-like structure preserving cell shape.
TI  - Substance P receptor expression in intestinal epithelium in clostridium difficile toxin A enteritis in rats.
AB  - We previously reported that the inflammatory effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A on rat intestine can be significantly inhibited with a specific neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. In this study we investigated the localization and expression of NK-1R mRNA and protein in rat intestine by in situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, respectively, after exposure to toxin A. Northern blot analysis showed increased mucosal levels of NK-1R mRNA starting 30 min after toxin A administration. In situ hybridization showed that toxin A increased NK-1R mRNA expression in intestinal epithelial cells after 30, 120, and 180 min. In rats pretreated with the NK-1R antagonist CP-96345 the increase in NK-1R mRNA levels after exposure to toxin A was inhibited, indicating that NK-1R upregulation is substance P (SP) dependent. One hour after exposure to toxin A many of the intestinal epithelial cells showed staining for NK-1R compared with controls. Specific 125I-SP binding to purified epithelial cell membranes obtained from ileum exposed to toxin A for 15 min was increased twofold over control and persisted for 4 h. This report provides evidence that NK-1R expression is increased in the intestinal epithelium shortly after exposure to toxin A and may be important in toxin A-induced inflammation.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Cloning of an EF-P homologue from Bacteroides fragilis that increases B. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Investigations of possible regulators of Bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were done in Escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. The B. fragilis glnA gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pACYC184 and expressed in the E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion strain, YMC11. GS activity was monitored following co-transformation with a B. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pEcoR251. A gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in B. fragilis GS activity but did not affect the activity of the E. coli GS enzyme or the B. fragilis sucrase (ScrL). Deletion of the B. fragilis glnA downstream region decreased basal levels of GS activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the B. fragilis GS activity. Reporter gene analysis, using the B. fragilis glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. This demonstrated that the increase in GS activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. Sequence data indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor P (EF-P) proteins, the highest being to that of a Synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to Mycobacterium genitalium (27%). Amino acid identity to the E. coli EF-P was intermediate (37%). A possible role for EF-P in enhancing translation of the B. fragilis glnA mRNA is proposed.
TI  - Isolation of a beta-galactosidase-encoding gene from Bacillus licheniformis: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Bacillus licheniformis beta-galactosidase gene, lacBl, was cloned on a 5.8-kb HindIII fragment into pBR322 and expressed by its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Deletion and complementation analysis showed that the enzyme-encoding region was located on a 4. 1-kb HindIII-ClaI fragment. The transcription region for the lacBl was identified on this fragment with promoter- and terminator-probe plasmids. The deduced sequence of 149 aa of the N-terminal part of lacBl showed aa sequence homology with beta-Gal from B. stearothermophilus, B. circulans, Haloferax alicantei, Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter sp.. No significant homology was shared with those found in the lacZ and lacS families. The recombinant beta-galactosidase (LacB1) was purified by FPLC. The molecular mass of the enzyme (80 kDa) and its optimal pH (5.7) and temperature (45 degrees C) were determined.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Isolation of nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants of nitroreductase-producing Clostridium sp. strains from the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of Clostridium leptum, Clostridium paraputrificum, two other Clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. All of the Clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. The nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. At least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible Bacillus sp. strain. Nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. This study indicates that Clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.
TI  - Hydrogen evolution by direct electron transfer from photosystem I to hydrogenases.
AB  - H2 evolution by direct electron transfer from the dithionite-reduced photosystem  I (PSI) complex to both hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II from Clostridium pasteurianum was observed. Evidence indicates that the electron carriers on PSI that transfer electrons to hydrogenase in this system are the FA/FB iron-sulfur clusters on the PsaC polypeptide, the terminal bound electron acceptors in PSI. Light-dependent H2 evolution was also observed, using high potential electron donors to PSI, from a combination of hydrogenase I and either solubilized purified PSI or thylakoids. Mediators capable of transferring electrons from the PSI complex to hydrogenase were not necessary for H2 evolution, indicating again that the mechanism of H2 evolution is direct electron transfer from PSI to hydrogenase, and that this can occur with light-reduced as well as chemically reduced PSI, and with PSI in thylakoids as well as the solubilized complex. Light-dependent H2 evolution was also observed from a mixture of thylakoids and the oxygen-resistant hydrogenase of Rhodococcus sp. MR11. These results suggest that direct electron transfer from PSI to hydrogenase could be engineered to occur in vivo in a photosynthetic organism to create an organism that would efficiently produce H2 from H2O.
TI  - Role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in reductive activation of the cobalt center of the  corrinoid iron-sulfur protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum during acetate biosynthesis.
AB  - The corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum functions as a methyl carrier in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis. The small subunit (33 kDa) contains cobalt in a corrinoid cofactor, and the large subunit (55 kDa) contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The cobalt center is methylated by methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to form a methylcobalt intermediate and, subsequently, is demethylated by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS). The work described here demonstrates that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is required to facilitate the reactivation of oxidatively inactivated Cob(II)amide to the active Co(I) state. Site-directed mutagenesis of the large subunit gene was used to change residue 20 from cysteine to alanine, which resulted in formation of a cluster with EPR and redox properties consistent with those of [3Fe-4S] clusters. The midpoint potential of the cluster in the C20A variant was approximately 500 mV more positive than that of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the native enzyme. Accordingly, it was found that the Co center in the C20A mutant protein could be reduced artificially but was severely crippled in its ability to be reduced by physiological electron donors. This is probably because the reduced cluster of the C20A protein cannot provide the driving force needed to reduce Co(II) to Co(I), since the Co(II/I) midpoint potential is -504 mV. The C20A variant also was unable to catalyze the steady-state synthesis of acetyl-CoA when CH3-H4folate or methyl iodide were provided as methyl donors and CO and CODH/ACS as reductants. Addition of chemical reductants rescued the catalytically crippled variant form in both of these reactions. On the other hand, in single-turnover reactions, the methyl-Co state of the altered protein was fully active in methylating H4folate and in synthesizing acetyl-CoA in the presence of CO and CoA. The combined results strongly indicate that the FeS cluster of the CFeSP is necessary for reductive activation of Co(II) to Co(I) by physiological reductants but is not required for catalysis, e.g., demethylation of CH3-H4folate or methylation of CODH/ACS. We propose that, during reductive activation, electrons flow from the reduced electron-transfer protein (e.g., CODH/ACS or reduced ferredoxin (Fd)) to the FeS cluster which then directs electrons to the cobalt center for catalysis. These results also support earlier hypotheses that the methylation and demethylation reactions involving the CFeSP are SN2-type nucleophilic displacement reactions and do not involve radical chemistry.
TI  - New aerobic ammonium-dependent obligately oxalotrophic bacteria: description of Ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - The genus Ammoniphilus is proposed for aerobic endospore-forming Gram-variable rod-shaped bacteria, which are ammonium-dependent, obligately oxalotrophic and haloalkalitolerant, oxidase- and catalase-positive, mesophilic and motile by peritrichous flagella. Cell wall contained two electron-dense layers. The external layer consists of a chain of electron-dense granules morphologically resembling the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. Two species are described, Ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and Ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strains of these species are strains RAOx-1 (= DSM 11538) and RAOx-FS (= DSM 11537), respectively. Ammoniphilus strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of sorrel (Rumex acetosa) and from decaying wood. The strains require a high concentration of ammonium ions and use oxalate as the sole organic source of carbon and energy for growth; no growth factors were required. Growth occurred at pH 6.8-9.5. The optimum temperature and pH for growth were 28-30 degrees C and 8.0-8.5. All strains grew in a saturated solution of ammonium oxalate, and tolerated 3% NaCl. Whole-cell hydrolysates contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and glucose. The menaquinone of the strains was MK 7, and the major cellular fatty acids were 12-methyl tetradecanoic, cis-hexadec-9-enoic and hexadecanoic acids. The G + C content of the DNA was 45-46 mol% for A. oxalaticus and 42 mol% for A. oxalivorans. The almost complete 16S rDNA sequence of three strains of the two species of Ammoniphilus shows that the genus falls into the radiation of the Clostridium-Bacillus subphylum of Gram-positive bacteria. The closest phylogenetic neighbour of Ammoniphilus is Oxalophagus oxalicus. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains RAOx-1 and RAOx-FS was 39.7%.
TI  - Purification and properties of an amylopullulanase, a glucoamylase, and an alpha-glucosidase in the amylolytic enzyme system of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum.
AB  - Thermoanaerobic bacteria are of considerable interest as producers of thermostable amylolytic enzymes. The soluble amylolytic enzyme system of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum DSM 571 was fractionated into a pullulanase, a glucoamylase, and an alpha-glucosidase. The enzymes were purified to homogeneity and their physical and catalytic properties were studied. The pullulanase, which cleaved both alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds, was an amylopullulanase closely related to similar enzymes from other thermoanaerobic bacteria. Partial amino acid sequences of the glucoamylase were identical with the corresponding sequences deduced from the cga gene encoding the glucoamylase from Clostridium sp. strain G0005. The alpha-glucosidase was identified as an isomaltase belonging to a group of structurally related exo-alpha-1,4-glucosidases and oligo-1,6-glucosidases from bacilli. Comparison of enzyme activities indicated that the glucoamylase had the major amylolytic activity of T. thermosaccharolyticum, with amylopullulanase and alpha-glucosidase assisting in the cleavage of alpha-1,6-glucosidic bonds.
TI  - Amino acid sequence and stereoselective hydrolytic reaction of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from a Bacillus strain.
AB  - Bacillus sp. KSM-522 produces three different extracellular endo-1,4-beta-glucanases [EGs; Okoshi et al., Agric. Biol. Chem., 54, 83-89 (1990)]. Here, we report the molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene for the fourth EG (EG-IV) of the organism and the mechanism of its hydrolytic reaction. The structural gene contained an open reading frame of 1911 bp, corresponding to 636 amino acids, the amino acid sequence of which was very close to that of an EG of Clostridium cellulovorans, belonging to the cellulase family E2. The molecular mass of the extracellular mature enzyme (Ser26 through Lys636) was calculated to be 69,076 Da, a value close to the 69.2 kDa measured for the recombinant EG-IV expressed in Bacillus subtilis. The optimum pH and temperature for activity of the recombinant enzyme were pH 8.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. By 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellotrioside by EG-IV proceeded with inversion of the anomeric configuration.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Mutagenicity of azo dyes used in foods, drugs and cosmetics before and after reduction by Clostridium species from the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Various azo dyes currently approved by the US FDA for use in foods, drugs and cosmetics are reduced by anaerobic bacteria from the human intestinal tract. These bacteria with azoreductase activities include several Clostridium species. Seven of these azo dyes and their reduction products following incubation with a Clostridium sp. were evaluated for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. No mutagenicity was induced in either TA98 or TA100 by any of the seven azo dyes or the reduced metabolites when tested at concentrations as high as 200 microg/plate, with or without exogenous metabolic activation by rat liver fraction S-9.
TI  - Acute intravascular haemolysis with massive microspherocytosis in a 75-year-old woman.
AB  - Acute intravascular haemolysis (AIH) sometimes occurs in patients with sepsis or  bacteraemia, mainly due to clostridia or Salmonella sp., and may be a life-threatening condition. We describe a case of AIH in a 75-yr-old woman with chronic cholelithiasis. Blood and stool cultures were repeatedly negative, but the massive microspherocytosis, typically observed in clostridia infections, oriented our diagnosis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and for a rapid worsening of her conditions, which could have led to the onset of a multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), with plasma exchange and, subsequently, haemodialysis, with satisfactory results.
TI  - In-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - One hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. All isolates, except Rothia spp. (one), Enterococcus avium (three), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. All the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. A potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the MICs of spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of Eubacterium, two of lactobacilli, one strain of Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.
TI  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of some Eubacterium-like isolates containing a novel type B wall murein from human feces: description of Holdemania filiformis gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  - A group of Eubacterium-like strains (designated group S14), isolated from the feces of healthy people, was characterized by biochemical tests, fatty acid analysis, cell wall murein analysis, and 16S rDNA analysis. Our results indicate that group S14 is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria. Despite a phenotypic resemblance to the genus Eubacterium, group S14 was shown to be phylogenetically distantly related to the type species of the genus, Eubacterium limosum. Group S14 showed a specific phylogenetic association with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Group S14 resembled Erysipelothrix in possessing the uncommon type B cell wall murein. Structural analyses, however, revealed the presence of a previously unknown B1 delta (L-Ala)-D-Glu-Gly-L-Lys murein type. Based on a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of greater than 10% with E. rhusiopathiae and the presence of a unique murein type, a new genus, Holdemania, is proposed for group S14, with one species, Holdemania filiformis. Type strain of H. filiformis is ATCC 51649.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the homoacetogenic thermophilic bacterium Moorella glycerini sp. nov.
AB  - A thermophilic, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium (strain JW/AS-Y6T) was isolated from a mixed sediment-water sample from a hot spring (Calcite Spring area) at Yellowstone National Park. The vegetative cells of this organism were straight rods, 0.4 to 0.6 by 3.0 to 6.5 microns. Cells occurred singly and exhibited a slight tumbling motility. They formed round refractile endospores in terminal swollen sporangia. Cells stained gram positive. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.8 was 43 to 65 degrees C, with optimum growth at 58 degrees C. The range for growth at 60 degrees C (pH60C; with the pH meter calibrated at 60 degrees C) was 5.9 to 7.8, with an optimum pH60C of 6.3 to 6.5. The substrates utilized included glycerol, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, xylose, lactate, glycerate, pyruvate, and yeast extract. In the presence of CO2, acetate was the only organic product from glycerol and carbohydrate fermentation. No H2 was produced during growth. The strain was not able to grow chemolithotrophically at the expense of H2-CO2; however, suspensions of cells in the exponential growth phase consumed H2. The bacterium reduced fumarate to succinate and thiosulfate to elemental sulfur. Growth was inhibited by ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, rifampin, and tetracycline, but not by streptomycin. The G+C content of the DNA was 54.5 mol% (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography). The 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis placed the isolate in the Gram type-positive Bacillus-Clostridium subphylum. On the basis of physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis we propose that the isolated strain constitutes a new species, Moorella glycerini; the type strain is JW/AS-Y6 (= DSM 11254 = ATCC 700316).
TI  - Three Neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  - Acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum. A cDNA expression library from N. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cDNA clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaA-D) were isolated. None of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (BnaA and BnaC) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaA, bnaB and bnaC encode proteins with several distinct domains. Carboxy-terminal repeats in BnaA and BnaC are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from Neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a Piromyces sp. The catalytic domains of BnaB and BnaC are members of a recently described family of Ser/His active site hydrolases [Upton, C. & Buckley, J.T. (1995). Trends Biochem Sci 20, 178-179]. BnaB exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the CelE cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum and BnaC exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the XynB xylanase from Ruminococcus flavefaciens. BnaA, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to BnaB or BnaC, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. Several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from Aspergillus aculeatus. However, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.
TI  - The kdp system of Clostridium acetobutylicum: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional regulation in response to potassium concentration.
AB  - The complete sequence of the kdp gene region of Clostridium acetobutylicum has been determined. This part of the chromosome comprises two small open reading frames (orfZ and orfY), putatively encoding hydrophobic peptides, and the genes kdpA, kdpB, kdpC, and kdpX, followed by an operon encoding a pair of sensor-effector regulatory proteins (KdpD and KdpE). Except for orfZ, orfY, and kdpX, all genes showed significant homology to the kdp genes of Escherichia coli, encoding a high-affinity potassium transport ATPase and its regulators. The complete genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 and a recently published part of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate the existence of a kdp system in these organisms as well, but all three systems comprise neither a second orf upstream of kdpA nor an additional kdpX gene. Expression of the clostridial kdp genes, including the unique kdpX gene, was found to be inducible by low potassium concentrations. A transcription start point could be mapped upstream of orfZ. A promoter upstream of kdpD was active only under noninducing conditions. Lowering the potassium content of the medium led to formation of a common transcript (orfZYkdpABCXDE), with a putative internal RNase E recognition site, which could be responsible for the instability of the common transcript. Except for the two small peptides, all gene products could be detected in in vitro transcription-translation experiments.
TI  - Liver torsion and associated bacterial peritonitis in a dog.
AB  - A Malamute was examined for acute abdominal pain and collapse. Radiographs of the abdomen showed a pneumoabdomen, and a lucent mass in the region of the liver. Abdominocentesis yielded an inflammatory exudate with bacteria compatible with a Bacillus or a Clostridium sp. A quadrate lobe torsion was found at postmortem.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - The Helicobacter pylori ureC gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  - The function of UreC, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureAB) of Helicobacter pylori, was investigated. We present data showing that the ureC gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. D. Mengin-Lecreulx and J. van Heijenoort (J. Biol. Chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that UreC is similar (43% identity) to the GlmM protein of Escherichia coli. Those authors showed that GlmM is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. The present paper reports that, like its E. coli homolog glmM, the H. pylori ureC gene is essential for cell growth. It was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmM mutant of E. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the ureC gene. We showed that complete complementation of the glmM mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing UreC. The peptidoglycan content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the ureC gene product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. Homologs of the UreC and GlmM proteins were identified in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium leprae, Clostridium perfringens, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. We propose renaming the H. pylori ureC gene the glmM gene.
TI  - Increased substance P responses in dorsal root ganglia and intestinal macrophages during Clostridium difficile toxin A enteritis in rats.
AB  - Previously we reported that pretreatment of rats with the substance P (SP) antagonist CP-96,345 inhibits the enterotoxic responses following administration of toxin A from Clostridium difficile into ileal loops, indicating that SP participates in the intestinal responses to this toxin. We now report that injection of toxin A into rat ileum causes a rapid increase in SP content in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and mucosal scrapings 30-60 min after toxin A administration. Toxin A-mediated fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, and ileal histologic damage is significantly increased only after 2 hr. Toxin A also causes an increase in the abundance of SP mRNA in lumbar DRG and ileal mucosa as measured by reverse transcription-PCR. Lamina propria macrophages (LPMs) obtained from toxin A-injected loops release greater amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and SP as compared with LPMs isolated from buffer-injected loops (P < 0.01). Pretreatment of rats with the SP antagonist CP-96,345 inhibits toxin A-mediated TNFalpha release from isolated LPMs, whereas an inactive enantiomer (CP-96,344) of the SP antagonist has no effect. LPMs obtained from toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with SP (10(-8) to 10(-9) M) show enhanced TNFalpha secretion, whereas LPMs isolated from buffer-injected loops do not respond to SP. In addition, LPMs obtained from toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with CP-96,345 showed a diminished TNFalpha release. Our results indicate that activated LPMs secrete SP during toxin A enteritis that can lead to secretion of cytokines, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine regulation of cytokine secretion by SP from LPMs during intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Dockerin-like sequences in cellulases and xylanases from the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  - Recent analysis of the endA cellulase gene from Ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 has  revealed that it encodes a product of 759 amino acids that provides the first example of a multidomain cellulase from a Ruminococcus sp. Following the family 5 catalytic domain in the predicted EndA enzyme is a 282 amino acid domain of unknown function for which no close relationship was found to other protein sequences. However, the C-terminal sequences of EndA contain a 34 amino acid threonine-rich linker connected to an 81 amino acid region, both of which show strong similarities to sequences present in two xylanases from R. flavefaciens 17. A distant relationship is evident between regions of the 80 amino acid sequences of EndA, XynD and XynB and the duplicated 23 amino acid dockerin sequences found in cellulolytic Clostridium sp., suggesting that as in Clostridium sp. these sequences could mediate the binding of enzymatic polypeptides to another component in the cell surface enzyme complex of R. flavefaciens.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - Thermoterrabacterium ferrireducens gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic anaerobic  dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacterium from a continental hot spring.
AB  - A strain of a thermophilic, anaerobic, dissimilatory, Fe(III)-reducing bacterium, Thermoterrabacterium ferrireducens gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain JW/AS-Y7T; DSM 11255), was isolated from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park and New Zealand. The gram-positive-staining cells occurred singly or in pairs as straight to slightly curved rods, 0.3 to 0.4 by 1.6 to 2.7 microns, with rounded ends and exhibited a tumbling motility. Spores were not observed. The temperature range for growth was 50 to 74 degrees C with an optimum at 65 degrees C. The pH range for growth at 65 degrees C was from 5.5 to 7.6, with an optimum at 6.0 to 6.2. The organism coupled the oxidation of glycerol to reduction of amorphous Fe(III) oxide or Fe(III) citrate as an electron acceptor. In the presence as well as in the absence of Fe(III) and in the presence of CO2, glycerol was metabolized by incomplete oxidation to acetate as the only organic metabolic product; no H2 was produced during growth. The organism utilized glycerol, lactate, 1,2-propanediol, glycerate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose, mannose, and yeast extract as substrates. In the presence of Fe(III) the bacterium utilized molecular hydrogen. The organism reduced 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid, fumarate (to succinate), and thiosulfate (to elemental sulfur) but did not reduce MnO2, nitrate, sulfate, sulfite, or elemental sulfur. The G + C content of the DNA was 41 mol% (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography). The 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis placed the isolated strain as a member of a new genus within the gram-type-positive Bacillus-Clostridium subphylum.
TI  - Cultures of "Clostridium acetobutylicum" from various collections comprise Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinckii, and two other distinct types based on DNA-DNA reassociation.
AB  - The best-known acetone-butanol (solvent)-producing bacterium is the Weizmann organism, Clostridium acetobutylicum, which was used for starch-based industrial fermentation. In the past two decades, cultures of "C. acetobutylicum" from various culture collections have included organisms that were isolated for sugar (molasses)-based industrial solvent production. Recent biochemical and genetic studies have revealed significant differences among some of these "C. acetobutylicum" strains. We used DNA-DNA reassociation to analyze 39 cultures of "C. acetobutylicum" and phenotypically similar organisms from major collections. The results of this study clearly identified four groups intergroup reassociation values of less than 30%. All of the intragroup values except the value for one strain were 68% or more, which supported species status for each group. The C. acetobutylicum group (with ATCC 824 as the type strain) consisted of 17 cultures and had average reassociation values of 10% with the other three groups. All strains of C. acetobutylicum produced riboflavin in milk, and the cultures were bright yellow, which is useful for differentiating this species from the other three groups. The Clostridium beijerinckii group (with VPI 5481 [= ATCC 25752] as the type strain) consisted of 16 cultures and included strains NCIMB 8052 and NCP 270. Strains NCP 262 and NRRL B643 constituted the third group, whereas strain N1-4 ("Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum") and its derivative, strain N1-4081, formed the fourth group. At present, the last two groups are each represented by only one independent strain; definitive descriptions of these two groups as two new or revived species will require further phenotypic characterization, as well as identification of additional strains. C. beijerinckii NCP 270, Clostridium sp. strain NRRL B643, and "C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum" were used in industrial solvent production from molasses, which confirms that the new organisms used for the sugar-based processes are distinct from C. acetobutylicum.
TI  - Sporomusa silvacetica sp, nov., an acetogenic bacterium isolated from aggregated  forest soil.
AB  - Sporomusa silvacetica sp. nov. DG-1T (= DSMZ 10669T) (T = type strain) was isolated from well-drained, aggregated forest soil (pH 6.0) in east-central Germany. The cells were obligately anaerobic, slightly curved rods and were motile by means of laterally inserted flagella on the concave side of each cell. Typical cells were approximately 3.5 by 0.7 micron. Cells stained weakly gram positive, but thin sections revealed a complex multilayer cell wall. Spores were spherical and distended the sporangia. Growth and substrate utilization occurred with ferulate, vanillate, fructose, betaine, fumarate, 2,3-butanediol, pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, ethanol, methanol, formate, and H2-CO2. With most substrates, acetate was the primary reduced end product and was produced in stoichiometries indicative of an acetyl-coenzyme A pathway-dependent metabolism. Fumarate was dismutated to succinate and acetate. Methoxyl and acrylate groups of various aromatic compounds were O-demethylated and reduced, respectively. Yeast extract was not required for growth. Cells grew optimally at approximately 30 degrees C and pH 6.8; under these conditions and with fructose as the substrate, the doubling time was approximately 14 h. The lowest temperature that supported growth was between 5 and 10 degrees C. The carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and hydrogenase activities were approximately 9 and 102 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1, respectively. A type b cytochrome was detected in the membrane. The G + C content was approximately 43 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA indicated that DG-1T was most closely related to members of the genus Sporomusa in the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Assimilation of sulfur from alkyl- and arylsulfonates by Clostridium spp.
AB  - Organisms able to utilize one of several alkyl- and arylsulfonates as sole source of sulfur under anoxic conditions were enriched. Three fermenting bacteria, all putative Clostridium spp., were isolated in pure culture. All three organisms had wide substrate ranges for alkylsulfonates, taurine and arylsulfonates, presumably due to three different enzyme systems. One organism, strain KNNDS (DSM 10612) was selected for further characterization. The organism was possibly a new Clostridium sp., with Clostidium intestinalis as its nearest neighbor (97.6% similarity of rDNA). Strain KNNDS catalyzed complete sulfonate utilization concomitant with growth. Growth yields of approximtely 3 kg protein/mol sulfur were observed, independent of the sulfur source [e.g. sulfate, sulfide, 4-(phenyl)butyl-1-sulfonate, 2,6-naphthyldisulfonate or 4-nitrocatechol sulfate]. We failed to detect significant amounts of either an arylsulfonatase or an arylsulfatase, and we hypothesize different arylsulfatases [EC 3.1.6.1] in aerobes and in Clostridium spp.
TI  - Assessment of fecal bacteria with bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylating activity for  the presence of bai-like genes.
AB  - Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 has several bile acid-inducible (bai) genes which encode enzymes in the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation (7 alpha DeOH) pathway. Twelve 7 alpha DeOH-positive intestinal bacterial strains were assayed for 7 alpha DeOH activity, and 13 strains were tested for hybridization with bai genes. Cholic acid 7 alpha DeOH activity varied greatly (> 100-fold) among these strains. Southern blot experiments showed that DNA prepared from 7 of 13 strains hybridized with at least one of the bai genes from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708.
TI  - Quantitative flow cytometric detection of specific microorganisms in soil samples using rRNA targeted fluorescent probes and ethidium bromide.
AB  - Specific detection and accurate enumeration of microorganisms in the environment  have been hampered by the lack of suitable techniques. A three-parameter flow cytometric method (FCM) was developed to detect quantitatively Sphingomonas sp. strain 107 inoculated into soil samples. By combining light scattering profiles (i.e., morphological properties), ethidium bromide (EtBr) influx (i.e., wall permeability), and fluorescence in situ hybridization against the 16S rRNA (i.e., detection specificity), we could accurately discriminate the bacterium of interest from the indigenous microflora and soil debris. EtBr was used, first, to determine the optimal cell wall permeabilization treatment to allow oligonucleotide probes to enter the bacterial cells and, second, to achieve clear discrimination of fixed cells from debris in soil samples. This method allowed effective qualitative and quantitative analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results showed that the detection threshold by FCM was 3 x 10(4) cells/g of dry soil. Cell counts deduced from FCM analysis were similar to those obtained by the colony forming unit assay when soils contained fewer than 3 x 106 cells/g dry soil. This method should be useful for either quantitative monitoring of microorganisms inoculated in contaminated soil samples during bioremediation or detecting known bacterial strains in environmental samples.
TI  - The heterocyst-specific fdxH gene product of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC  7120 is important but not essential for nitrogen fixation.
AB  - To clarify the role of the heterocyst-specific [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin in cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation, mutational analysis of the Anabaena 7120 fdxH gene region was carried out. First, the DNA sequence of the wild-type 3509-bp EcoRI fragment downstream of the fdxH gene was determined. Genes homologous to ORF3 from the fdxH gene regions of A. variabilis and Plectonema boryanum, the mop genes of Clostridium pasteurianum encoding molybdo-pterin binding proteins, and ORF3 from the A. variabilis hydrogenase gene cluster were identified within the sequenced region. For mutational analysis the Anabaena 7120 mutant strains LAK4, BMB92, and KSH10 were constructed. In LAK4 the fdxH coding region is disrupted by an interposon, whereas BMB92 is deleted for a 2799-bp NheI fragment encompassing fdxH, ORF3, mop, ORF4, and ORF5. Mutant strain KSH10 is a derivative of BMB92, complemented for fdxH but not for the other genes located further downstream. Analysis of the Nif phenotype of these mutant strains showed that FdxH is necessary for maximum nitrogenase activity and optimal growth under nitrogen-fixing conditions, but not absolutely essential for diazotrophic growth. The role of alternative electron donors for nitrogenase, which might substitute for FdxH, is discussed. Iron concentrations (1 microM Fe) sufficient to induce synthesis of the vegetative cell flavodoxin did not stimulate diazotrophic growth of the fdxH mutant strains, suggesting that FdxH was not replaced by a NifJ-flavodoxin system. Comparison of LAK4 and BMB92 indicated that one of the genes located downstream of fdxH might also play a (minor) role in nitrogen fixation.
TI  - Assimilation of sulfur from alkyl- and arylsulfonates by Clostridium spp.
AB  - Organisms able to utilize one of several alkyl- and arylsulfonates as sole source of sulfur under anoxic conditions were enriched. Three fermenting bacteria, all putative Clostridium spp., were isolated in pure culture. All three organisms had wide substrate ranges for alkylsulfonates, taurine and arylsulfonates, presumably due to three different enzyme systems. One organism, strain KNNDS (DSM 10612) was selected for further characterization. The organism was possibly a new Clostridium sp., with Clostidium intestinalis as its nearest neighbor (97.6% similarity of rDNA). Strain KNNDS catalyzed complete sulfonate utilization concomitant with growth. Growth yields of approximtely 3 kg protein/mol sulfur were observed, independent of the sulfur source [e.g. sulfate, sulfide, 4-(phenyl)butyl-1-sulfonate, 2,6-naphthyldisulfonate or 4-nitrocatechol sulfate]. We failed to detect significant amounts of either an arylsulfonatase or an arylsulfatase, and we hypothesize different arylsulfatases [EC 3.1.6.1] in aerobes and in Clostridium spp.
TI  - Clostridium vincentii sp. nov., a new obligately anaerobic, saccharolytic, psychrophilic bacterium isolated from low-salinity pond sediment of the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica.
AB  - A gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped, strictly anaerobic bacterium was isolated from an enrichment initiated with sediment taken from below the cyanobacterial mat of a low-salinity pond on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The organism grew optimally at 12 degrees C, at pH 6.5, and at an NaCl concentration of< 0.5% (w/v). It survived freeze-thawing at low salt concentrations,but not exposure to temperatures over 25 degrees C for more than 20 h or short-term exposure to temperatures> 50 degrees C. Out of a variety of polysaccharides tested as growth substrates, only xylan supported growth. The organism also grew on a variety of mono- and disaccharides including the cyanobacterial cell wall constituent, N-acetyl glucosamine. Fermentation products on a mol product per 100 mol of hexose monomer fermented basis were: acetate, 72; formate, 72; butyrate, 55; hydrogen, 114; and CO2, 100. Not detectable in the culture medium(< 2 mol per 100 mol of monomer) were lactate, propionate, ethanol,n-propanol, n-butanol, and succinate. The G+C content of the DNA from the bacterium was 33 mol%, and a phylogenetic analysis indicated that it grouped closely with members of the RNA-DNA homology group 1 of the genus Clostridium. It differed from other species of this genus with regard to growth temperature optimum, substrate range, and fermentation pattern, and is therefore designated as a new species of Clostridium for which the name Clostridium vincentii is proposed. The type strain is lac-1 (DSM 10228).
TI  - Clostridium pascui sp. nov., a new glutamate-fermenting sporeformer from a pasture in Pakistan.
AB  - Four strains of an obligately anaerobic spore-forming bacterium were isolated from soil samples from a donkey pasture in Pakistan. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the strains are members of phylogenetic cluster I of the genus Clostridium (Collins et al. 1994). The strains are mesophilic, nonsaccharolytic, and nonproteolytic, utilize glutamate and histidine, and produce indole. Acetate, butyrate, ethanol, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide are the products of fermentation. Although the strains phenotypically resemble the classical glutamate-fermenting clostridia, such as Clostridium cochlearium, Clostridium tetanomorphum, Clostridium tetani, and especially Clostridium malenominatum, they differ from these organisms in sugar utilization, cellular fatty acid composition, and cellular protein pattern and by a 16S rRNA sequence divergence value of approximately 4 to 8%. Phylogenetically, the strains are more closely related to Clostridium estertheticum (sequence divergence, approximately 5%) and Clostridium subterminale (sequence divergence, approximately 5%) but are phenotypically readily distinguished from these species. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic criteria, we conclude that the four strains are members of a new species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium pascui is proposed. The type strain is strain Cm19 (= DSM 10365).
TI  - Risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  - The epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994, the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in England and Wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). Salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and S. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. Small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, Clostridium perfringens in four, Bacillus cereus in two, and Campylobacter sp and Escherichia coli in one each. No pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. Outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. The commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. Salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight outbreaks. Raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. Inappropriate storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. Outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. Public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
TI  - [Perioperative managements for postoperative severe infections in compromised host].
AB  - The incidence of postoperative infections, especially due to multi-drug resistant strains such as Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp., and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is high in compromised hosts. Among them, respiratory infection, catheter sepsis, and drug-associated enteritis are frequently observed and respiratory infection is liable to fall into serious illness. These infections have characteristics in causative organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MRSA are frequently isolated in respiratory infections and Candida or coagulase-negative staphylococcus are frequently isolated in catheter sepsis. G-test in addition to blood culture is necessary for early diagnosis of Candida sepsis, vancomycin should be administered in early phase of antibiotic-associated enteritis, since this infection is usually caused by MRSA or Clostridium difficile and frequently falls into serious illness. The patients with protein-calorie malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, diabetes melitis, administration of anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy, serious injury, or severe operative stress are considered to be compromised hosts in surgical field, and the adequate perioperative managements according to these disorders should be carried out against postoperative infections.
TI  - Sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a bile acid transporter from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708.
AB  - Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 expresses inducible bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity via a multistep pathway. The genes encoding several of the inducible proteins involved in the pathway have been previously mapped to a bile acid-inducible (bai) operon in Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. We now report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the baiG gene, which is part of the bai operon. The predicted amino acid sequence of the BaiG polypeptide shows significant homology to several membrane transport proteins, including sugar and antibiotic resistance transporters, which are members of the major facilitator superfamily. Hydrophilicity plots of BaiG show a high degree of similarity to class K and L TetA proteins from gram-positive bacteria, and, like these classes of TetA proteins, BaiG has 14 proposed transmembrane domains. The baiG gene was cloned into Escherichia coli and shown to confer an energy-dependent bile acid uptake activity. Primary bile acids were preferentially transported into E. coli cells expressing this gene, with at least sevenfold and fourfold increases in the uptake of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively, over control reactions. Less transport activity was observed with cholylglycine, 7-oxocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid. The transport activity was inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and nigericin but not by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that the transport is driven by the proton motive force across the cell membrane. In summary, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a bile acid-inducible bile acid transporter from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a gene encoding a procaryotic bile acid transporter.
TI  - Substance P activation of enteric neurons in response to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nerves have been suggested to mediate the effects of bacterial toxins in intestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. This study examined endogenous substance P (SP) activation of the substance P receptor (SPR) on enteric neurons in the rat ileum after exposure to intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A. METHODS: After intraluminal injection of toxin A in ileal loops, tissue was examined for pathological changes by histology and for SPR activation by immunocytochemical analysis of SP-induced SPR endocytosis. RESULTS: After toxin A administration, > 70% of enteric neurons showed SPR endocytosis and became swollen with thickened dendrites. In contrast, SPRs in control rats were largely confined to the plasma membrane. Rats denervated of primary afferent fibers with neonatal capsaicin injection and animals pretreated with a nonpeptide SPR antagonist showed few endosomal SPRs, and the pathological inflammatory effects of toxin A were ablated. CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal toxin A causes the release of SP from primary afferent neurons: this endogenous SP then acts on enteric neurons in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. SP is the primary mediator of an axon reflex mediating neurogenic inflammation in the intestine. SPR blockade may prove to be a novel therapy used to prevent intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Clostridium ultunense sp. nov., a mesophilic bacterium oxidizing acetate in syntrophic association with a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacterium.
AB  - A syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium, strain BST (T = type strain), was isolated from a previously described mesophilic triculture that was able to syntrophically oxidize acetate and form methane in stoichiometric amounts. Strain BST was isolated with substrates typically utilized by homoacetogenic bacteria. Strain BST was a spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped organism which utilized formate, glucose, ethylene glycol, cysteine, betaine, and pyruvate. Acetate and sometimes formate were the main fermentation products. Small amounts of alanine were also produced from glucose, betaine, and cysteine. Strain BST grew optimally at 37 degrees C and pH 7. The G+C content of the DNA of strain BST was 32 mol%. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that strain BST was a member of a new species of the genus Clostridium. We propose the name Clostridium ultunense for this organism; strain BS is the type strain of C. ultunense.
TI  - Anaerofilum pentosovorans gen. nov., sp. nov., and Anaerofilum agile sp. nov., two new, strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, acidogenic bacteria from anaerobic bioreactors.
AB  - Strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, nonsporing, thin rod-shaped organisms whose cells were 0.2 to 0.6 by 3 to 6 microns were isolated from a Hoechst Biohochreaktor (strain FaeT [T = type strain]) and from the biofilm population of a fixed-film reactor treating sour whey (strain FT). Strain FT was vigorously motile during early logarithmic growth by means of peritrichously inserted flagella, while strain FaeT was seldom motile and usually possessed no flagella. During the stationary growth phase both strains formed spheroplasts. The temperature optimum was close to 37 degrees C (temperature range for growth, > or = 17 to < 45 degrees C) and the pH optimum was 7.0 to 7.4 (pH range, 6.5 to 8.0) for both strains. The two organisms grew chemoorganotrophically on a number of mono- and disaccharides, including glucose and xylose; yeast extract was required for growth. The principal fermentation products from glucose included lactate, acetate, ethanol, formate, and CO2. Hydrogen was not generated. The G + C contents of the DNAs of strains FaeT and FT were 55 and 54.5 mol%, respectively. The cell wall architecture was typical of gram-positive bacteria; the cells had an extraordinarily thin type A3 alpha' peptidoglycan layer containing muramic acid. Analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the two new isolates demonstrated that they represent members of a new genus of bacteria in Clostridium cluster IV of the domain Bacteria and that the misclassified organism Fusobacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum are among their closest relatives. The names Anaerofilum pentosovorans gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, strain Fae [= DSM 7168]) and Anaerofilum agile sp. nov. (type strain, strain F [= DSM 4272]) are proposed.
TI  - The effect of rumen chitinolytic bacteria on cellulolytic anaerobic fungi.
AB  - The polycentric anaerobic fungus Orpinomyces joyonii A4 was cultivated on microcrystalline cellulose alone and in association with the rumen chitinolytic bacterium Clostridium sp. strain ChK5, which shows strong phenotypic similarity to Clostridium tertium. The presence of strain ChK5 significantly depressed the solubilization of microcrystalline cellulose, the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and the release of endoglucanase by the fungus. Co-culture of the monocentric anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix frontalis strain RE1, Neocallimastix sp. strain G-1 and Caecomyces sp. strain SC2 with strain ChK5 also resulted in depressed fungal cellulolysis. Cell-free supernatant fluids from strain ChK5 inhibited the release of reducing sugars from carboxymethylcellulose by cell-free supernatant fluids from O. joyonii strain A4. Strain 007 of the cellulolytic anaerobe Ruminococcus flavefaciens was also shown to produce small amounts of soluble products upon incubation with colloidal chitin. Mixtures of culture supernates from this bacterium and from O. joyonii strain A4 showed cellulase activity that was less than that of the component cultures. It is suggested that the ability of some rumen bacteria to hydrolyse or transform chitin may be an important factor in the interactions between bacteria and fungi in the rumen.
TI  - The isolation and characterization of a rumen chitinolytic bacterium.
AB  - Chitinolytic bacteria were detected in faeces and digesta of wild and domesticated herbivores. The presence of chitinolytic bacteria in two cows was verified following enrichment culture of rumen fluid on colloidal chitin. In three other cows, direct counts on chitin agar showed that the numbers of these bacteria in the rumen fluid ranged from 5 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(8) ml-1. Most of these bacteria were Clostridium-like spore producers. The most typical strain, Clostridium sp. ChK5, was characterized further. This bacterium degraded colloidal chitin and produced mainly acetate, butyrate and lactate. Endochitinase and chitobiase were produced when chitin was the growth substrate. Endochitinase was also detected in cultures grown on N-acetylglucosamine and glucose. Optimal conditions for endochitinase activity were 37 degrees C and pH 4.5-6.1. The Michaelis constant (Km) for this enzyme was 19.3 mg ml-1. Strain ChK5 shows strong phenotypic similarity to Clostridium tertium.
TI  - Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus sp. nov., a new H2/CO2-utilizing acetogenic bacterium isolated from human feces.
AB  - A new H2/CO2-utilizing acetogenic bacterium was isolated from the feces of a non-methane-excreting human subject. The two strains S5a33 and S5a36 were strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, non-sporulating coccobacilli. The isolates grew autotrophically by metabolizing H2/CO2 to form acetate as sole metabolite and were also able to grow heterotrophically on a variety of organic compounds. The major end product of glucose and fructose fermentation was acetate; the strains also formed ethanol, lactate and, to a lesser extent, isobutyrate and isovalerate. The G+C content of DNA of strain S5a33 was 45.2 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the two acetogenic isolates were phylogenetically identical and represent a new subline within Clostridium cluster XIVa. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, a new species, Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus, is proposed. The type strain of R. hydrogenotrophicus is S5a33 (DSM 10507). Furthermore, H2/CO2 acetogenesis appeared to be a common property of most of the species phylogenetically closely related to strain S5a33 (Clostridium coccoides, Ruminococcus hansenii, and Ruminococcus productus).
TI  - Clostridium proteoclasticum sp. nov., a novel proteolytic bacterium from the bovine rumen.
AB  - A novel proteolytic bacterium was isolated from rumen contents of New Zealand cattle grazing fresh forage and was designated strain B316(T) (T = type strain). Strain B316(T) cells were straight to slightly curved rods (width, 0.4 to 0.6 microns; length, 1.3 to 3.0 microns) that were gram-positive and possessed a single subterminal flagellum. This isolate did not produce catalase, indole, ammonia, lipase, or lecithinase, or reduce nitrate, but it did produce a curd reaction with milk. Strain B316(T) was proteolytic, hydrolyzing casein and fraction I leaf protein. The crude proteinase was predominantly the serine type, but some cysteine proteinase and metallo-proteinase activities were also detected. The DNA base composition of strain B316(T) was 28 mol% G+C. A 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis of strain B316(T) indicated that it was most closely related to a member of clostridial cluster XIVa, viz., Clostridium aminophilum, an amino acid-fermenting organism isolated from the rumen; the similarity value was 92.2%. The results of the phenotypic characterization analysis, G+C content analysis, and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence set strain B316(T) apart from all of the members of cluster XIVa. We propose that strain B316(T) should be designated a new species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium proteoclasticum. Strain B316 is the type strain and has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as strain ATCC 51982.
TI  - A new H2/CO2-using acetogenic bacterium from the rumen: description of Ruminococcus schinkii sp. nov.
AB  - Two strains of H2/CO2-using acetogenic bacteria were isolated from the rumen of suckling lambs. Both strains displayed a coccobacillar morphology and possessed a Gram-positive type cell wall. Numerous organic substrates, including some O-methylated aromatic compounds, were used heterotrophically. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the two acetogenic isolates were phylogenetically identical and represent a new subline within Clostridium cluster XIVa. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations a new species, Ruminococcus schinkii sp. nov., is proposed.
TI  - Expression and characterization of a C24 bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The intestinal bacterium Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 has been shown to have  a bile acid 7 alpha/7 beta-dehydroxylation pathway. A large bile acid inducible (bai) operon encoding at least 9 open reading frames has been cloned and sequenced from this bacterium. The baiE gene from this operon has been subcloned and expressed in E. coli and found to encode a bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase (BA7 alpha D). The purified BA7 alpha D was shown to have a calculated subunit mass of 19 kD and a relative native molecular weight of 36,000. The Km and Vmax for 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid was 0.16 mM and 0.48 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. Of the substrates tested, the BA7 alpha D used only 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid as substrates. A molecular modeling program (SYBYL) was used to calculate the energy differences between the various intermediates in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway. A marked energy difference (-9.4 kcal/mol) was observed between 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 12 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4,6-choldienoic acid, possibly accounting for the apparent irreversibility of the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase reaction under our experimental conditions. No significant amino acid sequence homologies were found between BA7 alpha D and other proteins in the data base; however, BA7 alpha D does contain a lipocalin signature sequence, possibly indicating a bile acid binding domain. The bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase appears to be a unique enzyme in the bacterial bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway.
TI  - Anaerobic Desulfonation of 4-Tolylsulfonate and 2-(4-Sulfophenyl) Butyrate by a Clostridium sp.
AB  - Alkyl- and arylsulfonates were tested as sole added sources of sulfur for the growth of enrichment cultures under strictly anaerobic denitrifying or fermentative conditions. Cultures that utilized taurine, ethylsulfonate, the dyestuffs orange II and acid red I, tolylsulfonate, 2-(4-sulfophenyl)butyrate (SPB), a dialkyltetralinesulfonate, and 1-(4-sulfophenyl)octane were readily obtained. We chose to work with the simple aromatic compounds and isolated a fermentative bacterium, strain EV4, which utilized SPB as the sole added source of sulfur in glucose-mineral medium. The organism was identified as a Clostridium sp. related to Clostridium beijerinckii. Clostridium sp. strain EV4 utilized seven of seven tested arylsulfonates quantitatively. The growth yield was about 3 kg of protein per mol of sulfur, whether sulfonate or sulfate was utilized. A major product specific to each sulfonate could be observed. Although no product was identified, the existence of anaerobic desulfonation has been established.
TI  - Characterization of 16S rRNA genes from oil field microbial communities indicates the presence of a variety of sulfate-reducing, fermentative, and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria.
AB  - Oil field bacteria were characterized by cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified  16S rRNA genes. A variety of gram-negative, sulfate-reducing bacteria was detected (16 members of the family Desulfovibrionaceae and 8 members of the family Desulfobacteriaceae). In contrast, a much more limited number of anaerobic, fermentative, or acetogenic bacteria was found (one Clostridium sp., one Eubacterium sp., and one Synergistes sp.). Potential sulfide oxidizers and/or microaerophiles (Thiomicrospira, Arcobacter, Campylobacter, and Oceanospirillum spp.) were also detected. The first two were prominently amplified from uncultured production water DNA and represented 28 and 47% of all clones, respectively. Growth on media containing sulfide as the electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor and designed for the isolation of Thiomicrospira spp. gave only significant enrichment of the Campylobacter sp., which was shown to be present in different western Canadian oil fields. This newly discovered sulfide oxidizer may provide a vital link in the oil field sulfur cycle by reoxidizing sulfide formed by microbial sulfate or sulfur reduction.
TI  - An inhibitor of S-hemolysin, SHI, produced by streptomyces sp. strain No. 6288.
AB  - Streptomyces sp. strain No. 6288 produces S-Hemolysin, which is a unique phospholipase C with a high substrate specificity for sphingomyelin. Moreover, the strain also produced two kinds of phospholipase inhibitors, designated as SHI and S-PLI, in different phases of cultivation. The purified SHI was shown to be a basic substance containing an amino group and glycoside moiety, and it was a more effective inhibitor of S-Hemolysin and sphingomyelinase from Streptomyces sp. with a higher substrate specificity for sphingomyelin than alpha-toxin from Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Tungsten in biological systems.
AB  - Tungsten (atomic number 74) and the chemically analogous and very similar metal molybdenum (atomic number 42) are minor yet equally abundant elements on this planet. The essential role of molybdenum in biology has been known for decades and molybdoenzymes are ubiquitous. Yet, it is only recently that a biological role for tungsten has been established in prokaryotes, although not as yet in eukaryotes. The best characterized organisms with regard to their metabolism of tungsten are certain species of hyperthermophilic archaea (Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis), methanogens (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Mb. wolfei), Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium thermoaceticum, C. formicoaceticum and Eubacterium acidaminophilum), Gram-negative anaerobes (Desulfovibrio gigas and Pelobacter acetylenicus) and Gram-negative aerobes (Methylobacterium sp. RXM). Of these, only the hyperthermophilic archaea appear to be obligately tungsten-dependent. Four different types of tungstoenzyme have been purified: formate dehydrogenase, formyl methanufuran dehydrogenase, acetylene hydratase, and a class of phylogenetically related oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of aldehydes. These are carboxylic reductase, and three ferredoxin-dependent oxidoreductases which oxidize various aldehydes, formaldehyde and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. All tungstoenzymes catalyze redox tungsten in these enzymes is bound by a pterin moiety similar to that found in molybdoenzymes. The first crystal structure of a tungsten- or pterin-containing enzyme, that of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase from P. furiosus, has revealed a catalytic site with one W atom coordinated to two pterin molecules which are themselves bridged by a magnesium ion. The geochemical, ecological, biochemical and phylogenetic basis for W- vs. Mo-dependent organisms is discussed.
TI  - Increased substance P receptor expression by blood vessels and lymphoid aggregates in Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis.
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis is most often caused by toxins secreted by Clostridium difficile following bowel flora overgrowth after antibiotic use. The secretory and inflammatory effects observed in C. difficile toxin A-induced enterocolitis in the rat ileum are inhibited by CP-96,345, a substance P (SP) receptor antagonist. To determine if SP plays a role in the pathogenesis of human pseudomembranous colitis, SP receptor distribution was examined in a toxin A-positive specimen of bowel. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine SP receptors in tissue from a patient who tested positive for C. Difficile toxin. SP receptors were massively increased in small blood vessels and lymphoid aggregates in the pseudomembranous colitis bowel in comparison to control specimens. The SP binding was saturable and exhibited similar affinities for SP and CP-96,345. SP may contribute to the inflammatory response in pseudomembranous colitis via a massive increase in SP receptor antagonists may offer a novel therapeutic intervention for pseudomembranous colitis.
TI  - A conformational change in the methyltransferase from Clostridium thermoaceticum  facilitates the methyl transfer from (6S)-methyltetrahydrofolate to the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein in the Acetyl-CoA pathway.
AB  - The methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase (MeTr) from Clostridium thermoaceticum catalyzes the methylation of a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) by the N5 methyl group of (6S)-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate). This is an important reaction in the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. The forward and reverse reactions of MeTr have a pH dependence that appears to reflect protonation of a group on the protein [Zhao, S., Roberts, D. L., & Ragsdale, S. W. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 15075-15083]. In the work reported here, fluorescence and rapid reaction kinetics were used to demonstrate that this protonation elicits a rate-limiting conformational change. As the pH was lowered, the emission maximum for intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence underwent a red shift (pK(a) = 5.4) and the emission intensity increased (pK(a) = 5.1). The extrinsic fluorescence probe, 4,4'-bis-1-phenylamino-8-napthalenesulfonate (bis-ANS) was used to report on the conformational change. The bis-ANS fluorescence was strongly enhanced upon binding MeTr. As the pH was decreased, the fluorescence was further enhanced and the emission maximum underwent a 14 nm blue shift (pK(a) = 5.0). By stopped-flow fluorescence studies, it was shown that these fluorescence changes occur at rates similar to the k(cat) for the MeTr reaction and thus reflect catalytically competent events. The combined results indicate that CH3-H4folate binds to a hydrophobic region in MeTr that includes a tryptophan residue(s). MeTr undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change that exposes this region to solvent and facilitates substrate binding.
TI  - Hepatic abscesses in dogs: 14 cases (1982-1994).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. RESULTS: Anorexia and lethargy were the most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. Hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. Serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. Abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. Thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. Hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. Concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. Seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. One dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. Six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). Five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. Ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. Medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.
TI  - Equine intestinal clostridiosis in a group of polo ponies in Dubai, U.A.E.
AB  - An acute outbreak of a C. perfringens Type C enterotoxemia in a polo club killed  8 polo ponies in less than 24 hours. Hay with a massive fungal contamination (Aspergillus and Fusarium sp.) is suspected to have triggered the enterotoxemia. Our cases show numerous similarities with the previously reported cases of EIC. However, acute toxic tubulonephrosis in the necropsied horses and longstanding elevation of AST and gamma GT-levels in survivors is unique in our cases.
TI  - Prospective characterization of the clinicopathologic and immunologic features of an immunodeficiency syndrome affecting juvenile llamas.
AB  - The clinicopathologic and immunologic features of 15 llamas affected with juvenile llama immunodeficiency syndrome (JLIDS) are described. Healthy adult (n = 10) and juvenile (n = 10) llamas served as controls. JLIDS llamas were characterized by wasting, and clinically apparent, repeated infections were frequently observed. The median age at which a health problem was first perceived was 11.6 months. All 15 affected llamas died or were killed, and JLIDS was confirmed at necropsy. The median duration of illness was 3.5 months. Lymphocyte blastogenesis assays showed suppressed responses (particularly to Staphylococcus sp. Protein A) in JLIDS llamas. No evidence of retroviral infection was detected. Mild, normocytic, normochromic, non-regenerative anemia, low serum albumin concentration and low to low-normal globulin concentrations were typically found on initial clinical evaluation. Lymph node biopsies showed areas of paracortical depletion. All llamas affected with JLIDS had low serum IgG concentrations, pre-vaccination titers against Clostridium perfringens C and D toxoids of < or = 1:100, and no titer increase following vaccination.
TI  - Mechanistic studies of the methyltransferase from Clostridium thermoaceticum: origin of the pH dependence of the methyl group transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein.
AB  - A methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase (MeTr) from Clostridium thermoaceticum catalyzes the transfer of the N5 methyl group from (6S)-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to the cobalt center of a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP). The methylcobamide product is the first in a series of enzyme-bound organometallic intermediates in the acetyl-CoA pathway of anaerobic CO2 fixation. The mechanisms of the forward and reverse reactions with CH3-H4folate and either the C/Fe-SP or vitamin B12 as substrates were studied by steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics. This ability to effectively utilize free cobalamin as well as the C/Fe-SP in the transmethylation appears to explain why [14C]methylcobyric acid was found as a product of labeling C. thermoaceticum cells with 14CO2 [Ljungdahl, L. G., Irion, E., & Wood, H. G. (1965) Biochemistry 4, 2771-2780]. Stopped-flow experiments indicate that the Co(I)-C/Fe-SP performs a direct SN2 displacement of the methyl group of CH3-H4folate to form H4folate and methyl-Co(III). The pre-steady-state rate constants in the forward and reverse reactions increased as the pH was lowered (pKa approximately 5.5). Similar pH profiles were obtained by steady-state kinetics. The kcat/Km values for the C/Fe-SP and CH3-H4folate in the forward direction and for the methylated C/Fe-SP and H4folate in the reverse direction increased as the pH was lowered (pKa approximately 5.3). A different pH profile was obtained with free cobalamin as the substrate; the kcat/Km for CH3-H4folate and cobalamin (forward reaction) increased (pKa approximately 7.0) and the kcat/Km for H4folate and methylcobalamin (reverse reaction) decreased (pKa approximately 5.3) as the pH was lowered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [A new psychroactive bacterium, Clostridium fimentarium, isolated from cattle manure fermented at a low temperature].
AB  - A new psychroactive saccharolytic anaerobic organism was isolated from cattle manure digested at 6 degrees C. The organism is a Gram-positive oligosporous motile rod measuring 0.5-0.6 by 2.1-5.0 microns. It utilizes glucose, fructose, maltose, arabinose, xylose, cellobiose, galactose, and mannose. Fermentation products are acetate, ethanol, lactate, formate, H2, and CO2. Growth is possible within a temperature range of 1-30 degrees C, with an optimum at 20-25 degrees C, and a pH range of 5.5-8.3, with an optimum at 6.8. The DNA GC content is 35.6 mol %. The organism was classified as a new species of the genus Clostridium, C. fimetarium sp. nov. The type strain is Z-2189.
TI  - Alcohol dehydrogenase: multiplicity and relatedness in the solvent-producing clostridia.
AB  - Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a key enzyme for the production of butanol, ethanol, and isopropanol by the solvent-producing clostridia. Initial studies of ADH in extracts of several strains of Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii gave conflicting molecular properties. A more coherent picture has emerged because of the following results: (i) identification of ADHs with different coenzyme specificities in these species; (ii) discovery of structurally conserved ADHs (type 3) in three solvent-producing species; (iii) isolation of mutants with deficiencies in butanol production and restoration of butanol production with a cloned alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase gene; and (iv) resolution of various 'C. acetobutylicum' cultures into four species. The three ADH isozymes of C. beijerinckii NRRL B592 have high sequence similarities to ADH-1 of Clostridium sp. NCP 262 (formerly C. acetobutylicum P262) and to the ADH domain of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824/DSM 792. The NADH-dependent activity of the ADHs from C. beijerinckii NRRL B592 and the BDHs from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is profoundly affected by the pH of the assay, and the relative importance of NADH and NADPH to butanol production may be misappraised when NAD(P)H-dependent activities were measured at different pH values. The primary/secondary ADH of isopropanol-producing C. beijerinckii is a type-1 enzyme and is highly conserved in Thermoanaerobacter brockii (formerly Thermoanaerobium brockii) and Entamoeba histolytica. Several solvent-forming enzymes (primary ADH, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase) are very similar between C. beijerinckii and the species represented by Clostridium sp. NCP 262 and NRRL B643. The realization of such relationships will facilitate the elucidation of the roles of different ADHs because each type of ADH can now be studied in an organism most amenable to experimental manipulations.
TI  - Acetogenesis from dichloromethane by a two-component mixed culture comprising a novel bacterium.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic two-component culture able to grow exponentially with a doubling time of 20 h on a medium containing dichloromethane as the carbon and energy source was characterized. On a medium without sulfate, we observed (per mol of dichloromethane) a mass balance of 2 mol of chloride, 0.26 mol of acetate, 0.05 mol of formate, and 0.25 mol of carbon in biomass. One component of the culture, strain DMB, was identified by a 16S ribosomal DNA analysis as a Desulfovibrio sp. The other component, the gram-positive organism strain DMC, could not be isolated. It was possible, however, to associate strain DMC on a medium containing dichloromethane in a coculture with Acetobacterium woodii or Methanospirillum hungatei. Coculture of strain DMC with the Archaeon M. hungatei allowed us to specifically amplify by PCR the 16S rRNA gene of strain DMC. A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence revealed that this organism groups within the radiation of the Clostridium-Bacillus subphylum and exhibits the highest levels of sequence similarity (89%) with Desulfotomaculum orientis and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans. Since the novel organism strain DMC was able to grow acetogenically with dichloromethane when it was associated with one of three metabolically different partners and since, in contrast to strain DMB, strain DMC contained carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity, this bacterium is responsible for both the dehalogenation of dichloromethane and the acetogenesis observed in the original two-component culture. The obligatory dependence of strain DMC on a partner during growth with dichloromethane is thought to stem from the need for a growth factor produced by the associated organism.
TI  - Transcriptional induction and expression of the endoglucanase celA gene from a ruminal Clostridium sp. ("C. longisporum").
AB  - Northern (RNA) blot analysis of RNA from Clostridium sp. revealed induction of transcription of the celA gene when barley beta-glucan was used as carbon source, while no celA mRNA was detected after growth on cellobiose. Western blots (immunoblots), prepared by using a rabbit antiserum raised against CelA protein purified from Escherichia coli, revealed the extracellular location of CelA in Clostridium sp. Despite the absence of detectable celA mRNA, significant quantities of CelA were detected in the culture supernatant during growth on cellobiose. This finding indicated a low constitutive expression of celA. A 6.7-fold increase in the total beta-glucanase specific activity in the extracellular fraction was observed during growth on beta-glucan. The transcriptional start site of celA was mapped by extension and was found to be the same in Clostridium sp. and in E. coli expressing the cloned celA gene. A consensus E. coli -10 promoter region (AATAAT), but not a -35 promoter region, could be identified. Two direct repeats (TATTGAATTTAT) separated by 15 nucleotides flank the region where the consensus -35 promoter regions would have been. The size of the celA mRNA transcript corresponded with the size of the open reading frame. A potential stem-loop structure was found 18 nucleotides downstream of the 3' stop codon, which could be responsible for termination of transcription.
TI  - Bacteroides infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1990, 336 Bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. They comprised 180 (54%) B. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) B. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) B. vulgatus, 34 (10%) B. distasonis, 21 (6%) B. ovatus and 10 (3%) B. uniformis. Infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a Bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. Most Bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). Predisposing conditions were present in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). The micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with Bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), Escherichia coli (122), Fusobacterium spp. (38) and Clostridium spp. (30). All patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. All but 12 (5%) patients recovered. These data illustrate the importance of Bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clostridium herbivorans sp. nov., a cellulolytic anaerobe from the pig intestine.
AB  - A new cellulolytic anaerobic clostridium was isolated from the intestinal tract of pigs. The single isolate was a gram-positive, motile rod, formed terminal to subterminal swollen sporangia, and required a fermentable carbohydrate for growth. Cellulose, cellobiose, maltose, starch, and glycogen supported growth, but glucose and fructose did not. The major end products from the fermentation of cellobiose were butyrate and formate; minor amounts of hydrogen and ethanol were also formed. Ruminal fluid (15%) or yeast extract (1%) was required for good growth. The optimum temperature for growth was 39 to 42 degrees C, and the optimum pH was 6.8 to 7.2. Cell lysis occurred rapidly once stationary growth was reached. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the strain was related to a group of gram-positive anaerobes that includes Clostridium oroticum and the cellulolytic species Clostridium polysaccharolyticum and Clostridium populeti. The DNA base composition of the isolate is 38 mol% G + C. We propose the name Clostridium herbivorans for this organism; strain 54408 (= ATCC 49925) is the type strain.
TI  - Phylogenetic evidence that the gram-negative nonsporulating bacterium Tissierella (Bacteroides) praeacuta is a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria and description of Tissierella creatinini sp. nov.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Tissierella praeacuta (formerly  Bacteroides praeacutus) was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that T. praeacuta is a member of the Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria and has a close phylogenetic affinity with the species that form Clostridium cluster XII (M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994). Although T. praeacuta is gram negative and does not produce endospores, 16S rRNA sequence data showed that it is closely related genealogically (level of sequence similarity, 99.9%) to Clostridium hastiforme. On the basis of our results and the results of previous studies, a second species of Tissierella, Tissierella creatinini sp. nov., is described.
TI  - Brain abscess due to Bacillus macerans following a penetrating periorbital injury.
AB  - We report a case of a brain abscess due to Bacillus macerans and Clostridium sp.  following a penetrating periorbital injury by a wooden branch. Intracranial penetration by and retention of a foreign body were not suspected initially, and neurological symptoms developed only 2.5 months later. Previously reported cases of brain abscesses due to Bacillus species are reviewed.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - [Efficiency of microbank systems for the conservation of microorganisms relevant  to veterinary medicine and others which are not easy to cultivate].
AB  - In this paper the conservation of different bacteria, yeasts and molds from diagnostic material was examined with a commercial deep freeze system. 137 bacteria isolated from the stomachs of dogs, cats and pigs and from duodenal juice of cats and 7 isolates of yeasts and fungi from diagnostic material were conserved with the deep freeze system MICROBANK-TM (Mast Diagnostica). Furthermore 62 Helicobacter pylori-isolates and 1 Helicobacter felis-isolate were conserved with this system. After a storage period of 24 hours up to 20 months the isolates were recultured. 96% of the conserved microorganisms could be grown. It was not possible to cultivate 1 fungus-isolate (Fusarium sp.). 2 Helicobacter pylori-isolates, spiral bacteria from the stomach of a pig and a Clostridium tyrobutyricum-isolate were only recultured after 24 hours, 1 isolate Moraxella sp. after 2 months and another 4 anaerobe isolates after 5 months. The system MICROBANK-TM proved to be suitable for conservation and was also efficient for the conservation of microorganisms, which could not easily be cultivated.
TI  - Structural and electronic factors in heterolytic cleavage: formation of the Co(I) intermediate in the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum.
AB  - We have completed the first direct structural characterization of an enzyme-bound four-coordinate Co(I) intermediate, in this case for the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray edge spectroscopy of the active Co(I) state of the C/Fe-SP indicates a four-coordinate (distorted) square-planar structure where the best fit gives average Co-N(equatorial) distances of 1.87 +/- 0.01 A, corresponding to 4.2 +/- 0.3 ligands. The X-ray edge spectrum of Co(I) C/Fe-SP contains a moderate intensity 1s-4p + "shake-down" (SD) transition and no 1s-3d peak (where SD transitions are indicative of square-planar geometries). X-ray edge results for the methyl-Co(III) form, reported earlier [Wirt, M. D., Kumar, M., Ragsdale, S. W., & Chance, M. R. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 2146-2150], are consistent with a base-off methylcobamide structure. The absence of a ligated 5-methoxybenzimidazole base in the methyl-Co(III) state is important since the base-off form is predicted to predispose the Co-C bond toward heterolytic cleavage to form the four-coordinate Co(I) species concurrent with methyl transfer. Additionally, we have examined first-derivative X-ray edge spectra of Co(I) C/Fe-SP, relative to edge spectra of a cobalt foil, as an indicator of effective nuclear charge on cobalt. The Co(I) C/Fe-SP edge position at 7720.5 +/- 0.3 eV is less than, but very close to, the value seen for the corresponding free Co(I) cobalamin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical material to ciprofloxacin].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of bacteria  species isolated from different specimens of clinical materials. The investigated strains (830) were identified using conventional methods. The antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied by the method of drug dilution in Mueller-Hinton agar. Among aerobic bacteria, only 5 strains (0.6%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin in concentration 4 micrograms/ml; two belonged to E. coli species, two to S. aureus and one was a Streptococcus group B., Corynebacterium sp. MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml turned out to be most resistant, next, Gram-negative rods MIC90 = 0.5 microgram/ml, coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci and Neisseria sp. MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml. Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobes were the least susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Their MIC90 was 2 and 16 micrograms/ml respectively. Among 20 anaerobic strains, up to 10 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, mainly from Bacteroides and Clostridium genus.
TI  - Purification and properties of crystalline 3-methylaspartase from two facultative anaerobes, Citrobacter sp. strain YG-0504 and Morganella morganii strain YG-0601.
AB  - 3-Methylaspartase (3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase, EC 4.3.1.2) from two facultative anaerobes from soil, Citrobacter sp. strain YG-0504 and Morganella morganii strain YG-0601, were purified and crystallized from their crude extracts. Both of the Citrobacter and Morganella enzymes appeared to be a dimer of subunits of M(r) 40,000 and 44,000, respectively. The enzymes had similar enzymological properties: optimum pH for the deamination reaction of (2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid, substrate specificity, inhibitor, divalent and monovalent cation requirement, and N-terminal amino acid sequence homology. However, some differences were detected in pH and temperature stability, optimum pH for the amination reaction of mesaconic acid, optimum temperature, specific activity, and stability during electrophoresis. Both enzymes had similar enzymological properties to the known 3-methylaspartase from an obligate anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium tetanomorphum H1, except kinetic constants and substrate specificities.
TI  - The reductive acetyl coenzyme A pathway: sequence and heterologous expression of  active methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase from Clostridium thermoaceticum.
AB  - The methyltransferase (MeTr) from Clostridium thermoaceticum transfers the N5-methyl group of (6S)-methyltetrahydrofolate to the cobalt center of a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein in the acetyl coenzyme A pathway. MeTr was purified to homogeneity and shown to lack metals. The acsE gene encoding MeTr was sequenced and actively expressed in Escherichia coli at a level of 9% of cell protein. Regions in the sequence of MeTr and the E. coli cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase were found to share significant homology, suggesting that they may represent tetrahydrofolate-binding domains.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a chromosomal fragment from Clostridium acetobutylicum  strain ABKn8 conferring chemical-damaging agents and UV resistance to E. coli recA strains.
AB  - A 3.3-kb DNA fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum conferred methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), mitomycin C (MC), and UV resistance to recA strains of E. coli when cloned on the pUC19 plasmid. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the total insert and results of in vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that the insert directed the synthesis of three polypeptides referred to as ORFa, ORFb, and ORFc of 23.6, 15.3, and 21 kDa, respectively. None of the polypeptides presented a relationship with the RecA protein of E. coli or products of genes involved in the SOS response. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORFb and ORFc are highly homologous to those deduced from two genes specifying resistance to tellurium salts present on plasmid pMER610 harbored by Alcaligenes sp.strains and to an AMP-binding protein (CABP1) found in Dictyostelium discoideum. The existence of these homologous proteins suggests that they may perform a similar key function in the three unrelated organisms.
TI  - Characterization of a psychrotrophic Clostridium causing spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked pork: description of Clostridium algidicarnis sp. nov.
AB  - A Clostridium species causing spoilage of vacuum-packed refrigerated pork was isolated and characterized. The unknown organism differed phenotypically from other clostridial species usually associated with spoilage. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the psychrotroph represents a distinct line of descent within the genus Clostridium. It is proposed that the organism be classified as a new species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium algidicarnis.
TI  - [Etiology, diagnosis and course of infectious diarrhea in the Liestal canton hospital (5-year retrospective study)].
AB  - Between 1987 and 1991 219 patients (1.3% of all hospitalized patients) with acute infectious diarrhea were investigated retrospectively. 52% of the patients were hospitalized and 48% were outpatients. In 55% the inducing diarrhea microorganism could be identified. The most frequently detected pathogens were endemic Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter jejuni (65%). Imported diarrheas (Shigella sp. and parasites) were rare, as only 15% of the patients had a history of travel. All Clostridium difficile infections were associated with antibiotic treatment. The stool examinations for bacteria were positive in 92/160 patients (57%). Stool examinations for occult blood or fecal leukocytes were highly useful in detecting the infectious agent. In 70% of the patients with positive occult blood test or 81% of the patients with fecal leukocytes, an infectious agent in the stool was found. All patients recovered with few complications. 31% of the patients were treated by antibiotics because of septic disease or pathogenic parasites.
TI  - Necrotizing enterocolitis in the extremely low birth weight infant.
AB  - Improved neonatal management has resulted in an enlarging population of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. These infants have a high incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and a high mortality rate. The authors compared two groups of NEC patients: ELBW infants (< 1,000 g and/or < or = 28 weeks' gestation) and "standard" premature infants (29 to 36 weeks' gestation). NEC was classified according to the extent of bowel involvement: (1) focal, (2) diffuse, or (3) pan involvement (pan necrosis). Clinical laboratory, radiological, pathological, and bacteriologic findings, management, and mortality were analyzed. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to gender, race, delivery mode, or incidence of prenatal or perinatal problems. The most common presenting signs in both groups were abdominal distension, vomiting, and feeding intolerance. The onset of signs and the time of first feedings were significantly later in the ELBW group. Pneumatosis was the most frequent initial radiological finding (60% of the ELBW group, 75% of the premature group). Portal vein air (PVA) was present in 29% of the ELBW and premature infants. Seventy-one percent of ELBW infants with PVA had pan involvement, versus 40% of premature infants (P < .05). There were significant differences in the peritoneal cultures between the groups. The premature group had significantly more Escherichia coli (54% v 23%). The ELBW group had a wider variety of microorganisms (eg, Clostridium sp, Pseudomonas sp, and yeast). Survival was significantly higher for the premature group (84% v 55%). The mortality rate was 93% when pan involvement was present in the ELBW group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Description of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus gen. nov., sp. nov: an obligately anaerobic, extremely thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium.
AB  - A new obligately anaerobic, extremely thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium is described. The strain designated Tp8T 6331 is differentiated from thermophilic cellulolytic clostridia on the basis of physiological characteristics and phylogenetic position within the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive bacteria. Strain Tp8T 6331 is assigned to a new genus Caldicellulosiruptor, as Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus gen., nov., sp. nov.
TI  - XPS and XANES Studies of Uranium Reduction by Clostridium sp.
AB  
TI  - Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum sp. nov., an amino acid-utilizing, hydroxybenzoate-decarboxylating bacterium isolated from methanogenic freshwater pond sediment.
AB  - Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum JW/Z-1T (= ATCC 51151 = DSM 7310)) (T = type strain), isolated from freshwater pond sediment, is a nonmotile, gram type-positive, spore-forming, amino acid-utilizing, anaerobic rod. This bacterium produces two inducible enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of para-hydroxybenzoates. The phenols produced are not utilized. C. hydroxybenzoicum requires yeast extract for growth. Sugars are not utilized. Sodium ions and acetic acid stimulate growth. The optimal temperature and optimal pH for growth are 33 to 34 degrees C and 7.2 to 8.2, respectively. The DNA base composition of the type strain is 35.5 mol% guanine plus cytosine, whereas the DNA base compositions of the type strains of Clostridium sticklandii and Clostridium aminovalericum are 33 and 33.5 mol% guanine plus cytosine, respectively, as determined by a chemical method. 16S rRNA sequence analysis groups strain JW/Z-1T most closely with Clostridium purinolyticum and Clostridium acidurici (10.6 and 11 inferred changes per 100 bases, respectively). However, C. hydroxybenzoicum does not utilize uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, or guanine. The cell wall type is A1 alpha (L-Lys direct).
TI  - Efficacy of Clostridium bifermentans serovar Malaysia on target and nontarget organisms.
AB  - Clostridium bifermentans serovar malaysia (C.b.m.) is highly toxic to mosquito larvae. In this study, the following aquatic nontarget invertebrates were treated with high C.b.m. concentrations (up to 1,600-fold the toxic concentration for Anopheles stephensi) to study their susceptibility towards the bacterial toxin: Planorbis planorbis (Pulmonata); Asellus aquaticus (Isopoda); Daphnia pulex (Cladocera); Cloeon dipterum (Ephemeroptera); Plea leachi (Heteroptera); and Eristalis sp., Chaoborus crystallinus, Chironomus thummi, and Psychoda alternata (Diptera). In addition, bioassays were performed with mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex pipiens). Psychoda alternata larvae were very susceptible, with LC50/LC90 values comparable to those of mosquito larvae (about 10(3)-10(5) spores/ml). The tests with Chaoborus crystallinus larvae showed significant mortality rates at high concentrations, but generally not before 4 or 5 days after treatment. The remaining nontarget organisms did not show any susceptibility. The investigation confirms the specificity of C.b.m. to nematocerous Diptera.
TI  - Functional roles of Trp337 and Glu632 in Clostridium glucoamylase, as determined  by chemical modification, mutagenesis, and the stopped-flow method.
AB  - Chemical modification of glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3) from Clostridium sp. G0005 (CGA) with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) was carried out in the presence or absence of an inhibitor, acarbose. CGA lost its catalytic activity through NBS oxidation in the absence of acarbose. The absorbance change at 280 nm suggested that acarbose protects about 2 Trp residues from NBS oxidation. We performed peptide mapping analysis to identify the protected Trp residues, and Trp321, Trp337, Trp433, and Trp569 were identified as candidates to be protected by acarbose. These 4 Trp residues were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis with Phe. The Trp337-->Phe mutant showed very weak catalytic activity, so Trp337 is proposed as an important residue for the catalytic activity. Further, we constructed a Glu632-->Gln mutant. Glu632 is the putative catalytic base. The presteady-state kinetics of the Trp337-->Phe and Glu632-->Gln mutants and the wild-type CGA were investigated using maltotriose as a substrate. The reaction of wild-type CGA can be explained as one involving three intermediates. On the other hand, the two mutants' reactions are explained by a two-step mechanism lacking the third intermediate. Trp337 and Glu632 appear to be crucial for the formation of the third intermediate in the wild-type reaction, which precedes the transition state.
TI  - Clostridium thermoalcaliphilum sp. nov., an anaerobic and thermotolerant facultative alkaliphile.
AB  - An anaerobic and thermophilic alkaliphile, strain JW/YL23-2T (T = type strain), was isolated from sewage sludge obtained from a sewage plant in Atlanta, Ga. At pH 10.1 and 50 degrees C, the doubling time of this strain was 19 min. Strain JW/YL23-2T, a motile rod-shaped bacterium with 2 to 12 peritrichous flagella, exhibited a negative Gram stain reaction but was gram-type positive as judged by the polymyxin B test. No heat-stable (85 degrees C, 15 min) endospores were detected. At 50 degrees C, growth occurred at pH values ranging from 7.0 to 11.0; the optimum pH was 9.6 to 10.1. The temperature range for growth ranged from 27 to 57.5 degrees C; the optimum temperature was 48 to 51 degrees C (pH 10.1). Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was not detected. The organism utilized glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, and Casamino Acids. The DNA G+C content was 32 mol% (as determined by chemical analysis). A 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed a 2% inferred evolutionary distance to Clostridium paradoxum. However, the cell wall type of strain JW/YL23-2T was A4 beta (L-Orn-D-Asp), while that of C. paradoxum was A1 tau (m-diaminopimelic acid direct). On the basis of the alkaline pH values and high temperatures for optimal growth, the inability to form spores, and other characteristics different from C. paradoxum characteristics, strain JW/YL-23-2 was placed in a new species, Clostridium thermoalcaliphilum; JW/YL23-2 (= DSM 7309) is the type strain of this new species.
TI  - The role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods (Bacteroides sp., Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. The pathogenicity of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, and AFGPC was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. Thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and AFGPC-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. As determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made Gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and also between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - Clostridium grantii sp. nov., a new obligately anaerobic, alginolytic bacterium isolated from mullet gut.
AB  - A gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped, strictly anaerobic, sporulating bacterium was isolated from an enrichment initiated with mullet gut contents. The organism grew optimally at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5, and at a salinity of 1/10(3). Out of a variety of polysaccharides tested as growth substrates, only alginate supported growth in either semidefined or complex culture medium. The organism also grew on a variety of mono- and disaccharides. Moles product per 100 mol of alginate monomer degraded were: acetate, 186; ethanol, 19; formate, 54; and CO2, 0.19. Moles product per 100 mol of hexose in cellobiose or glucose degraded were: acetate, 135; ethanol, 61; formate, 63; and CO2, 61. Hydrogen was not detectable during the incubations (detection limit, < 10(-5) atm) and propionate, butyrate, lactate, or succinate were not produced as fermentation end products (< 2 mol per 100 mol of monomer). The G+C content of DNA from the bacterium was 30.2 +/- 0.3 mol%, and the cell walls contained the peptidoglycan component meso-diaminopimelic acid. A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence indicated that the organism grouped closely with members of the RNA-DNA homology group 1 of the genus Clostridium. However, it differed from other species of the genus with regard to morphology, growth temperature optimum, substrate range, and fermentation pattern and is therefore designated as a new species of Clostridium; the type strain is A-1 (DSM 8605).
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Cloning of an endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase gene, celA, from the rumen bacterium Clostridium sp. ('C. longisporum') and characterization of its product, CelA, in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium sp. ('C. longisporum') ATCC 49440 in the host Escherichia coli was screened for endo-beta-glucanases, and plasmids pCM64 and pCM4 were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of a 3620 bp fragment was found to contain a 1548 bp open reading frame (ORF), termed celA, which encodes an endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase, CelA, assigned to family A4. N-terminal amino acid sequence determination revealed that pCM64 encoded the full-length celA gene, including a signal sequence, while pCM4 carried a 5'-truncated celA gene expressed as an N-terminal fusion protein, CelA delta N', without a signal sequence. CelA was secreted into the periplasm in E. coli. In this organism, proteolytic cleavage of CelA at or near a putative linker region resulted in the appearance of two active polypeptides of molecular masses 57 and 47 kDa. The former was the full-length enzyme while the latter consisted of the catalytic domain from which the cellulose-binding domain (CBD) had been removed (CelA delta CBD). The intracellularly-located CelA delta N' was not subject to proteolytic degradation. The pH and temperature optima of CelA were pH 4.8 and 43 degrees C, respectively. CelA hydrolysed barley beta-glucan, lichenan, carboxymethylcellulose and xylan. It showed preferential activity against the larger cellooligosaccharides (cellohexaose and cellopentaose); cellotetraose was the smallest substrate degraded completely.
TI  - Culture of intraluminal thrombus during abdominal aortic aneurysm resection: significant contamination is rare.
AB  - The significance of positive bacterial cultures from intraluminal thrombus in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial. Over the last 4 years, thrombus was cultured during aneurysm repair in 116 patients. All patients received cephalosporin antibiotic before and for 48 h after operation. Although none of the aneurysms appeared to be clinically infected, six patients (5.2%) had positive cultures. Four groups were identified based on the bacteria cultured: group I, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth (three patients); group II, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth and 'Streptococcus viridans' (one patient); group III, Bacillus sp., heavy growth (Gram-negative stain) (one patient); group IV, Clostridium perfringens, occasional growth (one patient). One of the six patients died during resection; the other five are alive without graft infection at 5-24 (mean 12) months after operation. The absence of graft infection suggests that positive cultures were not clinically significant or were adequately covered by the antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of positive cultures was lower than previously reported. Routine culture of aneurysm thrombus in the absence of clinical infection is probably not cost-effective.
TI  - Increase of mannose residues, as Salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with Eimeria tenella.
AB  - To study increase of the Salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with Eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. Inhibition of S typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (D-mannose, D-galactose, L-fucose, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. Only D-mannose had inhibitory effects. Whereas, D-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of S typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose inhibited adherence of S typhimurium. D-Mannose significantly (P < 0.05) increased adherence of Bacteroides sp. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of Clostridium perfringens and Bifidobacterium thermophilum. Under microscopic observation, only concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. In E tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. These results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.
TI  - Purification and some properties of an alkaline xylanase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain 41M-1.
AB  - An alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain, 41M-1, isolated from soil produced multiple  xylanases extracellularly. One of these xylanases was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. The moleculr mass of this enzyme (xylanase J) was 36 kDa, and the isoelectric point was pH 5.3. Xylanase J was most active at pH 9.0. The optimum temperature for the activity at pH 9.0 was around 50 degrees C. The enzyme was stable up to 55 degrees C at pH 9.0 for 30 min. Xylanase J was completely inhibited by the Hg2+ion and N-bromosuccinimide. The predominant products of xylan hydrolysate were xylobiose, xylotriose, and higher oligosaccharides, indicating that the enzyme was an endoxylanase. The apparent Km and Vmax values on xylan were 3.3 mg/ml and 1,100 micromol-1 mg-1, respectively. Xylanase J showed high sequence homology with the xylanases from Bacillus pumilus and Clostridium acetobutylicum in the N-terminal region. Xylanase J acted on neither crystalline cellulose nor carboxymethyl cellulose, indicating a possible application of the enzyme in biobleaching processes.
TI  - Value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  - Tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp.). To determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients), treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. Attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. On average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. The common organisms were as expected: Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sp. Although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity of Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.
TI  - Assignment of fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria to Syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov. on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence analyses.
AB  - After enrichment from Chinese rural anaerobic digestor sludge, anaerobic, sporing and nonsporing, saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria were isolated as cocultures with H2- and formate-utilizing Methanospirillum hungatei or Desulfovibrio sp. strain G-11. The syntrophs degraded C4 to C8 saturated fatty acids, including isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate. They were adapted to grow on crotonate and were isolated as pure cultures. The crotonate-grown pure cultures alone did not grow on butyrate in either the presence or the absence of some common electron acceptors. However, when they were reconstituted with M. hungatei, growth on butyrate again occurred. In contrast, crotonate-grown Clostridium kluyveri and Clostridium sticklandii, as well as Clostridium sporogenes, failed to grow on butyrate when these organisms were cocultured with M. hungatei. The crotonate-grown pure subcultures of the syntrophs described above were subjected to 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Several previously documented fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs grown in pure cultures with crotonate were also subjected to comparative sequence analyses. The sequence analyses revealed that the new sporing and nonsporing isolates and other syntrophs that we sequenced, which had either gram-negative or gram-positive cell wall ultrastructure, all belonged to the phylogenetically gram-positive phylum. They were not closely related to any of the previously known subdivisions in the gram-positive phylum with which they were compared, but were closely related to each other, forming a new subdivision in the phylum. We recommend that this group be designated Syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov.; a description is given.
TI  - Clostridium ljungdahlii sp. nov., an acetogenic species in clostridial rRNA homology group I.
AB  - Clostridium ljungdahlii sp. nov. strain ATCC 49587T (T = type strain) was isolated from chicken yard waste for its ability to produce ethanol from synthesis gas. This gram-positive, motile, sporeforming rod's metabolism was primarily acetogenic. C. ljungdahlii grew with carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, ethanol, pyruvate, arabinose, xylose, fructose, or glucose. Methanol, ferulic acid, lactate, galactose, and mannose did not support growth. The G+C content was 22 to 23 mol%. C. ljungdahlii is the first acetogen in clostridial 23S rRNA homology group I.
TI  - Sequence and expression of the gene encoding the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum and reconstitution of the recombinant protein to full activity.
AB  - The corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum acts  as a methyl group carrier in the anaerobic acetyl-CoA pathway of CO and CO2 fixation. Consisting of a small (approximately 33 kDa) and a large (approximately 55 kDa) subunit, the C/Fe-SP contains 1 mol of cobalt in a corrinoid cofactor and 1 mol of [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster/mol of alpha beta dimer. Cobalt is the site of methylation, and the [4Fe-4S] center appears to serve an electron transfer function. The genes encoding both subunits have been cloned previously and are located within a gene cluster that includes other genes required for CO2 fixation by anaerobic bacteria. When the genes encoding the C/Fe-SP were expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein was found to be inactive. We report the amino acid sequences of the large and small subunits of the C/Fe-SP based on the DNA sequences of the cloned genes. The [4Fe-4S] cluster was found to be located in the large subunit. Although the primary structural lattice for cobamide binding resides in the small subunit, both subunits are required for formation of a stable cobamide-binding protein. Based on sequence comparisons with other [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins, 3 of the 4 cysteine residues that serve as ligands to the iron sites in the cluster have been located. The two subunits were independently overexpressed in E. coli to a level of 30-50% of cell protein; however, the resulting protein was inactive, lacked stoichiometric amounts of Fe-S cluster, and lacked cobamide. By combining the recombinant subunits, unfolding them with urea, and refolding in the presence of cobamide, iron, and inorganic sulfide, the resulting C/Fe-SP was found to contain stoichiometric amounts of cobamide and [4Fe-4S] cluster and had spectroscopic and enzymatic properties similar to those of the native protein. We expect that the methods developed here may be used for heterologous overexpression and reconstitution of other complex metalloenzymes. The C/Fe-SP was found to utilize with equal efficiency either vitamin B12 or the natural cofactor 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide as a methyl carrier.
TI  - Secretion of a prokaryotic cellulase in bacterial and mammalian cells.
AB  - The catalytic domain of mature Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase E (EGE') and derivatives of the enzyme fused to prokaryote and eukaryote signal peptides (SP), were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Escherichia coli. All three forms of the endoglucanase were secreted into the periplasm of Escherichia coli, but only derivatives of the enzyme containing an N-terminal SP were exported from CHO cells. Extracellular EGE', purified from E. coli and CHO cultures, displayed similar properties suggesting that glycosylation of the enzyme in the eukaryote did not significantly alter the protein's properties. Data presented in this report indicate that mature EGE' contains secretion signals which are recognised only by the E. coli protein export apparatus, suggesting that there are differences in the recognition of certain secretion signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. As mature EGE' does not contain secretion signals recognised by the mammalian cell, membrane translocation of the bacterial cellulase in a higher eukaryote is directed by an N-terminal prokaryotic SP.
TI  - [Studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  - The locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electron microscopy in Peptostreptococcus productus, Clostridium sp. HD-17, Lactobacillus fermentum, Eubacterium aerofaciens and Escherichia cali B. When the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). The spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of SDS. The spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% Triton X-100 for 2 h. These results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon SDS treatment. So it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. Spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. This result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. Fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the spirosome production by E. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.
TI  - Phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, and Clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  - In previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. Three isolates, strains C, FT (T = type strain), and SR, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. On the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. The sequences of strains C, FT, and SR and reference strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium aminovalericum, Acetomaculum ruminis, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium lituseburense, Clostridium acidiurici, and Clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. Strain C, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to P. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. Strain SR, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to C. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. However, strain FT, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and P. anaerobius. On the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain FT warranted designation as a separate species. The closest known relative of strain FT was C. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). Additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain FT were isolated in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Abdominal pain associated with an umbilical abscess in a llama.
AB  - A 3-month-old llama with a presenting complaint of lethargy, anorexia, and a painful, distended abdomen was evaluated. The llama had intermittently strained to defecate during the 3 days prior to admission. Physical examination results, hematologic data and lateral abdominal radiographs were used to diagnose a large umbilical abscess, which was causing a partial obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Under general anesthesia, 3 liters of purulent exudate were drained from the abscess. The abscess cavity was then lavaged with saline solution and its capsule was marsupialized to the skin. Cultures of the abscess content yielded Proteus sp, Streptococcus equisimilis, and Clostridium septicum. Two days after surgery, the llama was drinking, eating, and passing feces. The abscess was lavaged daily for a total of 11 days. Six months after surgery, the llama was the same size as other llamas of the same age, and the owners were pleased with the cosmetic appearance of the ventral abdomen. Umbilical abscesses can vary in size and clinical presentation; they should be recognized as a possible cause of abdominal pain with a potential for causing intestinal obstruction in llamas.
TI  - [The role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  - Altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. Microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species Peptococcus asacharolyticus, Pc. sacharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides asacharolyticus and B. melaninogenicus. The remaining isolates were classified as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium. In the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (Tab. I) were carried out. Their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (Tab. II). Capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (Tab. III). In the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. The anaerobic genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of the samples both species occurred). According to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. Of the latter, those belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are of major importance.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - Syntheses and activities of N-substituted derivatives of siastatin B.
AB  - N-Substituted derivatives of siastatin B have been obtained by a chemical modification. Some derivatives showed potent inhibitory activities against Streptococcus sp. and Clostridium perfringens neuraminidases.
TI  - Development of Thermus-Escherichia shuttle vectors and their use for expression of the Clostridium thermocellum celA gene in Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - We describe the self-selection of replication origins of undescribed cryptic plasmids from Thermus aquaticus Y-VII-51B (ATCC 25105) and a Thermus sp. strain (ATCC 27737) by random insertion of a thermostable kanamycin adenyltransferase cartridge. Once selected, these autonomous replication origins were cloned into the Escherichia coli vector pUC9 or pUC19. The bifunctional plasmids were analyzed for their sizes, relationships, and properties as shuttle vectors for Thermus-Escherichia cloning. Seven different vectors with diverse kanamycin resistance levels, stabilities, transformation efficiencies, and copy numbers were obtained. As a general rule, those from T. aquaticus (pLU1 to pLU4) were more stable than those from the Thermus sp. (pMY1 to pMY3). To probe their usefulness, we used one of the plasmids (pMY1) to clone in E. coli a modified form of the cellulase gene (celA) from Clostridium thermocellum in which the native signal peptide was replaced in vitro by that from the S-layer gene of T. thermophilus HB8. The hybrid product was expressed and exported by E. coli. When the gene was transferred by transformation into T. thermophilus, the cellulase protein was also expressed and secreted at 70 degrees C.
TI  - Taxonomic studies on a psychrophilic Clostridium from vacuum-packed beef: description of Clostridium estertheticum sp. nov.
AB  - Taxonomic studies were performed on an anaerobic Gram-positive, spore-forming, psychrophilic bacterium originally isolated from spoiled vacuum-packed refrigerated beef. Based on the present finding it is proposed that this unknown psychrophilic bacterium be classified as a new species of the genus Clostridium, as Clostridium estertheticum sp. nov. The type strain is NCIMB 12511.
TI  - New selective medium for isolating Clostridium difficile from faeces.
AB  - AIMS: To compare CCFA (cycloserine, cefoxitin fructose agar) with a new selective medium CDMN (containing cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin, and moxalactam) for the isolation of Clostridium difficile after direct faecal culture. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of norfloxacin was determined for 64 strains of C difficile, 17 strains of other Clostridium sp, and 66 various isolates of faecal origin, together with MIC determinations of moxalactam against the 81 strains of Clostridium sp and 15 isolates of Bacteroides sp. Using C difficile agar base with 0.5 g/l of cysteine hydrochloride, norfloxacin and moxalactam were incorporated into the medium and compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile after direct faecal culture. RESULTS: Norfloxacin (12 mg/l) inhibited the growth of enterobacteriaceae and faecal streptococci; moxalactam (32 mg/l) inhibited the growth of most strains of Bacteroides sp tested, together with Clostridium sp other than C difficile. Using the antibiotics in combination (CDMN), the growth and colonial morphology of 64 strains of C difficile were unaffected. When CDMN medium was compared with CCFA for the isolation of C difficile from 832 faeces from inpatients with diarrhoea, the CDMN agar isolated 20% more strains and reduced the number of contaminating colonies by 30%. CONCLUSIONS: CDMN both improves the isolation rate of C difficile from faecal specimens and reduces the growth of other organisms compared with CCFA.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a glucoamylase gene from a thermophilic Clostridium and kinetics of the cloned enzyme.
AB  - Clostridium sp. G0005 produces a cell-bound glucoamylase (CGA). The gene encoding CGA has been sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence begins with a putative 21-residue signal sequence for secretion of bacterial lipoproteins, which suggests that a putative CGA precursor is modified and secreted like other bacterial lipoproteins in Clostridium sp. G0005, and that the modified residue is important in the cell-bound form of mature CGA. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the CGA precursor with known eukaryotic enzymes showed several regions of high similarity in spite of low similarity throughout the overall primary structure. CGA is the first bacterial glucoamylase to be cloned. The CGA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5' non-coding region and the N-terminal coding region of the gene were replaced with the lac promoter. Kinetic studies of the cloned enzyme purified from E. coli were performed with a set of linear malto-oligosaccharides as substrates, and the subsite affinity was calculated from the kinetic parameters. CGA had typical kinetic properties for a glucoamylase, but this bacterial enzyme had higher isomaltose-hydrolyzing activity than other eukaryotic glucoamylases.
TI  - Acetyl-coenzyme A synthesis from methyltetrahydrofolate, CO, and coenzyme A by enzymes purified from Clostridium thermoaceticum: attainment of in vivo rates and identification of rate-limiting steps.
AB  - Many anaerobic bacteria fix CO2 via the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) (Wood) pathway. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), a corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP), methyltransferase (MeTr), and an electron transfer protein such as ferredoxin II play pivotal roles in the conversion of methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate), CO, and CoA to acetyl-CoA. In the study reported here, our goals were (i) to optimize the method for determining the activity of the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, (ii) to evaluate how closely the rate of synthesis of acetyl-CoA by purified enzymes approaches the rate at which whole cells synthesize acetate, and (iii) to determine which steps limit the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis. In this study, CODH, MeTr, C/Fe-SP, and ferredoxin were purified from Clostridium thermoaceticum to apparent homogeneity. We optimized conditions for studying the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and found that when the reaction is dependent upon MeTr, the rate is 5.3 mumol min-1 mg-1 of MeTr. This rate is approximately 10-fold higher than that reported previously and is as fast as that predicted on the basis of the rate of in vivo acetate synthesis. When the reaction is dependent upon CODH, the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis is approximately 0.82 mumol min-1 mg-1, approximately 10-fold higher than that observed previously; however, it is still lower than the rate of in vivo acetate synthesis. It appears that at least two steps in the overall synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CH3-H4folate, CO, and CoA can be partially rate limiting. At optimal conditions of low pH (approximately 5.8) and low ionic strength, the rate-limiting step involves methylation of CODH by the methylated C/Fe-SP. At higher pH values and/or higher ionic strength, transfer of the methyl group of CH3-H4folate to the C/Fe-SP becomes rate limiting.
TI  - Necrotic enteritis in turkeys.
AB  - Three flocks of turkey hens (16,000 each) between 7 and 12 weeks of age experienced outbreaks of necrotic enteritis. Necropsy revealed a dilated duodenum and jejunum with mucosal surfaces covered with a diphtheritic membrane. Intestinal scrapings showed very few oocysts of Eimeria sp. Histopathological findings were compatible with necrotic enteritis but with deeper, more severe lesions than in broiler chickens. Clostridium perfringens was isolated by anaerobic culture from the intestinal contents. Mortality returned to normal after ampicillin or tetracycline was added to the drinking water.
TI  - Characteristics of a new cellulolytic Clostridium sp. isolated from pig intestinal tract.
AB  - Gram-positive, spore-forming, motile, cellulolytic rods were isolated from 10(7)  dilutions of pig fecal samples. The pigs had previously been fed pure cultures of the ruminal cellulolytic organism Clostridium longisporum. Isolates formed terminal to subterminal spores, and a fermentable carbohydrate was required for growth. Besides cellulose, the isolates utilized cellobiose, glycogen, maltose, and starch. However, glucose, fructose, sucrose, pectin, and xylose were not used as energy sources. Major fermentation products included formate and butyrate. The isolates did not digest proteins from gelatin or milk. Unlike C. longisporum, which has limited ability to degrade cell wall components from grasses (switchgrass, bromegrass, and ryegrass), the swine isolates were equally effective in degrading these components from both alfalfa and grasses. The extent of degradation was equal to or better than that observed with the predominant ruminal cellulolytic organisms. On the basis of morphology, motility, spore formation, fermentation products, and the ability to hydrolyze cellulose, the isolates are considered to be a new species of the genus Clostridium. It is unclear whether C. longisporum played a role in the establishment or occurrence of this newly described cellulolytic species. This is the first report of a cellulolytic Clostridium sp. isolated from the pig intestinal tract.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an extracellular muramidase of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 that acts on non-N-acetylated peptidoglycan.
AB  - An extracellular enzyme showing lytic activity on non-N-acetylated peptidoglycan  has been isolated from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The lytic enzyme was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration, with a recovery of 24%. The enzyme was monomeric and had an estimated molecular weight of 41,000 and an isoelectric point of 3.8. It has been characterized as a muramidase whose 23-amino-acid N terminus displayed 39% homology with the N,O-diacetyl muramidase of the fungus Chalaropsis sp. The muramidase hydrolyzed purified cell walls at an optimum pH of 3, with a maximum velocity of 9.1 mumol of reducing sugars released min-1 mg of muramidase-1 and a concentration of cell walls giving a half-maximum rate of 0.01 mg ml-1. Its activity was inhibited by glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, Hg2+, Fe3+, and Ag+ but not by choline. The muramidase-peptidoglycan complex rapidly dissociated before total hydrolysis of the chain and randomly reassociated on another peptidoglycan chain. The affinity of the muramidase was affected by the protein content and the acetylation of the cell wall.
TI  - Supplementation of an adapted formula with bovine lactoferrin: 1. Effect on the infant faecal flora.
AB  - The development of the infant faecal flora was studied over the first three months of life in infants receiving breast milk, a modern adapted formula and adaptations of this formula. Breast-fed infants developed a flora rich in Bifidobacterium sp. Facultative anaerobes were ubiquitous, but in relatively small numbers within the diet group. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteriodes sp. were rarely isolated. Standard formula produced a flora rich in bifidobacteria, but the growth of facultative organisms was not suppressed by this diet. Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. were more common in this feeding group. After the addition of lactoferrin at 10 mg/100 ml to the formula diet, a flora similar to that of the standard formula-fed babies was achieved. Lactoferrin at 100 mg/100 ml was able to establish a "bifidus flora" in half of the babies given this formula, but only at age three months. Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. were common faecal isolates from babies receiving both the lactoferrin diets.
TI  - Production, purification, and characterization of botulinolysin, a thiol-activated hemolysin of Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - A hemolysin, botulinolysin, produced by Clostridium botulinum was purified to homogeneity and characterized. First, a strain of C. botulinum type C, strain C-203 Tox, which produced a large amount of hemolysin, was selected, and optimal culture medium and conditions for its production of hemolysin were determined. The hemolysin produced in the culture supernatant of this strain under optimal conditions was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography, Sephadex G-75 gel permeation chromatography, and SP-Toyopearl 650 M cation-exchange column chromatography, with a recovery of 12%. The purified hemolysin gave a single protein band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein in this band in PAGE with SDS was estimated to have a molecular weight of 58,000 and was immunostained with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In PAGE without SDS, the hemolytic activity corresponded in position to the single protein band. The pI of the hemolysin was 8.4. Amino acid analysis of the purified hemolysin indicated the presence of four half-cystine residues per molecule. The purified hemolysin had a specific activity of 2,100 hemolytic units per microgram of protein on rabbit erythrocytes. It was activated by SH compounds, inhibited by cholesterol, and heat labile. The optimum pH for hemolysis was 6.0 to 7.0. Rabbit, human, and guinea pig erythrocytes were the most susceptible to the hemolysin, while sheep, mouse, rat, and chicken erythrocytes were much less susceptible. The purified hemolysin had a lethal effect in mice and was cytotoxic for some cultured cells: its 50% lethal dose in mice was 310 ng, and its 50% cytotoxic dose for Vero cells was 120 ng/ml.
TI  - Creatinine and N-methylhydantoin degradation in two newly isolated Clostridium species.
AB  - With N-methylhydantoin (NMH) as the main organic substrate, two strictly anaerobic spore forming Gram-positive bacterial strains were isolated from sewage sludge. These strains, named Clostridium sp. FS23 and Clostridium sp. FS41, totally degraded NMH, via N-carbamoylsarcosine (CS) and sarcosine as intermediates. Strain FS23 grew also with creatinine, which was converted to NMH by creatinine iminohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.21). This enzyme was formed at high rates with all substrates tested. Cytosine and 5-fluorocytosine were not utilized as substrates by creatinine iminohydrolase preparations purified to a homogeneity of 98%. NMH amidohydrolase (NMHase) and N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase (CSHase) turned out to be inducible in both strains. Other than in aerobic organisms, NMHase from these two isolated did not require ATP for enzymatic activity. SH-group protecting agents were not necessary for stability.
TI  - Clostridium neopropionicum sp. nov., a strict anaerobic bacterium fermenting ethanol to propionate through acrylate pathway.
AB  - Strain X4 was isolated several years ago from an anaerobic mesophilic plant treating vegetable cannery waste waters. It was the first example of propionic fermentation from ethanol. Morphologic and physiologic characterizations of the strain are presented here. This strain is described as type strain of a new species, Clostridium neopropionicum sp. nov. Whole cells of strain X4 ferment [1-13C] ethanol and CO2 to [2-13C] propionate, [1-13C] acetate and [2-13C] propanol, suggesting the absence of a randomizing pathway during the propionate formation. Enzymes involved in this fermentation were assayed in cell-free extracts of cells grown with ethanol as sole substrate. Alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, phosphate acetyl transferase, acetate kinase, pyruvate synthase, lactate dehydrogenases, and the enzymes of the acrylate pathway were detected at activities sufficient to be involved in ethanol fermentation. The same pathway may be used for the degradation of lactate or acrylate to acetate.
TI  - [Bacteria associated with diarrheic episodes in young camels in Niger].
AB  - During diarrhoeic episodes of young camels in Niger, bacteria such as Salmonella  enteritidis, E. Coli, Staphylococcus sp., Clostridium perfringens and other bacteria were isolated from stool samples. Bacteria roll in this pathology is discussed, and a treatment is proposed, compared with antibiogram results.
TI  - The acute phase of experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 1. The influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain CL of Trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic CFW (LOB) mice monoassociated with Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp or Clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. Significantly earlier parasitemia peak and mortality were observed in Bacteroides fragilis- and Clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). More precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in Peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. The extent of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, B. fragilis-associated, Clostridium-associated, and Peptostreptococcus-associated animals. The levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, Peptostreptococcus-associated, Clostridium-associated, and B. fragilis-associated mice. 4. These results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with T. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. This suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with T. cruzi.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of three different treatments with imipenem versus the classical clindamycin plus tobramycin in experimental peritonitis.
AB  - This study compares the efficacy of three different treatment modalities of imipenem/cilastatin and the conventional clindamycin plus tobramycin in an experimental model of intra-abdominal sepsis. 145 Wistar rats were used. 40 served as control and 105 as study groups. A capsule with 0.5 ml of inoculum was surgically implanted in the peritoneal cavity. The inoculum was prepared from human feces of healthy volunteers, with a composition of E. coli 10(6), E. faecalis 10(6), B. fragilis, Clostridium sp 10(5) to 10(6) and anaerobic streptococci 10(5) to 10(6). Eighty animals were treated with imipenem/cilastatin and divided in 3 subgroups: "short pretreatment"--29 animals treated 1 hour prior to surgery and 3 days after; "short"--26 animals starting treatment 2 hours post-surgery and continuing it for 3 days; and "long"--25 animals treated for 10 days, starting 2 hours post-surgery. 25 animals received clindamycin plus tobramycin for 10 days. Mortality and the presence of visceral and peritoneal abscesses were the endpoints of the study. The control group had 100% mortality. There were no statistically significant differences among the treated groups although lower mortality was obtained with "short pretreatment" and "long" treatment with imipenem. The presence of abscesses were statistically significant between the imipenem and the combination group. In the imipenem groups, the "short pretreatment" and the long treatment had fewer abscesses than the short one. We conclude that imipenem may be a good alternative monotherapy to conventional therapy with clindamycin plus tobramycin. The "short pretreatment" seemed as good as the long one and better than the short treatment.
TI  - [Bacterial translocation in a model of intestinal obstruction. II. Bacteriological study and role of cellular immunity].
AB  - Bacterial translocation (Bt) from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to systemic organs creates the possibility of Infection and sepsis in a great number of pathologic entities. In a mouse model of Intestinal Obstruction (IO), we evaluated the type of micro-organisms and the organs that bacteria frequent translocated. At 24 hours post-10, positive cultures where obtained at the MLN, portal, systemic circulation and peritoneal cavity, establishing that the translocation is bi-directional. The more frequent bacteria isolated were the Streptococcus group D, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., an clostridium. BT occurs at 24 hour post-OI and was due to increased intestinal permeability, at 48 hrs BT increased and related to the physical disruption of the mucosal barrier in the intestinal mucosa. Cell mediated immunity (CMI) response in this model was not altered, although a progressive decrease was observed at 48 hrs it was not significant, suggesting that the CMI play no role in the pathogenesis of BT. In the Control-Laparotomy group, CMI response was increased significantly at 48 hours, suggesting that a simple laparotomy boost the immune defense response.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330.
AB  - The gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from Bacillus sp. KSM-330 was cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb HindIII insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in E. coli HB101. Nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of 1389 bp. The protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an Mr of 51882. The deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through 75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, Endo-K, purified from culture of Bacillus sp. KSM-330. The deduced amino acid sequence of Endo-K had 30% homology with that of the celA enzyme from Clostridium thermocellum NCIB 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from Cellulomonas uda CB4. However, the Endo-K protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from Bacillus that had been previously characterized. These results indicate that the gene for Endo-K in Bacillus sp. KSM-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other Bacillus endoglucanases.
TI  - Characterization of rabbit ileal receptors for Clostridium difficile toxin A. Evidence for a receptor-coupled G protein.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the surface receptor for toxin A, the enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, on rabbit intestinal brush borders (BB) and on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Purified toxin A was radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G protein.
TI  - Clostridium orbiscindens sp. nov., a human intestinal bacterium capable of cleaving the flavonoid C-ring.
AB  - Clostridium orbiscindens sp. nov. is an obligate anaerobe that is capable of cleaving the C-3-C-4 bond of the natural anticarcinogen quercetin. The metabolic products, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and presumably phlorglucinol, are not known to possess anticarcinogen properties. This organism was isolated from human feces. On sheep blood agar plates C. orbiscindens forms minute, irregular, convex, gray or white, shiny, smooth, nonhemolytic colonies. It is beta-hemolytic on rabbit blood agar. The motile peritrichous rods are gram variable. Subpolar spores are common. Cultures are resistant to 80 degrees C for 10 min. Capsules are absent. This asaccharolytic organism does not metabolize esculin, urea, meat, gelatin, casein, or nitrate. The G + C content is 56 to 57 mol%. DNA hybridization experiments did not reveal relatedness to phenotypically similar Clostridium strains. Strain 265 (= ATCC 49531) is the type strain.
TI  - Ethanol and amylase production by a newly isolated Clostridium sp.
AB  - A newly isolated, anaerobic, mesophillic bacterium, Clostridium sp. strain YK-3,  ferments pentoses, hexoses, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, such as soluble starch and glycogen, to ethanol and acetate. The potential of this strain for ethanol and amylase production has been examined. Ethanol was the major product and acetate a minor one. The organism could grow with soluble starch in the presence of 40 g ethanol/l. Extracellular alpha-amylase activity was detected when the strain was cultivated with soluble starch, glycogen or dextrin. The optimum pH of this amylase was 5.5 to 7.5 with an optimum temperature of 50 degrees C.
TI  - Reduction of nitroaromatic compounds by anaerobic bacteria isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Human intestinal microbial flora were screened for their abilities to reduce nitroaromatic compounds by growing them on brain heart infusion agar plates containing 1-nitropyrene. Bacteria metabolizing 1-nitropyrene, detected by the appearance of clear zones around the colonies, were identified as Clostridium leptum, Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium clostridiiforme, another Clostridium sp., and a Eubacterium sp. These bacteria produced aromatic amines from nitroaromatic compounds, as shown by thin-layer chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and biochemical tests. Incubation of three of these bacteria with 1-nitropyrene, 1,3-dinitropyrene, and 1,6-dinitropyrene inactivated the direct-acting mutagenicity associated with these compounds. Menadione and o-iodosobenzoic acid inhibited nitroreductase activity in all of the isolates, indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the active site of the enzyme. The optimum pH for nitroreductase activity was 8.0. Only the Clostridium sp. required added flavin adenine dinucleotide for nitroreductase activity. The nitroreductases were constitutive and extracellular. An activity stain for the detection of nitroreductase on anaerobic native polyacrylamide gels was developed. This activity stain revealed only one isozyme in each bacterium but showed that the nitroreductases from different bacteria had distinct electrophoretic mobilities.
TI  - Two cellulolytic Clostridium species: Clostridium cellulosi sp. nov. and Clostridium cellulofermentans sp. nov.
AB  - Two cellulolytic clostridia, one thermophilic and the other mesophilic, were isolated and characterized. Cells of the thermophile are gram-negative rods that are motile with lophotrichous flagella and spherical terminal endospores which swell the cells. The optimum growth temperature is 55 to 60 degrees C, with a range of 40 to 65 degrees C. The deoxyribonucleic acid composition is 35 mol% G + C. The name Clostridium cellulosi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AS 1.1777. Cells of the mesophile are gram negative and motile with peritrichous flagella and terminal oval or spherical spores which swell the cells. The deoxyribonucleic acid composition is 34 mol% G + C. The name Clostridium cellulofermentans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AS 1.1775. Both C. cellulosi AS 1.1777 and C. cellulofermentans AS 1.1775 are deposited in the China Committee for Culture Collection of Microorganisms, Institute of Microbiology, Academia Sinica, Beijing, People's Republic of China.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1.
AB  - Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Fermentation of Inulin by Clostridium thermosuccinogenes sp. nov., a Thermophilic Anaerobic Bacterium Isolated from Various Habitats.
AB  - Four closely related strains of thermophilic bacteria were isolated via enrichment in batch and continuous culture with inulin as the sole source of carbon and energy by using inoculations from various sources. These new strains were isolated from beet pulp from a sugar refinery, soil around a Jerusalem artichoke, fresh cow manure, and mud from a tropical pond in a botanical garden. The cells of this novel species of strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were rod shaped and nonmotile. Growth on inulin was possible between 40 and 65 degrees C, with optimum growth at 58 degrees C. All strains were capable of fermenting a large number of sugars. Formate, acetate, ethanol, lactate, H(2), and succinate were the main organic fermentation products after growth on fructose, glucose, or inulin. Synthesis of inulinase in batch culture closely paralleled growth, and the enzyme was almost completely cell bound. Strain IC is described as the type strain of a new species, Clostridium thermosuccinogenes sp. nov., with a G+C content of 35.9 mol%.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of celC307 encoding endoglucanase C307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1.
AB  - The celC gene, encoding endoglucanase C, of Clostridium thermocellum was recently sequenced while a promoter region was not identified. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of celC307 of Clostridium sp. strain F1 was identified and compared with that of the C. thermocellum gene. The open reading frame was composed of 1029 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a protein of a molecular weight of 40,905. We identified promoter sequences (TGGACA and TATAAT) at a position about 150 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. Six substitutions were found in the coding region, 3 leading to amino acid replacements. Five substitutions and 1 deletion of a nucleotide were found in the region upstream of the initiation codon, 1 present at the promoter sequence. Overproduction of endoglucanase C307 (EGC307) in Escherichia coli strongly inhibited the cell growth of the host strain. Around 50% of EGC307 produced in E. coli was detected in the periplasmic fraction. The N-terminal amino acid sequence suggested that this protein was exported into the periplasm without processing of a signal peptide.
TI  - Value of Clostridium difficile antigen test in immunocompromised hosts in the tropics.
AB  - 39 fecal and body fluid specimens of immunocompromised patients who developed diarrhoea were tested for Clostridium difficile antigen test. The test was identified in only 11 and in one ascitic fluid. Endoscopy was performed in 5 patients and it showed pseudomembranous colitis in one. Numerous antibiotics were associated with C. difficile related diarrhea: ampicillin, 43%; cephalosporins, 43% and clindamycin, 14%. Three Salmonella sp., and one Entamoeba histolytica were detected among patients who later developed C. difficile associated diarrhea. The effect of oral vancomycin and fusidic acid was demonstrated in patients with C. difficile related diarrhea or colitis. The C. difficile antigen test is promising diagnostic tool in immunocompromised hosts in the tropics where both Salmonella and E. histolytica all are endemic.
TI  - Isolation of Clostridium propionicum strain 19acry3 and further characteristics of the species.
AB  - Two mixed cultures able to ferment acrylate to equimolar acetate and propionate were enriched from anaerobic sediments. From one of these mixed cultures a pure culture of a Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic bacterium was isolated. This strain, designated 19acry3 (= DSM 6251) was identified as belonging to the species Clostridium propionicum. Only a narrow range of organic compounds supported growth, including acrylate and lactate. Acrylate and lactate were fermented to acetate and propionate in a 1:2 molar ratio. When co-cultured with the non-acrylate-fermenting "Campylobacter" sp. strain 19gly1 (DSM 6222), the fermentation balance shifted to almost equimolar acetate and propionate. Strain 19acry3 was compared with Clostridium propionicum type strain X2 (DSM 1682). The two strains displayed similar phenotypic properties. The mol% G + C of DNA isolated from both strains was 36-37 (by thermal denaturation). Both strains displayed a characteristic fluorescence when observed by fluorescence microscopy. Cell-free extracts of both strains were examined by spectrophotofluorimetry. In both strains, two excitation peaks were observed at 378 and 470 nm. Excitation at either of these wavelengths resulted in an emission maximum at 511 nm.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Characterization of the extracellular cellulase from a mesophilic clostridium (strain C7).
AB  - An extracellular, 700,000-Mr multiprotein complex that catalyzed the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose (Avicel) was isolated from cultures of Clostridium sp. strain C7, a mesophile from freshwater sediment. In addition to cellulose (Avicel, ball-milled filter paper), the multiprotein complex hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose, cellodextrins, xylan, and xylooligosaccharides. Hydrolysis of cellulose or cellotetraose by the complex yielded cellobiose as the main product. Cellopentaose or cellohexaose was hydrolyzed by the complex to cellotriose or cellotetraose, respectively, in addition to cellobiose. Xylobiose was the main product of xylan hydrolysis, and xylobiose and xylotriose were the major products of xylooligosaccharide hydrolysis. Activity (Avicelase) resulting in hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose required Ca2+ and a reducing agent. The multiprotein complex had temperature optima for Avicelase, carboxymethylcellulase, and xylanase activities at 45, 55, and 55 degrees C, respectively, and pH optima at 5.6 to 5.8, 5.5, and 6.55, respectively. Electron microscopy of the 700,000-Mr enzyme complex revealed particles relatively uniform in size (12 to 15 nm wide) and apparently composed of subunit structures. Elution of strain C7 concentrated culture fluid from Sephacryl S-300 columns yielded an A280 peak in the 130,000-Mr region. Pooled fractions from the 130,000-Mr peak had carboxymethylcellulase activity but lacked Avicelase activity. Except for the inability to hydrolyze cellulose, the 130,000-Mr preparation had a substrate specificity identical to that of the 700,000-Mr protein complex. A comparison by immunoblotting techniques of proteins in the 130,000- and 700,000-Mr preparations, indicated that the two enzyme preparations had cross-reacting antigenic determinants.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding the adenosylcobalamin-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin-dependent conversion of certain vicinal amino alcohols to oxo compounds and ammonia. Studies of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase from Clostridium sp. and Escherichia coli have suggested that the enzyme is a heterodimer composed of subunits of Mr approximately 55,000 and 35,000. Using a partial Sau3A Salmonella typhimurium library ligated into pBR328 and selecting by complementation of a mutant lacking ethanolamine ammonia-lyase activity, we have cloned the genes for the 2 subunits of the S. typhimurium enzyme. The genes were localized to a 6.5-kilobase fragment of S. typhimurium DNA, from which they could be expressed in E. coli under noninducing conditions. Sequencing of a 2526-base pair portion of this 6.5-kilobase DNA fragment revealed two open reading frames separated by 21 base pairs. The open reading frames encoded proteins of 452 and 286 residues whose derived N-terminal sequences were identical to the N-terminal sequences of the 2 subunits of the E. coli ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, except that residue 16 of the large subunit was asparagine in the E. coli sequence and aspartic acid in the S. typhimurium sequence.
TI  - Clostridium aldrichii sp. nov., a cellulolytic mesophile inhabiting a wood-fermenting anaerobic digester.
AB  - An anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming, cellulolytic bacterium was repeatedly isolated from a wood-fermenting anaerobic digester. Cells of this organism were gram-positive rods, motile with a bundle of polar flagella, and formed subterminal oblong spores. The colonies in agar had an irregular shape with many platelike structures and were greyish white. Cellulose, xylan, and cellobiose served as substrates for growth. Acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, lactate, succinate, H2, and CO2 were products of cellobiose fermentation. The optimal temperature and pH for growth were 35 degrees C and 7, respectively. The DNA composition was 40 mol% G + C. The name Clostridium aldrichii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is P-1 (= OGI 112, = ATCC 49358).
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Azoreductase activity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora.
AB  - A plate assay was developed for the detection of anaerobic bacteria that produce  azoreductases. With this plate assay, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes were isolated from human feces and identified as Eubacterium hadrum (2 strains), Eubacterium spp. (2 species), Clostridium clostridiiforme, a Butyrivibrio sp., a Bacteroides sp., Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium nexile, and a Clostridium sp. The average rate of reduction of Direct Blue 15 dye (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in these strains ranged from 16 to 135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. The enzymes were inactivated by oxygen. In seven isolates, a flavin compound (riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or flavin mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. In the other three isolates and in Clostridium perfringens, no added flavin was required for activity. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each bacterium expressed only one azoreductase isozyme. At least three types of azoreductase enzyme were produced by the different isolates. All of the azoreductases were produced constitutively and released extracellularly.
TI  - A54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  - A54145 complex is made up of eight factors; A, A1, B, B1, C, D, E, and F which were active in vitro (MIC 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against Gram-positive aerobic organisms. The complex, factor B and B1 were found to be active against two strains of Clostridium perfringens. A calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. Resistance build-up was seen when Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of A54145 antibiotics. This resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. Factor A was very effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ED50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). Factor B was more active against S. pyogenes in vivo (sc ED50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). Acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. Semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of the chitinolytic properties of Clostridium sp. strain 9.1 and a chitin-degrading bacterium from the intestinal tract of the plaice, Pleuronectes platessa (L.).
AB  - The chitinolytic properties of a facultatively anaerobic bacterium isolated from  the hindgut of plaice were compared with those of Clostridium sp. strain 9.1, a bacterium isolated from anoxic estuarine sediment. The chitinolytic enzyme systems of the gut isolate and strain 9.1 both released N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (NAG2) as the major hydrolysis end-product. During the hydrolysis of chitin, there was transient accumulation of a non-sedimentary chitin fraction which was not detectable by high-performance liquid chromatography. Growth on NAG2 repressed chitinase synthesis in the gut isolate but not in the Clostridium species. Thiol reagents were strongly inhibitory to the chitinase of the strict anaerobe but did not affect the hydrolytic enzymes of the gut isolate. When the two bacteria were cocultured with chitin as the sole carbon and energy source, Clostridium sp. strain 9.1 was always outcompeted. Experiments with batch and phauxostat cultures showed that the competitiveness of strain 9.1 could be improved dramatically by the inclusion in the cocultures of a non-chitinolytic bacterium capable of fermenting chitin oligomers. The cooperation between the oligomer-fermenting species and the Clostridium sp. is discussed in relation to the regulation of chitinolytic activity in the latter organism.
TI  - [Mutants with high butanol production from a strain of solventogenic Clostridium  isolated from olive black-water].
AB  - Butanol high producing mutants of a solventogenic Clostridium sp. capable of degrading olive black water, were selected according to ethanol or butanol resistance after treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Mutants were quickly screened from isolated colonies and then characterized in standard culture conditions.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes from the thermophile "Caldocellum saccharolyticum".
AB  - A lambda recombinant bacteriophage coding for xylanase and beta-xylosidase activity has been isolated from a genomic library of the extremely thermophilic anaerobe "Caldocellum saccharolyticum." Partial Sau3AI fragments of the lambda recombinant DNA were ligated into pBR322. A recombinant plasmid with an insertion of ca. 7 kilobases of thermophilic DNA expressing both enzymatic activities was isolated. The location of the genes has been established by analyzing deletion derivatives, and the DNA sequence of 6.067 kilobases of the insert has been determined. Five open reading frames (ORFs) were found, one of which (ORF1; Mr 40,455) appears to code for a xylanase (XynA) which also acts on o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside. Another, ORF5 (Mr 56,365), codes for a beta-xylosidase (XynB). The xynA gene product shows significant homology with the xylanases from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C125 and Clostridium thermocellum.
TI  - Digestive tract microflora liberates low molecular weight peptides with immunotriggering activity.
AB  - Antibiotic digestive tract decontamination in BALB/c-mice resulted in a significant reduction of peritoneal macrophage function and lymphocyte proliferation. Considerable evidence has accumulated showing that certain species of the indigenous gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microflora, e.g. Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Propionibacterium sp., liberate low molecular weight peptides which are able to trigger basic immune responses. Eradication of the GI-tract microflora apparently results in a lack of peptide production correlating to immunosuppression in experimental BALB/c-mice. Substitution of peptides in GI-tract decontaminated mice reconstituted macrophage function as well as proliferation of lymphatic tissue.
TI  - Controlled potential enzymology of methyl transfer reactions involved in acetyl-CoA synthesis by CO dehydrogenase and the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum.
AB  - Many anaerobic bacteria fix CO2 via the Wood pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), also called acetyl-CoA synthase, accepts the methyl group from the methylated corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP), binds a carbonyl group from CO, CO2, or the carboxyl of pyruvate, and binds coenzyme A. Then CODH catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from these enzyme-bound groups. Here, we have characterized the methyl transfer steps involved in acetyl-CoA synthesis. We have studied the reactions leading to methylation of CODH by methyl iodide and shown an absolute requirement of the C/Fe-SP in this reaction. In addition, we have discovered and partly characterized two previously unknown exchange reactions catalyzed by CODH: between the methylated C/Fe-SP and methylated CODH and between methylated CODH and the methyl moiety of acetyl-CoA. We have performed these two exchange reactions, methylation of the C/Fe-SP, and methylation of CODH at controlled potentials. The rates of all these reactions except the exchange between methylated C/Fe-SP and methylated CODH are accelerated (from 1 to 2 orders of magnitude) when run at low potentials. Our results provide strong evidence for a nucleophilic redox-active metal center on CODH as the initial acceptor of the methyl group from the methylated C/Fe-SP. This metal center also is proposed to be involved in the cleavage of acetyl-CoA in the reverse reaction.
TI  - The isolation and properties of collagenolytic proteases from crab hepatopancreas.
AB  - A mixture of collagenolytic proteases has been isolated from the Kamchatka crab hepatopancreas. The four individual enzymes were further separated with FPLC and partially characterized. Crab collagenolytic proteases possess a high activity against different types of collagen, especially against calf skin collagen Type III and bovine lens capsule collagen Type IV, which is resistant to the microbial Clostridium sp. collagenases. In contrast with microbial collagenases the crab enzymes are good general proteases, able to cleave standard synthetic and protein substrates and possess a chymotrypsin-, trypsin- and elastase-like specificity. N-Terminal sequence analysis revealed that crab collagenolytic proteases had evolved from a trypsin-like ancestor. Crab proteases, structurally belonging to the trypsin-like enzymes, nevertheless, possess the unique ability, among this class of enzymes, to cleave the native insoluble collagen. It seems that crab collagenolytic proteases and true metalloenzyme vertebrate and microbial collagenases have certain common structural features particularly in the regions of their substrate binding site.
TI  - [Effect of rokitamycin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. A dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. In changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. Cases from which Citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. Among Gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of Pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., Gram-positive cocci did not show particular patterns of changes. No changes in mean count of total anaerobes were observed during the course of the experiment. Among individual anaerobes, numbers of Lactobacillus and Peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. Clostridium difficile D-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. The drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1 cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. The mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. The reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the oral cavity, fangs and venom of Bothrops jararaca: possible source of infection at the site of bite].
AB  - Culture of fang, fang sheath and venom of fifteen healthy freshly captured Bothrops jararaca were analyzed. The bacteria most frequently encountered were group D streptococci (12 snakes), Enterobacter sp. (6), Providencia rettgeri (6), Providencia sp. (4), Escherichia coli (4), Morganella morganii (3) and Clostridium sp. (5). The bacteria observed are similar to those found in the abscesses from Bothrops bitten patients. Since these snake mouth bacteria may be inoculated during the snake bite, bacterial multiplication and infection may occur under favorable conditions.
TI  - Clostridium homopropionicum sp. nov., a new strict anaerobe growing with 2-, 3-,  or 4-hydroxybutyrate.
AB  - From anoxic sewage sludge a new strictly anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium was isolated with 2-hydroxybutyrate as sole substrate. 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-chlorobutyrate, crotonate, vinylacetate, and pyruvate were fermented to acetate and butyrate. Fructose was converted to acetate, butyrate, butanol, and H2. Lactate and acrylate were fermented to acetate and propionate. Cells pregrown with lactate fermented 2-hydroxybutyrate to butyrate, propionate and acetate. No inorganic electron acceptors were reduced. The DNA base ratio was 32.0 +/- 1.0 mol% and was similar to that of Clostridium propionicum, which was determined to be 35.3 +/- 0.5 mol%. Strain LuHBu1 is described as type strain of a new species, Clostridium homopropionicum sp. nov. Another isolate obtained from marine sediment degraded 2- and 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetate and butyrate and was in some respects similar to the known species Ilyobacter polytropus.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Apparition of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  - Anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. Nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. Numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. The purpose of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides with the colonization by C. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. The intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. C. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. C. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp.
TI  - Quantification of the potencies of EDRF-releasers from isolated rabbit aortic strips.
AB  - We have compared several known releasers of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)(13) in respect to their potencies to generate EDRF by endothelium of rabbit aortic strips (RbA) superfused with Krebs' buffer. The vasorelaxation by EDRF which is equivalent to 10 pmoles of GTN was evoked by 0.7 pmoles of substance P(SP), 50 pmoles of acetylcholine (Ach), 521 pmoles of calcium ionophore A 23187, 2720 pmoles of ADP. Threshold potencies of these agonists are inversely proportional to the maximum amount of EDRF released. Phospholipase C (PLC) from Clostridium perfringens at a dose of 0.1 U caused the relaxation of a similar magnitude. Phospholipase A2 (1 U), thrombin (1 U), bradykinin (30 nmoles) and serotonin (10 pmoles) did not release EDRF. It is concluded that endothelial cells of RbA differ from endothelial cells of other species in their susceptibility to release EDRF in response to various agonists.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Spectroelectrochemical studies of the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein involved in acetyl coenzyme A synthesis by Clostridium thermoaceticum.
AB  - An 88-kDa corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) is the methyl carrier protein in the acetyl-CoA pathway of Clostridium thermoaceticum. In previous studies, it was found that this C/Fe-SP contains (5-methoxybenzimidazolyl)cobamide and a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ center, both of which undergo redox cycling during catalysis, and that the benzimidazole base is uncoordinated to the cobalt (base off) in all three redox states, 3+, 2+, and 1+ [Ragsdale, S.W., Lindahl, P.A., & Munck, E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14289-14297]. In this paper, we have determined the midpoint reduction potentials for the metal centers in this C/Fe-SP by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-visible spectroelectrochemical methods. The midpoint reduction potentials for the Co3+/2+ and the Co2+/1 couples of the corrinoid were found to be 300-350 and -504 mV (+/- 3 mV) in Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, respectively. We also removed the (5-methoxybenzimidazolyl)cobamide cofactor from the C/Fe-SP and determined that its Co3+/2+ reduction potential is 207 mV at pH 7.6. The midpoint potential for the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ couple in the C/Fe-SP was determined to be -523 mV (+/- 5 mV). Removal of this cluster totally inactivates the protein; however, there is little effect of cluster removal on the midpoint potential of the Co2+/1+ couple. In addition, removal of the cobamide has an insignificant effect on the midpoint reduction potential of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. A 27-kDa corrinoid protein (CP) also was studied since it contains (5-methoxybenzimidazolyl)cobamide in the base-on form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Accuracy and reproducibility of the 4-hour ATB 32A method for anaerobe identification.
AB  - The ATB 32A system (API System SA, La Balme les Grottes, Montalieu-Vercieu, France) was evaluated for use in the identification of 214 anaerobes. Organisms included 73 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 24 Bacteroides spp., 10 fusobacteria, 43 clostridia, 28 cocci, and 36 gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. With the concomitant use of Gram stain, pigmentation, catalase testing, and aerobic growth, the ATB 32A system correctly identified 97% of the B. fragilis group isolates, 88% of Bacteroides spp., 50% of fusobacteria, 74% of clostridia, 100% of cocci, and 86% of the gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Overall, 188 strains (88%) were correctly identified, with 18 (8%) requiring extra tests, other than the four mentioned above, for correct identification. Eight strains were misidentified, including one Bacteroides sp., three fusobacteria, one Clostridium sp., and three gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Reproducibility was very good, with 12 of 14 strains (86%) tested in triplicate yielding identical correct results on each of three occasions and 2 strains (14%) yielding identical correct results on two occasions. There was a low-probability identification (including the correct species) on the third testing. The ATB 32A system represents a worthwhile advance in systems used for the identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [The incidence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus and Clostridium perfringens from cases of diarrhea in children, in the region of Campinas, SP, Brazil].
AB  - A survey for the detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus  and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in diarrheic stools of children up to 2 years old was carried out in the region of Campinas, SP, Brazil. Twenty-seven (20.45%) faecal specimens were positive for ETEC. From these samples 41 strains of ETEC were isolated from which 40 produced only thermolabile (LT) enterotoxin, as detected by a modified radial immune haemolysis test. Among the 183 faecal specimens examined for the detection of rotavirus, 29 (15.84%) were positive when examined by polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoenzymatic assay (EIA) being 15 (51.7%), derived from stools collected from winter months. All strains of rotavirus belonged to group A and through the PAGE technique, it was observed that the most frequent (9 strains) electrophoretype, according to the adopted classification, was Ib, IIc, IIIb, IVa. Only 113 fecal specimens were examined for the presence of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens. For the detection of enterotoxin in culture supernatants the reverse passive haemagglutination and intravenous inoculation of mice were used. Twelve (10.61%) enterotoxigenic C. perfringens strains were found. Taking into consideration these findings the authors call the attention of the relative value of conventional coprocultures for diagnostic purposes, pointing out the important of establishing simplified methods which would render easier, the detection and identification of the groups of enteropathogenic agents studied in this research.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of biliary tract disease.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of the experiences of two military hospitals over 4 years in the recovery of organisms from biliary tract specimens was done. Bacterial growth was obtained in 123 bile specimens. Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were present in 59 specimens (48%), aerobic bacteria only were present in 4 specimens (3%), and mixed anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 60 specimens (49%). Of 286 isolates recovered, 216 were aerobic or facultative (1.8 per specimen) and 70 were anaerobic (0.6 per specimen). The predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (71 isolates), group D streptococci (42 isolates), Klebsiella sp. (29 isolates), Clostridium sp. (27 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (28 isolates), and Enterobacter sp. (16 isolates). Polymicrobial infections were present in 108 instances (88%). A higher recovery rate of anaerobes was present in patients with chronic infections than in those with acute infections and did not correlate with the presence of gallstones or use of antimicrobial prophylaxis.
TI  - Bioelectrical conversion in sensors with living cells.
AB  - Bacterial metabolism can drive various processes with biotechnological significance, like in the case of biosensors for probing organic compounds, or in biofuel cells. Here we present some of our results connected with the construction of a bacterial electrode with Pseudomonas sp. for probing glucose in body fluids, and those related to biofuel cells with anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium sp.). The output of the bioselective electrode linearly indicates glucose concentrations in the 2.5 x 10(-5)-1.25 x 10(-4) M domain, with a sensitivity limit of 10(-5) M. The time constant is 10 min, and it works for more than ten days. The amperometric response of biofuel cells with Clostridium sp. offers the electrical image of the state of the bacterial culture itself, thus being a promising tool for the automated control of the bacterial suspensions used in fermentative reactors.
TI  - Cellulase families revealed by hydrophobic cluster analysis.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of 21 beta-glycanases have been compared by hydrophobic  cluster analysis. Six families of cellulases have been identified on the basis of primary structure homology: (A) endoglucanases B, C and E of Clostridium thermocellum; endoglucanases of Erwinia chrysanthemi and Bacillus sp.; endoglucanase III of Trichoderma reesei; endoglucanase I of Schizophyllum commune; (B) cellobiohydrolase II of T. reesei; endoglucanases of Cellulomonas fimi and Streptomyces sp; (C) cellobiohydrolases I of T. reesei and of Phanerochaete chrysosporium; endoglucanase I of T. reesei; (D) endoglucanase A of C. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from Ce. uda; (E) endoglucanase D of C. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from Pseudomonas fluorescens; (F) xylanases of C. thermocellum and of Cryptococcus albidus and the cellobio-hydrolase of Ce. fimi. For each family, conserved potentially catalytic residues have have been listed and previous allocations of the active-site residues are evaluated in the light of the alignment of the amino acid sequences. A strong homology is also reported for the putative cellulose-binding domains of cellulases of Ce. fimi and of P. fluorescens.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - Mechanism of intestinal formation of deoxycholic acid from cholic acid in humans: evidence for a 3-oxo-delta 4-steroid intermediate.
AB  - 12 alpha-Hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid coupled to an adenosine nucleotide has been shown to be a metabolite of cholic acid in the intestinal anaerobic bacteria, Eubacterium species VPI 12708 (1987. J. Biol. Chem. 262: 4701-4707) and it has been suggested that this may be an intermediate in the conversion of cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. The possibility that the intestinal conversion of cholic acid into deoxycholic acid involves a 3-oxo-delta 4-steroid as an intermediate has been studied in the present work by use of [3 beta-3H]- and [5-3H]-labeled cholic acid. Whole cells as well as cell extracts of Eubacterium sp. VPI 12708 catalyzed conversion of [3 beta-3H] + [24-14C]cholic acid into deoxycholic acid with loss of about 50% of 3H label. When unlabeled chenodeoxycholic acid (20 microM) was added along with [3 beta-3] + [24-14C]cholic acid, then approximately 85% of the [3 beta-3H]-labeled was lost from deoxycholic acid. After administration of the same mixture to two healthy volunteers, deoxycholic acid could be isolated that had lost 81 and 84%, respectively, of the 3H label. Conversion of a mixture of [5-3H]- and [24-14C]labeled cholic acid by the above intestinal bacteria or cell extracts led to loss of 79-94 of the [5-3H] label.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  - Six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in sterile saline (five patients). The mixture led to a prompt loss of Cl difficile and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by Bacteroides sp, which had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. Strains of Escherichia coli, Cl bifermentans, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of Cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The finding that Bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was present after recovery suggests that the absence of Bacteroides sp may result in chronic relapsing Cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by Cl difficile.
TI  - Kinetics of biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloroethane by Clostridium sp. strain  TCAIIB.
AB  - Batch experiments were conducted to examine the effects of high concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) on the biotransformation of TCA by Clostridium sp. strain TCAIIB. The biotic dehalogenation of TCA to 1,1-dichloroethane by nongrowing cells was measured at 35 degrees C, and the data were used to obtain the kinetic parameters of the Monod relationship half-velocity coefficient Ks (31 microM) and the coefficient of maximum rate of TCA biotransformation (kTCA; 0.28 mumol per mg per day). The yield of biomass decreased with an increase in the TCA concentration, although TCA concentrations up to 750 microM did not completely inhibit bacterial growth. Also, kTCA was higher in the presence of high concentrations of TCA. A mathematical model based on a modified Monod equation was used to describe the biotransformation of TCA. The abiotic transformation of TCA to 1,1-dichloroethene was measured at 35 degrees C, and the first-order formation rate coefficient for 1,1-dichloroethene (ke) was determined to be 0.86 per year.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane by a Clostridium sp.
AB  - A gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, motile, endospore-forming rod, tentatively identified as a proteolytic Clostridium sp., was isolated from the effluent of an anaerobic suspended-growth bioreactor. The organism was able to biotransform 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was completely transformed (greater than or equal to 99.5%) by reductive dehalogenation to 1,1-dichloroethane (30 to 40%) and, presumably by other mechanisms, to acetic acid (7%) and unidentified products. The reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloromethane led to the intermediate trichloromethane, which was further transformed to dichloromethane (8%) and unidentified products. The biotransformation occurred during the exponential growth phase, as well as during the stationary phase. Tetrachlorethene, trichloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethene, chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, and dichloromethane were not biotransformed significantly by the organism.
TI  - NADP-dependent 3 beta-, 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities from a lecithinase-lipase-negative Clostridium species 25.11.c.
AB  - A lecithinase-lipase-negative Clostridium sp. 25.11.c., not fitting in any of the species of Clostridia described so far as judged by morphological, physiological, and biochemical data, was shown to contain NADP-dependent 3 beta-, 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The three hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases could be demonstrated in the supernatant and in the membrane fraction after solubilization with Triton X-100, suggesting enzymes which were originally membrane bound. The 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was synthesized constitutively, and the specific enzyme activity was significantly reduced by growth medium supplementation with 3-keto bile acids and trisubstituted bile acids. A pH optimum of 7.5 and a molecular weight of approx. 104,000 were estimated by molecular sieve chromatography. The enzyme reduced the 3-keto group of bile acids; an oxidation of a 3 beta-hydroxyl function could not be demonstrated. The lowest Km values were found for disubstituted bile acids, trisubstituted and conjugated bile acids having higher Km values. 7 alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, but not 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, was already present in uninduced cells. The specific activities, however, were greatly enhanced when cells were grown in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid or 3 alpha-hydroxy-7-keto-5 beta-cholanoic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid with its 7 beta-hydroxyl group was ineffective as an inducer. Molecular weights of approx. 82,000 and 115,000 were found for the 7 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and the 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, respectively. In contrast to the in vivo situation, the reaction could only be demonstrated in the reductive direction in vitro. Here, the pH optimum for the overall reaction was 8.5-8.7. 3 beta-, 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were readily demonstrated for at least 48 h when preparations were stored at 4 degrees C, but were found to be heat-sensitive.
TI  - Clostridium methylpentosum sp. nov.: a ring-shaped intestinal bacterium that ferments only methylpentoses and pentoses.
AB  - An intestinal bacterium isolated from a human subject utilized only two methylpentoses (L-rhamnose and L-fucose) and two pentoses (L-lyxose and D-arabinose) as fermentable substrates, among many compounds tested. The isolate was obligately anaerobic and had a distinctive morphology, its cells being rods bent in the shape of rings with the ends slightly overlapping. Single ring-shaped cells and left-handed helical chains of cells were present in cultures. The cells were surrounded by large capsules which appeared as thick, fibrous masses when examined by electron microscopy. Capsules were formed by cells growing in media containing any one of the four fermentable substrates. Terminally located, heat-resistant endospores were formed on plates of an enriched agar medium supplemented with L-rhamnose. End products of L-rhamnose or L-fucose fermentation included acetate, propionate, n-propanol, CO2, and H2. The isolate represented a new species of Clostridium for which the name Clostridium methylpentosum (type strain R2, ATCC 43829) is proposed. This organism may participate in intestinal digestive processes by metabolizing rhamnose released via the enzymatic depolymerization of dietary pectin.
TI  - Some factors affecting isolation of Clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  - Clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (CI)]: Human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog, 2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). Quantification of C. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. Contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., C. perfringens and Streptococcus sp., Group G, inhibited isolation of C. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Topological distribution of choline phospholipid fatty acids in trout intestinal  brush-border membrane.
AB  - The transbilayer distribution of choline phospholipids in trout intestinal brush-border membrane has been investigated using phospholipase C (from Clostridium welchii). In the middle intestine, 84% of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 60% of sphingomyelin (SP) are located in the outer membrane leaflet. In the posterior intestine, 89% of PC and 52% of SP are located in the outer membrane leaflet. The externally located PC molecular species are (n - 3) fatty acid-rich in both parts of the intestine. While the sphingomyelin molecular species containing 24:1(n - 9) are exclusively located in the outer leaflet in the middle intestine, those containing 14:0 are more abundant in the same leaflet but in the posterior intestine. This strongly asymmetric distribution of both choline phospholipids may have numerous consequences on the brush-border membrane characteristics.
TI  - l-Methionine, a Precursor of Trace Methane in Some Proteolytic Clostridia.
AB  - The in vivo formation of methane and of several S-methyl volatile compounds from  the terminal S-methyl group of l-methionine is reported for growing cultures of four Clostridium strains (C. hastiforme, C. histolyticum, C. subterminale, and Clostridium sp. strain DSM 1786). After growth in 5 ml of unamended medium, C. hastiforme formed the highest amount of methane (408 nmol per tube in the headspace). When the culture medium was amended with 100 mM l-[S-methyl-H(3)]methionine, the four strains formed [H(3)]methane (proportion in the methane peak, >85%) as well as methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and S-methyl thioacetate labeled on the methyl moiety. Methanethiol is also a precursor of methane for Clostridium sp. strain DSM 1786. The trace methane formation observed for these four proteolytic, nonglucidolytic Clostridium strains can be of ecological interest, particularly in aquatic sediments and in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. It can explain in part the trace methane formation which cannot be ascribed to methanogens sensu stricto.
TI  - Enumeration and isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria from human feces.
AB  - The fibrolytic microbiota of the human large intestine was examined to determine  the numbers and types of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria present. Fecal samples from each of five individuals contained bacteria capable of degrading the hydrated cellulose in spinach and in wheat straw pretreated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP-WS), whereas degradation of the relatively crystalline cellulose in Whatman no. 1 filter paper (PMC) was detected for only one of the five samples. The mean concentration of cellulolytic bacteria, estimated with AHP-WS as a substrate, was 1.2 X 10(8)/ml of feces. Pure cultures of bacteria isolated on AHP-WS were able to degrade PMC, indicating that interactions with other microbes were primarily responsible for previous low success rates in detecting fecal cellulolytic bacteria with PMC as a substrate. The cellulolytic bacteria included Ruminococcus spp., Clostridium sp., and two unidentified strains. The mean concentration of hemicellulolytic bacteria, estimated with larchwood xylan as a substrate, was 1.8 X 10(10)/ml of feces. The hemicellulose-degrading bacteria included Butyrivibrio sp., Clostridium sp., Bacteroides sp., and two unidentified strains, as well as four of the five cellulolytic strains. This work demonstrates that many humans harbor intestinal cellulolytic bacteria and that a hydrated cellulose source such as AHP-WS is necessary for their consistent detection and isolation.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Anaerobic microbial dissolution of transition and heavy metal oxides.
AB  - Anaerobic microbial dissolution of several crystalline, water-insoluble forms of  metal oxides commonly associated with the waste from energy production was investigated. An anaerobic N-fixing Clostridium sp. with an acetic, butyric, and lactic acid fermentation pattern, isolated from coal-cleaning waste, solubilized Fe(2)O(3) and MnO(2) by direct enzymatic reduction; CdO, CuO, PbO, and ZnO were solubilized by indirect action due to the production of metabolites and the lowering of the pH of the growth medium. Extracellular heat-labile components of the cell-free spent medium obtained from cultures without oxide solubilized a significant amount of Fe(2)O(3) (1.7 mumol); however, direct contact with the bacterial cells resulted in the complete dissolution (4.8 mumol) of the oxide. Under identical conditions, the cell-free spent medium solubilized only a small amount of MnO(2) (0.07 mumol), whereas 2.3 mumol of the oxide was solubilized by direct bacterial contact. Reduction of Fe(2)O(3) and MnO(2) by Clostridium sp. proceeds at different rates and, possibly, by different enzymatic systems. Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides appear to be used as sinks for excess electrons generated from glucose fermentation, since there is no apparent increase in growth of the bacterium concomitant with the reduction of the oxides. Dialysis bag experiments with Co(2)O(3) indicate that there is a slight dissolution of Co (0.16 mumol) followed by precipitation or biosorption. Although Mn(2)O(3), Ni(2)O(3), and PbO(2) may undergo reductive dissolution from a higher to a lower oxidation state, dissolution by direct or indirect action was not observed. Also, Cr(2)O(3) and NiO were not solubilized by direct or indirect action. Significant amounts of solubilized Cd, Cu, and Pb were immobilized by the bacterial biomass, and the addition of Cu inhibited the growth of the bacterium.
TI  - Purification of Clostridium botulinum type G progenitor toxin.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum type G cultured for 6 days at 30 degrees C in proteose peptone-yeast extract-glucose medium produced toxin of 1.3 x 10(4) LD50/ml. The toxin was precipitated at pH 4.0, extracted with 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and activated with trypsin. Sonic treatment and trypsinization of the residual precipitate released additional toxin, the toxicity of which corresponded to that detected in whole culture. Activated toxin obtained from the first extract and that from the residual precipitate were combined and purified by salting out, acid precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, chromatography on SP-Sephadex, and a second gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The yield of purified toxin from 10 liters of culture was 22.9 mg an 1.1 X 10(8) mouse ip LD50 with a specific toxicity of 3.0 X 10(7) mouse ip LD50/mg nitrogen. The molecular weight of the toxin was about 500,000, corresponding to that of L toxin of the other types. No M nor LL toxin was detected.
TI  - Comparative study of cefotetan and cefoxitin in the treatment of intra-abdominal  infections.
AB  - One hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. Most of the infections were community acquired, were associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. The clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group was 95%. Bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. Cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating Bacteroides fragilis and other species of Bacteroides, Clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). No clinically significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). Cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - The present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of Gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. The results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, MIC50 and MIC90. Of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. MIC90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, enterococci, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/L. Cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. All strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated in each species. The need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Establishment of specific pathogen-free rabbits by inoculation of hysterectomy-derived rabbits with fecal suspension and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Establishment of a specific pathogen-free (SPF) rabbit colony was attempted by transferring a total of 127 hysterectomy-derived rabbits directly into a barrier room where SPF rats had been reared. All rabbits except four died of mucoid enteritis-like diarrhea during 2 and 6 weeks of age. A second experiment consisted of four groups of hysterectomy-derived rabbits including: (1) noninoculated controls; (2) rabbits inoculated with suspension of feces from the survivors; (3) rabbits inoculated with a bacterial inoculum (Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium sp. isolated from conventional rabbits); and (4) rabbits inoculated with Streptococcus faecalis in addition to the inoculum used for group 3. All rabbits in group 1 died of diarrhea by 3 weeks of age. Survival rates of groups 2, 3 and 4 are 53%, 38% and 40%, respectively. On 7 days after the inoculation, Bacteroides was not recovered from fecal samples of group 1, but was recovered from many samples of the inoculated groups. Populations of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium in the samples in group 1 were larger than each of those in the inoculated groups. The present results suggest that the lethal diarrhea, after transferring hysterectomy-derived animals directly into a barrier room, can be controlled by inoculation with non-pathogenic anaerobes, especially Bacteroides.
TI  - Coloradocin, an antibiotic from a new Actinoplanes. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological properties.
AB  - Coloradocin was discovered in a screen for anti-anaerobe activity. The producing  organism was determined to be a new species of Actinoplanes, designated Actinoplanes coloradoensis sp. nov. Coloradocin inhibits Bacteroides, Clostridium and other anaerobes. It does not inhibit most aerobic bacteria but is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Coloradocin has low acute toxicity.
TI  - Production of a unique cytotoxin by Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. Because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that C. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by Shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157, or Clostridium difficile. Filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of C. jejuni were placed on HeLa cells (sensitive to Shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Of 12 isolates of C. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in HeLa and CHO cells (the CHO cells being insensitive to Shiga cytotoxin). One isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. The relative potency in HeLa cells was comparable to that of E. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of Shiga-like toxin. The other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin B, or supernatants of C. jejuni not treated with polymyxin B. Sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. The cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. Concentration of the C. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin B resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. The cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by Shiga toxin immune serum against either Shiga-like toxin I or II or by anti-Clostridium difficile antiserum. The C jejuni cytotoxin was partially labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees C. Cytotoxicity was retained in Scientific Products dialysis tubing D1615-1 (Mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). Some isolates of C. jejuni release a substance lethal to HeLa or CHO cells in vitro that is distinct from Shiga-like or Clostridium difficile toxin. This cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes C. jejuni enteritis.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial substance from a human Lactobacillus strain.
AB  - Lactobacillus sp. strain GG, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. It inhibited anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. The inhibitory activity occurred between pH 3 and 5 and was heat stable. Bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. The inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. It had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). Because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Bilateral abscessed orchiepididymitis associated with sepsis caused by Veillonella parvula and Clostridium perfringens: case report and review of the literature.
AB  - Veillonella species is a gram-negative coccus which is part of the anaerobic normal flora in the oral cavity, small intestine, upper respiratory tract, vagina, and urinary tract. The role that this organism plays in infection is not well known, and it is generally associated with other bacteria. We present a case of bilateral abscessed orchiepididymitis associated with septicemia due to Veillonella parvula and, later, to Clostridium perfringens, with the development of severe renal insufficiency and septic shock, which resolved favorably with antibiotic therapy, treatment of shock, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In reviewing the literature, we have not found any other case of sepsis due to Veillonella sp. associated with urological disorders.
TI  - Production of Thermostable alpha-Amylase, Pullulanase, and alpha-Glucosidase in Continuous Culture by a New Clostridium Isolate.
AB  - The production of alpha-amylase, pullulanase, and alpha-glucosidase and the formation of fermentation products by the newly isolated thermophilic Clostridium sp. strain EM1 were investigated in continuous culture with a defined medium and an incubation temperature of 60 degrees C. Enzyme production and excretion were greatly influenced by the dilution rate and the pH of the medium. The optimal values for the formation of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes were a pH of 5.9 and a dilution rate of 0.075 to 0.10 per h. Increase of the dilution rate from 0.1 to 0.3 per h caused a drastic drop in enzyme production. The ethanol concentration and optical density of the culture, however, remained almost constant. Growth limitation in the chemostat with 1% (wt/vol) starch was found optimal for enzyme production. Under these conditions 2,800 U of pullulanase per liter and 1,450 U of alpha-amylase per liter were produced; the amounts excreted were 70 and 55%, respectively.

TI  - Purification and properties of collagenase from a Streptomyces species.
AB  - A collagenase active against native, insoluble collagen was isolated from the culture filtrate of a streptomycete which has been designated Streptomyces sp. C-51. Collagenase was produced by growing this strain in media containing gelatin. Purification by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl and DEAE-Cellulofine columns produced active enzyme which was free of contaminating proteins, including nonspecific proteinases, but which contained two active subspecies (I and II). Both subspecies were purified by preparative slab gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weights were 100,000 for the homogeneous fraction I and 90,000-110,000 for the microheterogeneous fraction II. These two subspecies were most active at pH 8-9, very similar in amino acid composition and immunologically identical. Some other properties of the Streptomyces C-51 collagenase were compared with those of Clostridium histolyticum collagenase. Substrate specificity, insensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and sensitivity to certain metal ion complexing agents were similar for the collagenases from both microorganisms.
TI  - Effects of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and dichloromethane on soil biomass and microbial counts.
AB  - Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and dichloromethane in concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 micrograms per 100 g brown soil (dry weight) had different effects on soil microorganisms. The ATP content of the soil biomass decreased significantly in the first and second week of incubation when 100 micrograms of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene were added to the soil, and it was strongly reduced during the two months of the experiment duration when 1000 micrograms of the individual chlorinated solvents under test was added. Similar inhibitory effects could be observed with soil fungi. Tetrachloroethylene in a dose of 1000 micrograms, however, exerted mainly a stimulative influence as shown by the counts of oligotrophic and copiotrophic aerobic soil bacteria and also by the total counts of anaerobic microorganisms. The same concentrations of trichloroethylene and dichloromethane inhibited both groups of aerobic bacteria in the soil. Actinomycetes were mainly inhibited by addition of 1000 micrograms of the volatile chlorinated solvents but they were not affected by lower concentrations. No significant effects were observed in aerobic spore-forming bacteria, and only slight effects were found also in the spore-forming anaerobic microorganisms of Clostridium sp. In conclusion, with the concentrations of chlorinated solvents which were from 10(3) to 10(6) higher than the actual 'in situ' soil contamination, some negative effects on soil microorganisms could be observed. However, one or two month after the soil was contaminated, the microbial counts increased again.
TI  - Raw beef, pork and chicken in Japan contaminated with Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  - One hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in Shimane Prefecture, Japan, were examined for the presence of Salmonella sp. (Sal), Campylobacter jejuni (Cj), Campylobacter coli (Cc), Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye), and Clostridium perfringens (Cp) from April 1984 to March 1985. A total of 205 isolates of Sal (112 strains), Cj (64 strains), Cc (one strain), Ye (7 strains) and Cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. Sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, Sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, Cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, Cc in 0.8% of pork, Ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and Cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. These enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially Sal and Cj. Sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, Cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, Ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, Cp was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and Cc from pork and Cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. This investigation showed that a second-contamination of Sal and Cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. It was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially Sal and Cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with Ye during the cold months.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a strictly anaerobic, cellulolytic spore former: Clostridium chartatabidum sp. nov.
AB  - Cellulolytic, strictly anaerobic spore-forming bacteria were isolated from chloroform treated rumen contents. They were different from previously described cellulolytic rumen clostridia in several characteristics. They formed subterminal rod-shaped spores approximately 0.7 micron by 3.5 micron. In broth cultures the growth rate was maximal at 39 degrees C and after log growth extensive autolysis occurred. Fermentation products consisted of acetate, butyrate, hydrogen and ethanol. The GC content was 31%.
TI  - Synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. Most studies evaluated therapy against Bacteroides sp. (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group). The combinations found to be most effective against B. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. Against Bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. Occasional synergy was observed against Clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. Synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.
TI  - Antagonistic effect exerted by three strictly anaerobic strains against various strains of Clostridium perfringens in gnotobiotic rodent intestines.
AB  - Our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. Gnotobiotic mice harboring a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a Fusobacterium necrogenes, and a Clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic B, C, and D C. perfringens serotypes. A drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic C. perfringens serotype A (CpA). It was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. No diffusible inhibitory substances against CpA were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. In vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of CpA, whereas CpA did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. A reverse correlation between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of CpA was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. Thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. However, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. Whatever factors that may be responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. Studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium genera and AFGPC are also presented. The organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess, and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. These strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. The relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. With few exceptions, possession of a capsule made Bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the nitrogenase iron protein of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.
AB  - The DNA sequence was determined for the cloned Thiobacillus ferrooxidans nifH and part of the nifD genes. A putative T. ferrooxidans nifH promoter was identified whose sequences showed perfect consensus with those of the Klebsiella pneumoniae nif promoter. Two putative consensus upstream activator sequences were also identified. The amino acid sequence was deduced from the DNA sequence. In a comparison of nifH DNA sequences from T. ferrooxidans and eight other nitrogen-fixing microbes, a Rhizobium sp. isolated from Parasponia andersonii showed the greatest homology (74%) and Clostridium pasteurianum (nifH 1) showed the least homology (54%). In a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the Fe proteins, the Rhizobium sp. and Rhizobium japonicum showed the greatest homology (both 86%) and C. pasteurianum (nifH 1 gene product) demonstrated the least homology (56%) to the T. ferrooxidans Fe protein.
TI  - Etiological agent and primary source of infection in 42 cases of focal intracranial suppuration.
AB  - The microbiological findings for 42 patients with focal intracranial suppuration  were analyzed and correlated with the different sources of primary infection. Streptococcus spp. were identified in focal intracranial suppuration of all origins except postcraniotomy. Microaerophilic streptococci were important in cases secondary to respiratory tract infection and in those of unknown origin. Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis were the organisms most commonly found in polymicrobial otogenic abscesses. Clostridium sp. was the main microorganism implicated in postcraniotomy suppurations.
TI  - Anaerobic fermentation of woody biomass pretreated with supercritical ammonia.
AB  - The degradability of ground hardwood by thermophilic anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium thermocellum with or without Thermoanaerobacter strain B6A) was greatly enhanced by pretreatment of the substrate with supercritical ammonia. Relative to C. thermocellum monocultures, cocultures of C. thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacter strain B6A degraded 1.5-fold more pretreated soft maple but produced 2- to 5-fold more fermentation endproducts because Thermoanaerobacter sp. removed reducing sugars produced by C. thermocellum during the fermentation. Dry weight losses were not totally accounted for in end products, due to formation of partially degraded material (<0.4 mum diameter wood particles) during the fermentation. One pretreated hardwood, Southern red oak, was fermented poorly because it released soluble inhibitors at the 60 degrees C incubation temperature. Considerable (6- to 11-fold) increases in substrate degradability were also noted for supercritical ammonia-pretreated wood materials fermented in an in vitro rumen digestibility assay. Degradation of pretreated softwoods by either thermophilic or mesophilic fermentation was not measurable under the conditions tested.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a streptomycete collagenase.
AB  - A soil streptomycete designated as Streptomyces sp. A8 produced an extracellular  collagen hydrolysing enzyme that appeared to be 'true collagenase' as it degraded native collagen under physiological conditions and cleaved the synthetic hexapeptide 4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycyl-L-prolyl-D-a rginine into two tripeptides. The enzyme was purified by diethyl aminoethyl cellulose chromatography and Sephadex G-150 gel filtration. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of about 75,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment with lithium chloride did not dissociate it into subunits. A strong inhibition was observed with chelating agents such as alpha-alpha-dipyridyl and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Ethylene diamine tetraacetate completely inhibited the enzyme activity. Among the cations tested only Ca2+ and Mg2+ enhanced the collagenase activity. Heavy metal ions like Pb2+, Ag+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ strongly inhibited the enzyme. The EDTA inhibition could be reversed with Ca2+. Cysteine and reduced glutathione caused significant reduction in enzyme activity. Parachloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide had no effect on the collagenase. Amino acid analysis revealed the absence of cysteine and tyrosine. Many of the properties were the same as collagenases of Clostridium histolyticum and Vibrio alginolyticus.
TI  - Nucleotide stereochemistry in the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase reaction.
AB  - In a recent study, we have shown that N10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase prefers (Sp)-MgATP beta S over the Rp isomer in the forward reaction. In this report the stereochemistry of ATP beta S produced from prochiral ADP beta S in the reverse reaction was determined. The ATP beta S product was purified and tested as a substrate for hexokinase (preference for the Rp isomer), adenylate kinase (preference for the Sp isomer) and N10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. A comparison of kinetic constants for the product and the authentic Sp and Rp isomers shows that the product is the Sp diastereomer. 31P NMR was also used to identify the product as (Sp)-ATP beta S.
TI  - Lustromycin, a new antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp.
AB  - A new antibiotic, lustromycin, was isolated from the cultured broth of Streptomyces sp. SK-1071. It exhibits selective antibacterial activity against anaerobic bacteria including Clostridium sp. The molecular formula C32H38O13 as determined by high resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis and the NMR spectrum suggest structural resemblance of this antibiotic to luminamicin, an anti-anaerobic antibiotic reported previously.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. The etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). Seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (21), Fusobacterium sp. (8), Streptococcus sp. (5) and Clostridium sp. (4). The organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. Ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. These included all isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis (4) and of Staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 Bacteroides oralis. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.
TI  - Stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by strains of amylolytic bacteria from the rumen and anaerobic digester.
AB  - The stoichiometry of glucose and starch splitting by the amylolytic bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium ruminantium and Clostridium sp. was followed. There were many differences in the ratios of metabolites and in growth yields, as well as in the cell composition, between the growth on glucose and starch. The bacteria employ different nutritional strategies with respect to both energy sources.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. For enterobacteriaceae MICs ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.25); mode MICs varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for Proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for Citrobacter; MICs ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most Enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for Serratia. The rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were Citrobacter or Enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter, with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128. Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. Whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.12). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for Bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). Our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.
TI  - [In vitro activity of roxithromycin, new semisynthetic macrolide against obligate anaerobes].
AB  - The "in vitro" susceptibility to roxithromycin and three other macrolides of 236  anaerobes isolated from clinical samples in 1984/1985 was determined by an agar-dilution method on Wilkins Chalgren medium. 90% of Gram positive cocci were susceptible to both roxithromycin and josamycin (MIC less than 1 mg/l, whereas 1 mg/l erythromycin and 2 mg/l spiramycin were able to inhibit respectively 46 and 86% of the same tested strains. No resistance to the four macrolides was observed among Eubacterium, propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium. Two C. perfringens strains and one C. difficile strain were resistant to all four macrolides, while 97% of Clostridium sp. strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin or roxithromycin. Against Gram positive anaerobes, roxithromycin was equal or superior to erythromycin and spiramycin. At a concentration of 4 mg/l, roxithromycin inhibited 82% of B. fragilis strains. Roxithromycin and josamycin were more active against Gram negative bacilli that erythromycin and spiramycin. Macrolides had no effect on Fusobacterium strains. In this study, 4 mg/l roxithromycin inhibited 217 of the 236 anaerobic strains investigated (92%).
TI  - [Multicenter study of ofloxacin activity on bacteria isolated from a hospital environment].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 1508 bacterial strains isolated in five hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae sensitive to nalidixic acid, MICs ranged from 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml (mode MIC: 0.12); the different species of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12) with the exception of E. coli (0.06-0.12), P. mirabilis (0.5) and Providencia (0.25). Among strains intermediate and resistant to nalidixic acid, most of which were Serratia, Providencia and Citrobacter, 41% had a MIC within the susceptibility range, while the others had a MIC of 2 to 8 micrograms/ml, or even 64 micrograms/ml in a few instances. Ofloxacin also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 16 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 2) for 87% of strains, and A. calcoaceticus, with MICs from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 1). Haemophilus sp. (MIC: 0.008 to 0.06 microgram/ml; mode MIC: 0.03), Gonococci (mode MIC: 0.008), and Meningococci (mode MIC: 0.016) were very sensitive to ofloxacin. The spectrum of ofloxacin included Gram positive cocci: MICs of Staphylococci were 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.5); Enterococci, other Streptococci and Pneumococci were less sensitive, with MICs of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. As for anaerobic bacteria, ofloxacin proved more active against Clostridium (0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml) than Bacteroides (0.5 to 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Substrate and inhibitor activities of the screw sense isomers of metal-nucleotide complexes in the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase reaction.
AB  - Phosphorothioate analogues of ATP and isomers of CrATP and CrADP were used to examine the nucleotide stereoselectivity of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from procaryotic and eucaryotic sources. Substrate activity of the thio-ATP analogues increased as the site of sulfur substitution was changed from the gamma to the alpha position. Thus, adenine nucleotide analogues substituted with sulfur at an alpha nonbridging position (ATP alpha S isomers) were the most active, and ATP gamma S was inactive. When Mg2+ was used as the divalent cation, both enzymes showed a clear preference (higher V/Km value) for the Sp isomer of ATP beta S although the magnitude of the preference was greater with the bacterial enzyme. With Cd2+ as the divalent cation the Rp isomer was preferred, but the difference was greater with the yeast enzyme. Both (Sp)-MgATP beta S and (Rp)-CdATP beta S have the delta or right-hand screw sense configuration of the metal chelate ring. The reversal of stereoselectivity when the cation was changed indicates that the metal ion is coordinated to the beta-phosphate group. No stereoselectivity was observed when ATP alpha S isomers were used in the presence of Mg2+ or Cd2+, suggesting that the metals are not coordinated to the alpha-phosphate. ATP beta S was also found to be a competitive inhibitor of MgATP and CdATP, and the lowest Ki values were obtained with the lambda screw sense isomers. The screw sense isomers of bidentate CrATP exhibited no detectable substrate activity but were competitive inhibitors of MgATP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Multicenter study of the activity of pefloxacin on bacteria isolated in a hospital milieu].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pefloxacin were evaluated by agar dilution for 3422 bacterial strains isolated in nine hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae proved very sensitive to pefloxacin: 62 p. 100 of 1743 strains tested had MIC less than or equal to 0.12 and 90 p. 100 less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml; but the percent of strains with MIC greater than or equal to 2 varied among the different groups of Enterobacteriaceae: 2.7 p. 100 for E. coli to 39 p. 100 for Serratia. 55 p. 100 for Pseudomonas and 81 p. 100 of Acinetobacter were inhibited by 1 micrograms/ml or less (mode MIC 1 and 0.5 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp.: 0.03 and 0.06 micrograms/ml and Gonococci were very sensitive to pefloxacin. The spectrum of pefloxacin extended to Gram positive cocci: MIC of Staphylococci were 0.06 to 8 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.5); Enterococci, other Streptococci and Pneumococci were less sensitive: 2 and 4 micrograms/ml for the majority of strains. Concerning anaerobic bacteria, pefloxacin was more active against Clostridium (0.5 to 1 microgram/ml generally), than against Bacteroides (4 to 16 micrograms/ml).
TI  - The site of cleavage in human alpha chains of IgA1 and IgA2:A2m(1) allotype paraproteins by the clostridial IGA protease.
AB  - Fc fragments of human immunoglobulin A(IgA) of IgA1 subclass and IgA2 subclass of A2m(1) allotype were prepared from IgA paraproteins by digestion with a protease from Clostridium sp. (M.O.-6). The N-terminal tetrapeptide of Val-Pro-Ser-Thr- for the Fc of IgA1 subclass, and that of Val-Pro-Pro-Pro- for the Fc of IgA2:A2m(1) allotype, were identified by sequence analysis. The site of cleavage by the protease was defined to be at the Pro-Val peptide bond, which is a common peptide bond present at 221-222 in both alpha chains. IgA of IgA2 subclass of A2m(2) allotype is resistant to the protease due to the different, Arg-Val, peptide bond at the same position.
TI  - Isolation of a rat intestinal Clostridium strain producing 5 alpha- and 5 beta-bile salt 3 alpha-sulfatase activity.
AB  - An unnamed sporeforming microorganism, termed Clostridium sp. strain S2, possessing bile salt sulfatase activity was isolated from rat intestinal microflora. The microorganism was a strictly anaerobic, nonmotile, gram-negative, asaccharolytic, sporeforming rod requiring CO2, vitamin K, and taurine; the guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNA was 40.8 mol% (Tm), and the strain was tentatively classified as an atypical Clostridium species. Sulfatase activity was specific for 3 alpha-sulfate esters of 5 alpha- and 5 beta-bile salts, leaving the 3 beta-, 7 alpha-, and 12 alpha-sulfates unchanged. Strain S2 also deconjugated tauro- and glyco-conjugated bile salts and partially reduced into the corresponding 6 alpha-hydroxy bile salts. By these reactions, alpha-muricholate and beta-muricholate were more than 80% converted into hyocholate and omega-muricholate, respectively. In addition, strain S2 produced 12 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converting deoxycholate into 3 alpha-hydroxy-12-oxo-5 beta-cholanoate. When strain S2 was associated with gnotobiotic rats, the fecal bile salts were more than 90% desulfated and the fecal excretion of allochenodeoxycholate was five times lower than in control rats.
TI  - Scombroid poisoning: mini-review with case histories.
AB  - Scombroid poisoning has become an almost world-wide medical problem. It is probably the most common cause of fish poisoning, although frequently misdiagnosed as "Salmonella infection'. While there remains some question as to the definitive etiology, there is little doubt that the poisoning is caused by the ingestion of certain mackerel-like fishes whose tissues have undergone a number of changes provoked by bacteria, and involving the conversion of histidine to histamine, potentiated by diamines. Improper storage of the fishes, usually at temperatures above 20 degrees C, appears to be the most important predisposing factor. The organisms most commonly involved are Proteus sp., Clostridium sp., Escherichia sp., Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp. Twenty-five cases of scombroid poisoning are presented. The clinical manifestations were very similar in most cases, consisting of: alterations in taste; anxiety; hyperemia, particularly of the face and neck; nausea; pruritus; headache; certain other symptoms and signs. Most patients responded to antihistamitics, and all cases were self-limiting.
TI  - The influence of the host on expression of intestinal microbial enzyme activities involved in metabolism of foreign compounds.
AB  - The activities of four enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, nitrate reductase and nitroreductase) in selected intestinal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus salivarius) were measured after growth in vitro and in vivo. The five strains differed in their activities with Clostridium sp. being the most active for beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase, and E. coli the most active producer of nitrate reductase. Enzyme activity in vivo tended to be higher than in vitro but there were instances where the comparative activities were reversed.
TI  - Luminamicin, a new antibiotic. Production, isolation and physico-chemical and biological properties.
AB  - A new antibiotic, luminamicin, was isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete strain OMR-59. It exhibits antibacterial activity against anaerobic bacteria, especially against Clostridium sp. The molecular formula of the antibiotic was determined as C32H38O12 on the basis of high resolution mass spectrum, elemental analysis and NMR spectrum.
TI  - Heterologous hybridization of bacterial DNA to the endoglucanases A and B structural genes celA and celB of Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - DNA from various cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria was found to hybridize to Clostridium thermocellum NCIB10682 DNA fragments carrying the structural genes celA and celB which code for endoglucanases A and B. Homology to celA was detected in Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Azospirillum brasilense, Bacillus subtilis, Cellulomonas sp., Clostridium stercorarium, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Pseudomonas solanacearum and Streptomyces griseus. Homology to celB was detected only in B. subtilis, C. stercorarium and E. chrysanthemi. No homology to celA or celB was detected in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Rhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium ORS571 and Trichoderma reesei. Hybridization performed with the homologous strain NCIB10682 and with C. thermocellum LQRI suggested that the two strains were identical in terms of cel genes. In addition, it is likely that the C. thermocellum cel genes, whose number is presently estimated to be at least ten, do not belong to a gene family, since heterologous hybridization was observed only to a single small EcoRI or HindIII fragment homologous to celB.
TI  - The primary structure of thioredoxin from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. 7119.
AB  - Thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. This small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. We here report the complete primary structure of Anabaena thioredoxin. The structure was determined by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. The protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: Ser-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln-Val-Thr-Asp- Ser-Thr-Phe-Lys-Gln-Glu-Val-Leu-Asp-Ser-Asp-Val-Pro-Val-leu-Val-Asp-Phe- Trp-Ala-Pro-Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Arg-Met-Val-Ala-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Glu- Ile-Ala-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Glu-Gly-Lys-Ile-Lys-Val-Val-Lys-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp- Glu-Asn-Pro-Gln-Val-Ala-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Thr-Leu- Met-Ile-Phe-Lys-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Val-Asp-Met-Val-Val-Gly-Ala-Val-Pro- Lys-Thr-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gln-Thr-Leu-Glu-Lys-His-Leu. The sequence of Anabaena thioredoxin shows a definite homology to the protein from Escherichia coli, with 49% residue identities occurring in the proteins when aligned at the active site disulfide.
TI  - The antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a Proteus sp., an Erysipelothrix sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. The intracutaneous injection of Fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to this effect. The in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low MIC; a low MIC was sometimes associated with little action and a high MIC with moderate action. Sixteen organisms were tested. The iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of E. rhusiopathiae. In only one case, with a strain of Proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. On the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-C streptococcus and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, E. rhusiopathiae and A. hydrophila. It is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate excess of readily available Fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). Insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - Aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics. I. Taxonomy, production and biological activity.
AB  - A new species of a new genus of the Actinomycetales was discovered, Kibdelosporangium aridum. This strain produces a new family of glycopeptide antibiotics designated aridicins, that contain an unusual glycolipid constituent. They inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococci, enterococci and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Etiology of acute infectious diarrhea in a highly industrialized area of Switzerland.
AB  - During an 18-mo period between 1981 and 1982, a prospective study was conducted in 119 adult patients with acute diarrhea. A diarrhea-inducing microorganism or toxin could be identified in 38.7% of the patients. Salmonella sp and Campylobacter jejuni were the leading agents that caused diarrheal illness in 25% of the investigated population. Clostridium difficile was found in 6%, mainly after previous antibiotic therapy. Rotavirus was rarely isolated and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were not found. Clinical features in patients in whom an invasive agent was isolated did not differ from those in patients in whom no enteropathogens were found, although the occurrence of fecal leukocytes and positive hemoccult tests in the former group was significantly more frequent. More than 30% of the patients with negative stool cultures, however, showed fecal leukocytes and positive occult blood, which is suggestive of the existence of one or more invasive agent(s) so far unknown or not recognized.
TI  - A novel IgA protease from Clostridium sp. capable of cleaving IgA1 and IgA2 A2m(1) but not IgA2 A2m(2) allotype paraproteins.
AB  - Three bacterial strains of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium sp. from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.B.D.) and Streptococcus pneumoniae from a patient with pneumonia were identified to produce extracellular proteases cleaving IgA into Fab and Fc fragments. Although the proteases from the Bifidobacterium and the Streptococcus pneumoniae showed the characteristics of typical IgA1 proteases, cleaving the IgA of only the IgA1 subclass, the protease from Clostridium sp. revealed a dual substrate specificity, in that it cleaved both IgA1 and IgA2 of the A2m(1) allotype. The latter protease, however, did not show any activity with respect to the IgA2 of the A2m(2) allotype. Fc fragments isolated from the IgA1 and the IgA2 A2m(1) by digestion with the Clostridium sp. protease were identified to have an identical amino terminal residue of valine. The site of cleavage in both the alpha 1 and the alpha 2 of A2m(1) by the protease was assumed to be an identical peptide bond at Pro(221)-Val(222), which is a common one present just before the hinge of both the alpha 1 and the alpha 2 of the A2m(1) but not of the alpha 2 of the A2m(2). The protease was sensitive to ethylene-diamino tetraacetic acid, a chelating agent, similar to other already reported IgA1 proteases.
TI  - [Tinidazole in the therapy of anaerobic pulmonary infections].
AB  - The purpose of the study in 10 patients with anaerobic lung infections was to demonstrate the efficacy of therapy with Tinidazole. In 9 patients, the clinical evaluation as well as X-ray and bacteriological evidence showed positive results of therapy, while in one patient a mixed anaerobic infection with Streptococcus an., Bacteroides frag., and Clostridium sp. was still present after the end of therapy. Side effects were not observed with Tinidazole therapy.
TI  - Empedopeptin (BMY-28117), a new depsipeptide antibiotic. I. Production, isolation and properties.
AB  - Empedopeptin is a new antibiotic produced by empedobacter haloabium nov. sp. (ATCC 31962). It is a water-soluble depsipeptide antibiotic containing eight amino acid residues and a C14-fatty acid moiety in the molecule. Although structurally unrelated, empedopeptin and vancomycin have similar antimicrobial spectra against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria including antibiotic-resistant strains. Empedopeptin is highly active in vivo in mice against systemic infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Empedopeptin is not absorbed orally.
TI  - Simultaneous single-step purification of thiolase and NADP-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase from Clostridium kluyveri.
AB  - Thiolase and NADP-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase from Clostridium kluyveri were purified by ion-exchange chromatography to near homogeneity in a simultaneous, single-step procedure. The yield of both enzymes was greater than 80%. Thiolase was purified approximately 8-fold with sp act 115 units/mg, whereas 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was purified 14-fold with sp act 292 units/mg. Isoelectric points of the enzymes are 7.7 for thiolase and 7.8 for 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Milligram quantities of each of these enzymes are readily obtained from this fatty acid-producing organism.
TI  - Anaerobic ureolytic bacteria from caecal content and soft faeces of rabbit.
AB  - Forty strains of ureolytic bacteria were isolated from the caecal content and soft faeces of seven rabbits by the anaerobic roll tube method and were characterized. The isolates were identified with Clostridium coccoides, Cl. innocuum, Peptostreptococcus productus, P. micros, Peptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium russii and Fusobacterium sp. Urease activity of representative strains of the various species was also determined. The study indicated that strongly-ureolytic anaerobic bacteria are present in the caecum of the rabbit.
TI  - Isolation and Characterization of an Anaerobic, Cellulolytic Bacterium, Clostridium cellulovorans sp. nov.
AB  - A new anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming cellulolytic bacterium is described. Cellulose is cleared within 24 to 48 h around colonies formed in cellulose agar roll tubes. Cells stain gram negative and are nonmotile rods which form oblong spores either centrally or subterminally in a clostridial swelling. Colonies are irregular with an opaque edge and a center devoid of both vegetative cells and spores. Cellulose, xylan, pectin, cellobiose, glucose, maltose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, and mannose serve as substrates for growth. H(2), CO(2), acetate, butyrate, formate, and lactate are produced during fermentation of cellulose or cellobiose. The temperature and pH for optimum growth are 37 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. The DNA composition is 26 to 27 mol% guanine plus cytosine. This bacterium resembles "Clostridium lochheadii" in morphological and some biochemical characteristics but is not identical to it. The name Clostridium cellulovorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 743B (ATCC 35296).
TI  - Purification and separation of individual collagenases of Clostridium histolyticum using red dye ligand chromatography.
AB  - Six collagenases present in the culture filtrate of Clostridium histolyticum have been purified to homogeneity. Chromatography over hydroxylapatite, Sephacryl S-200, and L-arginine-Affi-Gel 202 removes the brown pigment and the great majority of the contaminating proteinases active against casein, benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester, and elastin. Reactive Red 120 dye ligand chromatography subdivides the collagenases, which have very similar physicochemical properties, among four fractions. The final purification is achieved by chromatography over DEAE-cellulose and SP-Sephadex. All six collagenases, designated alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta by the order of their purification, are highly active against collagen and devoid of other proteolytic activities. Each exhibits a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Two distinct subspecies of the alpha and gamma enzymes have been isolated, which have the same molecular weight and activity but different isoelectric points. There is some less pronounced microheterogeneity for the other collagenases. On the basis of their activities toward native collagen and the synthetic peptide 2-furanacryloyl-L-leucylglycyl-L-prolyl-L-alanine (FALGPA), the six collagenases are divided into two classes. Class I collagenases (alpha, beta, and gamma) have high collagenase activity and moderate FALGPA activity while the class II collagenases (sigma, epsilon, and sigma) have moderate collagenase and high FALGPA activities. The relationship between these six collagenases and other reported to have been isolated in the literature has also been examined.
TI  - [In vitro activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on anaerobic bacteria. Comparison with amoxicillin, lamoxactam and metronidazole].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the combination amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AAC) (2/1 w/w) on 84 strains of obligate anaerobes were measured by the agar diffusion method and compared to those of amoxicillin (AMO), lamoxactam (LAM) and metronidazole (MET). For the 47 Bacteroides fragilis strains tested, the mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml with AAC, 1-2 with MET, 0.5-1 with LAM and 8-16 with AMO. A similar range of activity was found on the 16 other strains of Bacteroides sp.. AAC and AMO have a comparable activity on Clostridium perfringens (mode MIC 0.016-0.032 microgram/ml), superior to that of LAM (mode MIC 0.125) and MET (mode MIC 0.5). AAC and AMO have an almost identical activity on Peptococci and Peptostreptococci, the MIC for both drugs being less than 0.125 microgram/ml. A similar activity was found for LAM and MET.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Structural differences between [2Fe-2S] clusters in spinach ferredoxin and in the "red paramagnetic protein" from Clostridium pasteurianum. A resonance Raman study.
AB  - The [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin ("Red paramagnetic protein", RPP) from C. pasteurianum has been found to be composed of two identical subunits of 10,000 +/- 2 000 daltons, each containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Resonance Raman (RR) spectra of RPP have been obtained at 23 degrees K, and compared to those of spinach ferredoxin (Sp Fd). Ten modes of the [2Fe-2S] chromophore were observed in the 100-450 cm-1 range. Assignments of non fundamental modes in the 500-900 cm-1 range allowed correlations between fundamental stretching modes of RPP and Sp Fd. Although assuming a [2Fe-2S] structure, the chromophore of RPP differs from that of Sp Fd by its conformation and by a slight weakening of Fe-S bonds, involving both the inorganic core and the cysteine ligands.
TI  - Development of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of specific pathogen-free chickens.
AB  - The development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, was studied in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. No bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. The flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. A large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. Many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp. and Lactobacillus sp. The flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. These findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels of organisms are much lower. This probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.
TI  - Motility as a factor in bowel colonization by Roseburia cecicola, an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the mouse caecum.
AB  - Roseburia cecicola strain GM is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. Twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain GM (wild-type) that had been exposed to UV light. Unlike GM cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (Fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. Strain GM and two mutant strains, SLS (Fla-) and WES (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization experiments. In separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 X 10(9) to 1.5 X 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. In mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). In mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain GM, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). Mice mono-associated with either strain SLS or strain GM were colonized by one strain each of Escherichia coli, Candida pintolopesii, a Bacteroides sp., and a Clostridium sp. Most (99%) of the R. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. Motility, although not essential for R. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. Motility may thus be essential for R. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.
TI  - Bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tracts of rats receiving thermal injury.
AB  - Rats receiving nonlethal thermal burns over 20 or 40% of their total body surface area were tested at various intervals for the translocation of indigenous bacteria from their gastrointestinal tracts to their mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal cavities, and bloodstreams. No indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control rats or from rats receiving 20% burns. However, 44% of the rats receiving 40% burns exhibited viable Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus sp. and Clostridium sp. in their mesenteric lymph nodes 2 days after thermal injury. Bacterial translocation after burn stress also was tested in antibiotic-decontaminated rats monoassociated with E. coli. E. coli attained population levels in these animals of 10(8) to 10(9) per g cecum. E. coli translocated to 100% of the mesenteric lymph nodes of both the control and 40% burned rats. However, E. coli translocated at a greater incidence to the spleens, livers, and peritoneal cavities of the burned rats compared with translocation to these organs in control rats. The numbers of E. coli translocating to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, and livers also were greater in the 40% burned rats than in control rats. By 14 days after thermal injury, the rats were able to clear E. coli from their spleens and livers, and the infection remained localized in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These results support the concept that the indigenous gastrointestinal flora or exogenous organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract are potential sources of septicemia after thermal injury.
TI  - Utilization of PP(i) as an Energy Source by a Clostridium sp.
AB  - The growth of an anaerobic, spore-forming rod we have isolated from the cockroach gut after enrichment on media containing PP(i) was stimulated by the presence of PP(i). The doubling time decreased and cell yield increased proportionately to PP(i) concentrations of up to 0.35%. A similar stimulation of the growth of Desulfotomaculum sp. by PP(i) has been reported. The PP(i)-stimulated Clostridium sp. fermented a number of sugars with the production of hydrogen, acetate, and butyrate, with smaller amounts of ethanol and butanol being produced from some substrates. The fermentation products were not qualitatively changed by the presence of PP(i), but significantly more hydrogen was produced. The organism contained several of the enzymes previously reported from Entamoeba sp. and Propionibacterium sp., in which PP(i) serves as a source of a high-energy bond in place of ATP. These include significant amounts of pyruvate-phosphate dikinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase. The activities of many of the catabolic enzymes of the organism, as well as of its phosphatases and pyrophosphatase, were similar whether it was grown in the presence or absence of PP(i). The organism did not accumulate intracellular polyphosphate granules but stored large amounts of glycogen.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus sp. strain 100-37 from the murine gastrointestinal tract: ecology, plasmid content, and antagonistic activity toward Clostridium ramosum H1.
AB  - A gram-positive, nonsporulating, microaerophilic rod that had two colonial variants was obtained during a study in which anaerobic bacteria were isolated from murine gastrointestinal tracts and screened for cryptic plasmids. The rod (both colonial variants) was identified as a Lactobacillus sp. (strain 100-37) by selective media, gas chromatography, and biochemical tests. In monoassociated, ex-germfree mice, the bacterium colonized the gastrointestinal tract and formed a thick, continuous layer on the keratinized squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting portion of the stomach. When lysate preparations of both colonial variants were electrophoresed in agarose gels, two bands which stained with ethidium bromide were detected with each lysate. When the DNA preparations were exposed to UV light, the lower ethidium bromide band gradually disappeared while the top band became either broader or more intense. The approximate size of the lower band was 2.2 megadaltons, as determined by comparison with plasmid molecular weight standards. In a search for phenotypes which could be encoded by the cryptic 2.2-megadalton plasmid, we detected an antagonistic activity toward an obligate anaerobe isolated from mouse feces, Clostridium ramosum H1. The antagonistic factor was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (70% saturation) from supernatant solutions of broth cultures of strain 100-37. The factor was not inducible with mitomycin C or UV light, but was stable in flowing steam for up to 50 min, and in buffers of pHs over a range of 1.6 to 6.8. It was nondialyzable and inactivated by trypsin and papain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Influence of pN2 and pD2 on HD formation by various nitrogenases.
AB  - Formation of HD from D2 has been demonstrated with nitrogenase preparations from  Azotobacter vinelandii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Azospirillum sp. We conclude that the formation of HD from D2 is a general property of nitrogenases. However, the nitrogenases differ in their Ki values for D2 (N2 fixation) and in their rates of catalyzing HD formation; among the nitrogenases tested, C. pasteurianum nitrogenase had the lowest activity for formation of HD. When contaminating N2 was removed from the atmospheres above reaction mixtures, less than 1% of the total electron flux in the system was directed to HD formation; hence, we doubt that N2-independent HD formation is significant. A working hypothesis is suggested that operates without invoking an N2-independent reaction for forming HD.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefoxitin in surgery].
AB  - Cefoxitin (CFX) was administered to 13 patients who were admitted to the surgical ward of the hospital. The results of the study as follows; Disc susceptibility tests of the 11 strains isolated from the patients to antibiotic were performed and 10 strains showed good susceptibility to CFX. The clinical response was good in all 4 patients with surgical infections. It is noted that 1 patient with mixed infection caused by E. coli, Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides sp. showed good response to CFX. Out of 9 patients treated with CFX for prophylaxis of postoperative infections, 8 patients responded effectively to CFX, and clinical efficacy rate was 88.9%. No side effects were noted due to CFX. It is considered from these results of the study that CFX is a highly effective and safe drug for treatment of infections and for the prevention of postoperative infections in surgery.
TI  - [Bacteriology of the bile in cholecystopathies. Radiological association].
AB  - A clinicobacteriological survey was undertaken in 55 patients undergoing biliary  surgery, because of chronic and acute cholecystitis. Some radiological preoperative and operative aspects were analised in order to detect any relation of these aspects with biliary tract infection. The bile cultures were positive in 34,5% and 20,0% for aerobes an anaerobes microorganisms respectively. The microorganisms most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Bacteroides sp and Clostridium sp, as aerobian and anaerobian. The statistical analysis showed significance between the presence of bacteria in the biliary tract and pathological operative cholangiography. It had not significance with the radiological preoperative aspects.
TI  - Metabolism of glucose and cellobiose by cellulolytic mesophilic Clostridium sp. strain H10.
AB  - The metabolism of strain H10, a cellulolytic mesophilic Clostridium sp., was studied on glucose and cellobiose as energy and carbon sources. The main products of fermentation of both sugars were acetate, lactate, and ethanol. At low sugar levels, molar growth yields were better for cellobiose than for glucose. In both cases, an inhibition of growth was observed between 1 and 2 g/liter and a total inhibition after the latter concentration. Inhibition was not the result of low pH due to acid formation; growth under static pH conditions was limited in the same way. On the other hand, acetate and lactate had no inhibitory effect when added at concentrations equal to the final titers. Concomitant with the inhibition of growth was a change in metabolic pathways for sugar concentrations between 1 and 2 g/liter, i.e., the production of lactate was higher. After complete inhibition of growth, an accumulation of carbohydrates which were neither glucose nor cellobiose was observed.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of rock cod (Sebastes spp.) stored under elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres.
AB  - The numbers and types of microorganisms on fresh rock cod fillets and fillets stored in air or in a modified atmosphere (MA; 80% CO(2), 20% air) at 4 degrees C were compared. Samples were analyzed after 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of storage. The isolation plates were incubated aerobically, anaerobically, or under MA at 4, 20, or 35 degrees C. After 7 days of storage in air, the fillets were obviously spoiled and had a 3- to 4-log cycle increase in microbial counts. Plate counts increased more slowly on MA-stored fillets. After 21 days, the counts on the latter had increased only 2 log cycles, and the fillets did not seem spoiled. The microbial flora changed greatly during MA storage. Only Lactobacillus spp. (70%) and an Aeromonas sp.-like isolate (30%) were found on plates incubated aerobically at 4 and 20 degrees C, and only Lactobacillus spp. was found on plates incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 35 and at 20 degrees C under MA. Isolation plates incubated at 20 degrees C in air gave the highest counts in the shortest incubation time and the greatest diversity of bacterial types recovered. No Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, or Clostridium botulinum type E were isolated from the fresh or MA-stored fillets.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Nitrous oxide production by organisms other than nitrifiers or denitrifiers.
AB  - Heterotrophic bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants, and animal breath were investigated as possible sources of N(2)O. Microbes found to produce N(2)O from NO(3) but not consume it were: (i) all of the nitrate-respiring bacteria examined, including strains of Escherichia, Serratia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Erwinia, and Bacillus; (ii) one of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing bacteria examined, Azotobacter vinelandii, but not Azotobacter macrocytogenes or Acinetobacter sp.; and (iii) some but not all of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing yeasts and fungi, including strains of Hansenula, Rhodotorula, Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Fusarium. The NO(3)-reducing obligate anaerobe Clostridium KDHS2 did not produce N(2)O. Production of N(2)O occurred only in stationary phase. The nitrate-respiring bacteria produced much more N(2)O than the other organisms, with yields of N(2)O ranging from 3 to 36% of 3.5 mM NO(3). Production of N(2)O was apparently not regulated by ammonium and was not restricted to aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Plants do not appear to produce N(2)O, although N(2)O was found to arise from some damaged plant tops, probably due to microbial growth. Concentrations of N(2)O above the ambient level in the atmosphere were found in human breath and appeared to increase after a meal of high-nitrate food.
TI  - Specificity of bile salt sulfatase activity from Clostridium sp. strains S1.
AB  - Clostridium sp. strain S1, an unnamed bile acid-desulfating strain from rat intestinal microflora (S.M. Huijghebaert, J. A. Mertens, and H. J. Eyssen, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 43:185-192, 1982), was examined for its ability to desulfate different bile acid sulfates and steroid sulfates in growing cultures. Clostridium sp. strain S1 desulfated the 3 alpha-monosulfates of chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and cholic acid, but not their 7 alpha- or 12 alpha-monosulfates. Among the 3-sulfates of the 5 alpha- and 5 beta-bile acids, only bile acid-3-sulfates with an equatorial sulfate group were desulfated. Hence, Clostridium sp. strain S1 desulfated the 3-sulfates of bile acids with a 3 alpha, 5 beta-, a 3 beta, 5 alpha- or a 3 beta, delta 5-structure. In contrast, the bile acid-3-sulfates with a 3 beta, 5 beta- or a 3 alpha, 5 alpha-structure were not desulfated. In addition, Clostridium sp. strain S1 did not hydrolyze the equatorial 3-sulfate esters of C19 and C21 steroids and cholesterol or the phenolic 3-sulfate esters of estrone and estradiol. 23-Nordeoxycholic acid with a C-23 carboxyl group was also not desulfated, in contrast to the 5 beta-bile acid 3 alpha-sulfates with a C-24 or C-26 carboxyl group. Therefore, the specificity of the sulfatase of Clostridium sp. strain S1 is related to the location of the sulfate group on the bile acid molecule, the equatorial orientation of the sulfate group, and the structure of the C-17 side chain, its carboxyl group, and chain length.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of bile acid oxazoline compounds.
AB  - Chenooxazoline (50-100 microM) inhibited (greater than 50%) both 7 alpha and 7 beta-dehydroxylase activities in whole cells and cell extracts of Eubacterium sp. V.P.I. 12708. Chenooxazoline (greater than or equal to 50 microM) and methylchenooxazoline (greater than 25 microM) but not lithooxazoline (less than or equal to 100 microM) inhibited growing cultures of Eubacterium sp. V.P.I. 12708. Chenooxazoline (100 microM) also inhibited the growth of certain members of the genera Eubacterium, Clostridium, Bacteroides and Staphylococcus but not Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Salmonella or the eucaryotic microorganism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (less than or equal to 400 microM).
TI  - Epimerization versus dehydroxylation of the 7 alpha-hydroxyl- group of primary bile acids: competitive studies with Clostridium absonum and 7 alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria (Eubacterium sp.).
AB  - Primary bile acids, chenodeoxycholic (3 alpha,7 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic) and cholic (3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic) were included in cultures of (a) Clostridium absonum alone (b) a mixture of C. absonum and a 7-dehydroxylating organism, Eubacterium sp. (c) a mixture of C. absonum and fecal bacteria, and (d) fecal bacteria alone. C. absonum, when added to Eubacterium sp. cultures totally prevented lithocholic acid formation when the substrate was chenodeoxycholic acid and halved deoxycholic acid formation when the substrate was cholic acid. As expected, formation of 7 beta-hydroxy- and 7-keto-bile acids took precedence over formation of 7 alpha-dehydroxylated bile acids. However, the addition of C. absonum to mixed fecal cultures containing chenodeoxycholic acid did not alter production of lithocholic (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic) acid; instead it enhanced formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid) at the expense of 7-keto-lithocholic acid (3 alpha-hydroxyl-7-oxo-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid). Similarly, the addition of C. absonum to mixed fecal cultures containing cholic acid promoted production of ursocholic acid (3 alpha,7 beta,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid) which did not take place when C. absonum was not added. Surprisingly, deoxycholic acid formation was somewhat enhanced when C. absonum was added to fecal cultures. These studies suggest that successful introduction of "foreign" 7 alpha-epimerizing organisms into animal or human intestines may influence bile acid metabolism in vivo.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of niridazole and metronidazole against anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium  spp., Clostridium spp., and Peptococcus sp.) and of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli to niridazole and metronidazole were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for niridazole ranged from 0.0037 to 1.0 microgram/ml and, for metronidazole, from 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Impact of cefoperazone therapy on fecal flora.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of parenteral cefoperazone therapy upon human fecal flora, fecal specimens obtained from four patients before and during therapy (as well as after therapy for one patient) were cultured quantitatively for facultative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria and for fungi. Cefoperazone therapy was associated with major changes in fecal flora. There was suppression to undetectable levels or an appreciable reduction in all anaerobic bacteria as well as suppression of all initially detected Enterobacteriaceae. During therapy, there was acquisition or an increase in counts of Candida spp., so that these became the most numerous fecal microorganisms in all patients. In addition, Pseudomonas spp. and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. were acquired by three patients. These marked alterations in flora have potentially important consequences.
TI  - Biosynthesis of vitamin B12. Different pathways in some aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
AB  - Radioactivity from [1'-14C]riboflavin was incorporated into the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of Vitamin B12 in the aerobes Bacillus megaterium, Nocardia rugosa and Streptomyces sp. as well as in the aerotolerant anaerobe Propionibacterium freudenreichii, but not in the anaerobe Eubacterium limosum. As recently published for E. limosum, also in the anaerobe Clostridium barkeri radioactivity from [1-14C]glycine and [2-14C]glycine was found in the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, but not in the corrin moiety. The addition of L-[methyl-14C]methionine to C. barkeri led to the labeling of the corrin moiety and the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, showing that the seven "extra" methyl groups in the corrin ring as well as the two methyl groups of the base part originate from this precursor. In Clostridium thermoaceticum, forming the vitamin B12 analog 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide, [1-14C]glycine and [2-14C]glycine were also incorporated into the 5-methoxybenzimidazole moiety, but not into the corrin ring. In E. limosum L-[U-14C]glutamate led to the labeling of the corrin ring of vitamin B12, but not of its base moiety. These results together with data from the literature indicate that a common biosynthetic pathway might exist for the corrinoid biosynthesis in aerobic microorganisms, and in those aerotolerant anaerobes like the Propionibacteria, which form the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of vitamin B12 only under aerobic conditions. They also show that this pathway differs from the pathway found in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) and  to other antibiotics.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 462 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates to N-formimidoyl thienamycin and 16 other currently available and investigational antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution technique. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most organisms tested, especially Bacteroides sp., including clindamycin-resistant strains. All 462 isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and no resistant strains were found in the species tested. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was less active (i.e., had a higher 50% minimal inhibitory concentration) against Fusobacterium sp. than clindamycin, SM-1652, and piperacillin, and less active against Clostridium difficile than metronidazole, but was equally active or more active than the other reference antibiotics tested.
TI  - Methane and hydrogen production by human intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The gas above liquid cultures of a variety of human intestinal anaerobic bacteria was sampled and analysed by headspace gas chromatography. Hydrogen production was greatest with strains of the genus Clostridium, intermediate with anaerobic cocci and least with Bacteroides sp. Very few strains produced methane although small amounts were detected with one strain of B. thetaiotaomicron, C. perfringens and C. histolyticum. There may be a relationship between these anaerobic bacteria and several gastrointestinal disorders in which there is a build up of hydrogen or methane in the intestines.
TI  - delta-Aminolevulinic acid formation. Purification and properties of alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate, aminotransferase and isolation of 4,5-dioxovalerate from Clostridium tetanomorphum.
AB  - L-Alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate aminotransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transamination between alanine and 4,5-dioxovalerate to yield delta-aminolevulinate and pyruvate, has been purified from extracts Clostridium tetanomorphum by acetone precipitation and successive tetanomorphum by acetone precipitation and successive chromatography on Sephadex G-150, hydroxyapatite, Octyl-Sepharose, and SP-Sephadex C-50. The enzyme is pure by the criterion of disc gel electrophoresis with varying polyacrylamide concentrations. It is dimeric, and has an apparent molecular weight of 111,000. Each molecule contains 2 molecules of pyridoxal 5-phosphate. The apparent Km values for 4,5-dioxovalerate and L-alanine are 0.26 and 1.96 mM, respectively. In addition to alanine, glutamate also is an effective amino group donor. The enzyme is inhibited by various keto acids as well as by inhibitors of pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes. It was possible to show that 4,5-dioxovalerate is formed by cultures of C. tetanomorphum when grown in the presence of 0.2 M levulinate, an inhibitor of 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase.
TI  - The gradostat: a bidirectional compound chemostat and its application in microbiological research.
AB  - A multistage continuous culture system is described in which solutes are transferred between vessels in opposite directions simultaneously. The system, called a gradostat, produces opposing solute gradients and is a good laboratory model of many natural microbial ecosystems in which solute gradients are important. Theoretical predictions concerning solute transfer were confirmed under steady-state and non steady-state conditions, using a coloured dye. Paracoccus denitrificans grew anaerobically in the gradostat at the intersection between opposing gradients of succinate and nitrate. Opposing gradients of glucose and oxygen separated the growth of a Bacillus sp. (a facultative anaerobe) and Clostridium butyricum (an obligate anaerobe). Viable counts for both species fell exponentially away from their growth positions at the ends of the gradostat. The potential value of the gradostat and possible alternative conformations are discussed.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - Necrotizing anaerobic infections.
AB  - Severe necrotizing anaerobic infections carry a high mortality. From a retrospective review of 17 cases of gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis and nonclostridial myonecrosis seen at the Victoria and University hospitals in London, Ontario, between Jan. 1, 1975 and Dec. 31, 1977, the most common antecedent was found to be minor trauma. Location of the infection varied; the scrotum and perineum were most commonly involved. Local findings were most frequently edema, skin tenderness and induration. Mixed infections predominated with a pure growth of Clostridium sp. occurring in only three cases. The overall mortality was 29%. The mainstay of treatment after initial administration of fluids followed by broad-spectrum antibiotics is early aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue.
TI  - Relative frequency of Clostridium difficile in patients with diarrheal disease.
AB  - We have studied 161 patients with diarrheal disease to determine the frequency with which Clostridium difficile occurs in such patients. C. difficile or its toxin or both were detected in stools from 19 patients (11.9%), 17 of whom had previously received antimicrobial agents. Enteric pathogens other than C. difficile were recovered less frequently, with Salmonella sp., Giardia lamblia, and Campylobacter fetus being recovered from 4.1, 2.5, and 1.3%, respectively, of the patients studied. These data suggest that C. difficile may be frequently encountered in specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea who receive antibiotics and may play a role in diarrheal disease in such patients.
TI  - Pectinase Activity of Anaerobic and Facultatively Anaerobic Bacteria Associated with Soft Rot of Yam (Diascorea rotundata).
AB  - Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria associated with soft rot of yam (Diascorea rotundata) were isolated by the looping-out method and found to consist of Clostridium (three isolates), Corynebacterium (three isolates), Vibrio (one isolate), and Bacillus lentus (one isolate). Enzyme assay for hydrolase, lyase, and pectinesterase activities by the cup-plate method showed that except for Vibrio sp., B. lentus, and two isolates of Corynebacterium no pectinase activity could be detected for organisms cultured on pectin medium. Most of the cultures on yam tissue, however, showed activities for the three enzymes. The viscometric assay for hydrolase and lyase enzymes indicated a significant level of hydrolase activity (a 40.90% decrease in viscosity for Vibrio sp. and Corynebacterium spp.), but no lyase activity for most of the isolates. Two isolates of Corynebacterium and B. lentus caused changes in fresh yams suggestive of soft rot.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
AB  - Cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. All specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Bacterial growth was present in specimens of 24 of the 28 patients. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were present (40 aerobes and 34 anaerobes). Aerobes alone were isolated from 8 (33%) of culture positive patients, 4 patients (26.7%) yielded only anaerobes, and 12 (50%) had both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fifty isolates (27 aerobes and 23 aerobes) were present in a concentration greater than 10(6) CFU/gm. The most commonly isolated aerobic organisms were P. aeruginosa (9), Proteus sp. (7), K. pneumoniae (5), S. aureus (5), and E. coli (4). The anaerobic bacteria most commonly isolated were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (12), Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 B. fragilis group), Clostridium sp. (3), and Bifidobacterium sp. (3). The above findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  - Rapid temperature programmed gas-liquid chromatography of volatile fatty acids (C1-C7) for the identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A gas liquid chromatography method for the separation of 10 volatile fatty acids  (C1-C7 and isomers) has been improved by using oven temperature programmed conditions. In our conditions, the proprietary stationary phase SP 1220 introduced by Supelco Inc., gave sharp separation of volatile fatty acids in less than 8 min. This method was suitable for analyses with both thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  - Dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. A computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. The computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the API 20E and 50E, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on MacConkey's bile salt medium. Dinitrogen-fixing Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the API analytical profile index. Nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter spp., Azospirillum spp., Derxia sp., Rhodospirillum sp., Clostridium sp., and Bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. The API tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. The use of the API 20E and 50E tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.
TI  - Microbiology of the canine nasal cavities.
AB  - The anterior and superior regions of canine nares yielded two distinct microbial  populations consisting of 25 microbial species. Streptococci predominated in the anterior nose; clostridia and staphylococci were also quite prevalent. At least two distinct microorgranisms were cultured from most anterior sites. In contrast, sterile conditions prevailed in the superior nasal regions of at least 50% of the ninety-two animals. Various Bacillus sp. were recovered from the remainder.
TI  - Bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  - This study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. Additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. The predominant organisms were: B. fragilis (8 specimens); E. coli (6 specimens); Peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of P. aeruginosa and Peptococcus sp. Most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Microbial activity of trench leachates from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites.
AB  - Trench leachate samples collected anoxically from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites were analyzed for total aerobic and anaerobic populations, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, and methanogens. Among the several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated, only Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Citrobacter sp., and Clostridium sp. were identified. Mixed bacterial cultures isolated from the trench leachates were able to grow anaerobically in trench leachates, which indicates that the radionuclides and organic chemicals present were not toxic to these bacteria. Changes in concentrations of several of the organic constituents of the waste leachate samples were observed due to anaerobic microbial activity. Growth of a mixed culture of trench-water bacteria in media containing a mixture of radionuclides, 60Co, 85Sr, and 134,137Cs, was not affected at total activity concentrations of 2.6 X 10(2) and 2.7 X 10(3) pCi/ml.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from pilonidal abscesses in 25 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 76 isolates (63 anaerobic and 13 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, accounting for 2.52 anaerobes and 0.52 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from all the specimens, and in eight cases (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (36 isolates, including ten B fragilis group and ten B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16). Fusobacterium sp (five), and Clostridium sp (four). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli (four) and group D streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Proteus sp (two of each). We believe this study is the first to demonstrate the mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscesses in children.
TI  - The reduction of nitrate to ammonium by a Clostridium sp. isolated from soil.
AB  - Cultures of Clostridium KDHS2 reduced 15NO3- to 15NH4+ with a concurrent increase in molar growth yield of 15.7% compared with fermentatively grown bacteria. The bacteria exhibited a Ks (NO3-) of 0.5 mM and reduced NO3- maximally at a rate of 0.1 mumol h(-1) mg dry wt)-1. A partially purified nitrate reductase was obtained which had a Km (NO3-) of 0.15 mM. The reduction of 13NO3- to 13NH4+ by resting bacteria was not inhibited by NH4+, glutamate, glutamine, methionine sulphoximine or azaserine. Glutamine synthetase affected neither the synthesis nor the activity of the NO3(-)-reducing enzymes. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that NO3- reduction to NH4+ in this Clostridium sp. is dissimilative. SO32-, but not SO42-, inhibited the reaction, apparently at the level of NO2- reduction.
TI  - Chronic otitis media in children. Microbiological studies.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. The middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. Aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 99 aerobic isolates. Aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. There were 74 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium sp. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. Cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.
TI  - Enumeration and relative importance of acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) bacteria in a delaware salt marsh.
AB  - Three groups of N(2)-fixing bacteria were enumerated from the top 1 cm of the surface in four vegetational areas in a Delaware salt marsh. The results over the 9-month sampling period showed that there were no discernible seasonal patterns for any of the groups enumerated (Azotobacter sp., Clostridium sp., and Desulfovibrio sp.). Azotobacter sp. was present in numbers of 10 per g of dry mud, whereas the two anaerobic fixers were present in much lower numbers (10 to 10 per g of dry mud). There were no differences in the numbers of each group among the different vegetational areas, indicating that there was a heterogeneous population of N(2) fixers present. Additional studies indicate that the activity of sulfate reducers (Desulfovibrio sp.) may account for as much as 50% of the total observed acetylene reduction activity. Oxygen was found to exert little effect on the observed acetylene reduction activity, indicating that stable aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments exist in the surface layer of marsh sediments.
TI  - Enumeration of potentially pathogenic bacteria from sewage sludges.
AB  - To ascertain the health risks that may be posed by the land application of sewage sludges, a scheme was devised to determine the types and numbers of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria present in sludges. A processing treatment was adapted to sludge to give a homogenate which yielded the greatest numbers of viable bacteria. Conventional methods were successful in enumerating Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, gram-negative enteric bacteria, and commonly used indicator organisms. Modifications of conventional methods improved the enumeration of Salmonella, Mycobacterium sp., fluorescent Pseudomonas sp., and Clostridium perfringens. However, Shigella methodology yielded only one isolate. Utilizing the proposed scheme, the population densities of these organisms were estimated in three domestic wastewater sludges. In light of these results, the potential impact of land application of sewage sludges is discussed.
TI  - Studies on bacterial cell wall inhibitors. VII. Azureomycins A and B, new antibiotics produced by Pseudonocardia azurea nov. sp. Taxonomy of the producing organism, isolation, characterization and biological properties.
AB  - Two new basic water-soluble antibiotics, azureomycins A and B, were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete, strain AM-3696, designated as Pseudonocardia azurea nov. sp. The antibiotics exhibit moderate antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium and Clostridium. They inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from pediatric patients. A one-year experience.
AB  - During 1975, 115 speciments from the soft tissues, body fluids, and purulent sites in 105 pediatric ward and nursery patients were submitted to the clinical laboratory for anaerobic study, and 75% of the cultures were positive. In most instance specimens were collected in anaerobic transport tubes containing peptone yeast extract and glucose. In the laboratory, samples were processed by the anaerobic holding jar method. Nineteen different anaerobic organisms were isolated; the average number of species per specimen was 1.8 Bacteroides sp were the most common isolates (45 strains). Other isolates included 44 anaerobic cocci (15 of which were Peptostreptococcus sp), 22 Propionibacterium sp, ten Fusobacterium sp, nine Clostridium sp, eight Veillonella sp, six Bifidobacterium sp, and four Eubacterium sp. The main sources of anaerobic isolates included 52 gastric aspirates, 46 soft tissue sites, 14 blood specimens, 12 CSF samples, and 12 samples from the external ear canals. Forty-one (43%) of the 86 specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria also had aerobic organisms present.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - A new nitrogen-fixing Clostridium species from a high Arctic ecosystem.
AB  - A hitherto undescribed species of yellow-pigmented, Gram-negative Clostridium sp., possessing nitrogenase activity, has been isolated from a number of sampling sites on the Truelove Lowland of Devon Island in the Canadian high Arctic. This bacterium, tentatively designated Clostridium arcticum sp. nov., accounted for 19% of all isolates recovered which were capable of anaerobic nitrogen fixation.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
TI  - [Comparative clinical, bacteriological and pathohistological studies of the sex organs of infertile cows].
AB  - Investigations were performed with materials from 39 cows divided into two groups: I -- internal sexual organs of 29 cows slaughtered because of infertility; and II -- biopsy material from 10 cows that showed symptomies sterility. The same material was studied microbiologically and histopathologically by routine methods. The material was taken from the cervix, the uterus, and the horns. Bacteriologically, the presence was established of Str. uberis. E. coli, Str. dysgalactiae, Staph. et albus et citreus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Str. agalactiae, Candida albicans, Clostridium sp., and others. Organisms were also isolated from the genitalia of cows showing no clinical symptoms of endometritis. Histologically, the cervix of the animals in the 1st group presented necrobiosis of the glandular epithelium, and reticulohistiocytic proliferation. Most characteristic were the changes in the uterine corpus where stasis, oedema, low necrobiotic epithelium of the glands, and a surrounding reticulocytic proliferation with the presence of lymphocytes and plasmatic cells were observed. It was found that no direct correlation between the histologic changes, the microbiologic, and the clinic results.
TI  - Introduction to mechanisms of association of indigenous microbes.
AB  - Indigenous microorganisms of numerous types associate with epithelial surfaces in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds. Some of the microbial types, e.g., Lactobacillus sp. in the stomachs of laboratory rodents, adhere to a surface without altering it ultrastructurely. In such cases, the adherence is mediated undoubtedly by macromolecules on the bacterial surfaces, possibly polysaccharides in most cases, interacting in specific ways with receptor macromolecules on the epithelial surface. Other microbial types that associate with epithelial surfaces without altering them ultrastructurally, e.g., Clostridium 109-2 in the mouse large bowel, may adhere to the surface only weakly or not at all, and maintain the association because they are motile and attracted to the epithelium by chemotactic substances. Microbial types that alter the ultrastructure of the epithelial cells to which they attach interact intimately with the membranes of the epithelial cells. In such cases, the microbes have specialized segments or ends for adhering to the membranes, and probably elaborate systems for stabilizing the membranes and cytoplasm at the site in the epithelial cell to which they attach. Some such organisms may have evolved unique reproductive mechanisms to maintain their populations on the epithelial surface.
TI  - Microbial metabolism of amino alcohols. Purification and properties of coenzyme B12-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1. The 120-fold purification of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase from Escherichia coli  extracts, to apparent homogeneity, is described. Ethanolamine, dithiothreitol, glycerol and KCl protected the apoenzyme from inactivation. 2. At the optimum pH7.5, K(m) values for ethanolamine and coenzyme B(12) were 44mum and 0.42mum respectively. The K(m) for ethanolamine was markedly affected by pH, transitions occurring at pH7.0 and 8.35. 3. The enzyme was specific for ethanolamine as substrate, none of the 18 analogues tested being active. l-2-Aminopropan-l-ol (K(i) 0.86mum), dl-1-aminopropan-2-ol (K(i) 2.2mum) and dl-1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol (K(i) 88.0mum) inhibited competitively. 4. Enzyme activity was inhibited, irreversibly and non-competitively, by the coenzyme analogues methylcobalamin (K(i) 1.4nm), hydroxocobalamin (K(i) 2.1nm) and cyanocobalamin (K(i) 4.8nm). 5. Iodoacetamide inhibited in the absence of ethanolamine, but only slightly in its presence. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibited markedly even in the presence of ethanolamine. Dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol (less effectively) restored activity to the enzyme dialysed against buffer containing ethanolamine. 6. Although K(+) ions stabilized the enzyme during dialysis or storage, they were not necessary for activity. 7. Gel filtration showed the enzyme to be of high molecular weight, ultracentrifugal studies giving s(20,w) of 16.4 and an estimated mol.wt. 560400. The isoelectric point for the apoenzyme was approx. pH5.0. inhibited enzyme activity at concentrations above 1m (95% inhibition at 3m) and sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated protein subunits of mol.wt. 61400. 8. Immunological studies showed that the E.coli enzyme was closely related to those of other enterobacteria, but only distantly to that of Clostridium sp. A double precipitin band suggested that the apoenzyme may be made up of two protein components.
TI  - Increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin A plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  - Various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. The mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. The strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Actinobacillus, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones) are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Escherichia have an immunogenic effect. The same result was obtained with Bacteroides and Escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. The kinetics of appearance of intestinal IgA plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. The association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal IgA plasmocytes as that obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. The maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. The orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, E. coli and Bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in a modern operating suite. 4. Bacterial contamination of clothes worn in the suite.
AB  - Clean clothes in the staff dressing rooms were heavily contaminated with bacteria, mainly Bacillus sp., but Staphylococcus aureus were found on 14% and Clostridium sp. on 10% of the garments examined. A comparison of the occurrence of Staph. aureus on shirts worn by staff in wards and operating departments showed ward shirts to be contaminated more heavily and with more strains. Examination of sterile gowns worn by surgeons showed that 70% were contaminated with Staph. aureus after operation. Of the strains isolated 31% were identical with those carried by the surgeon or by the patient operated on, but for the remainder no source could be found.
TI  - Monensin, Eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - Bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. Within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. With clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. Infection with Eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of C. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. With Bacteroides sp. or Streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. In contrast to C. perfringens, populations of Bacteroides sp. and S. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with E. tenella. Duodenal populations of C. perfringens, Bacteroides sp., and S. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.
TI  - Production of an antibiotic substance by Bacillus licheniformis within the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - In monoxenic mice, vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus licheniformis were enumerated and in vivo antibiotic production was measured at various levels of the digestive tract and in the feces. The apparent independence of vegetative cell and spore populations in the cecum and feces, as well as the marked fluctuations of these two populations in the stomach and small intestine, suggested that sporulation of B. licheniformis and production of antibiotic occur only in the upper levels of the digestive tract. Study of dixenic models wherein B. licheniformis was inoculated after Clostridium perfringens or Lactobacillus sp. or before Lactobacillus sp. revealed the simultaneous disappearance of B. licheniformis from the stomach and antibiotic from the feces. This strain persisted in the cecum, but only in the form of vegetative cells. These models demonstrate that the activity of the microflora in the upper segments can affect the equilibrium of the microflora throughout the digestive tract.
TI  - A modified procedure for the purification of clostridial collagenase.
AB  - A method is described for the purification of clostridial collagenase from a crude enzyme preparation employing cation exchange chromatography on SP Sephadex, anion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. Emphasis was placed on purity using continuous shallow gradients for the ion exchange separations to increase resolution and monitoring eluates both with respect to ultraviolet light absorption at 230 nm and analytical disc gel acrylamide electrophoresis. In addition, protein fractions were assayed for collagenolytic and non-specific proteolytic activity. The purity of the final preparation was assessed by acrylamide electrophoresis, gel filtration and amino acid analysis. The isolated enzyme hydrolyzed between 30 and 40% of rat tail tendon collagen in 1 h at 37 degrees C and lacked measurable trypsin or elastase-like activity.
TI  - The effect of rifampicin on the developmental phases of germinating spores of Clostridum sp., MSp+.
AB  - The effect of rifampicin on the developmental phases of germinating spores of Clostridium botulinum, MSp+, has been studied. At sublethal concentrations of rifampicin (0.05 ng/ml) the time periods required for outgrowth and vegetative growth was significantly prolonged because of the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. However, rifampicin had essentially no effect on DNA synthesis or on subsequent spore formation. Chemical analyses showed that the amount of protein present in vegetative cells of the rifampicin-treated cultures was twice as great as in the untreated cultures but the total protein content of endospores was the same in both cases. It was revealed in ultrastructural studies of rifampicin (0.1 ng/ml) treated cultures, examined after 22 h, that septum formation and normal cell division of the emerging cell was blocked and a few cells showed constriction which produced one normal and one protoplast-like daughter cell.
TI  - Media supplemented with nalidixic acid for the isolation of gram negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nalidixic acid were determined for thirty-four strains of Clostridium sp. by an agar dilution technique. The MIC range of Clostridium perfringens ran from 0.03 microgram/ml to 64 microgram/ml, according to a bimodal distribution. One half of the strains was inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. 64 microgram/ml was able to inhibit all the strains tested. The author suggests a systematic utilization of media with and without 40 microgram/ml nalidixic acid. These two media were parallely inoculated with clinical specimens where anaerobic bacteria were suspected, and allowed the isolation of gram negative anaerobes.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of extremely oxygen-sensitive clostridia from the microflora  of conventional mice and of Escherichia coli against Shigella flexneri in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Two extremely oxygen-sensitive strains of Clostridium sp., designated Clostridium E and P, were obtained from digestive microflora of conventional mice and found to constitute a barrier against Shigella flexneri SF-2 when associated in vivo with Escherichia coli K-12. These and other simplified fractions of the conventional microflora were demonstrated to have an effect comparable to that of the total flora. When K-12 and Clostridium E were established in gnotobiotic mice before the introduction of SF-2, the latter was reduced to a level below detection in the digestive tract. Whe SF-2 was established first, the antagonistic effect exerted by Clostridium E and K-12 was variable and, apparently, related to the rate of establishment of Clostridium E. Mutants of SF-2 resistant to the barrier effect of Clostridium E and K-12 appeared at the end of 3 months when SF-2 was established in gnotobiotic mice alone or with K-12, and after only a week when SF-2 was associated only with Clostridium E. These results suggest that the bacterial antagonsim in this model is related to the production in vivo of an antibiotic substance active against SF-2. It appears that the substance may be produced by Clostridium E, stimulated by K-12.
TI  - Urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  - A growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. Using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that Peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. Also, some fecal strains of Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium innocuum, and Clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. Single strains of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus catus, and Streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. Urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. They include Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Treponema sp., Ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), Butyrivibrio sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides ruminicola, and P. productus. Most P. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. The urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and Trypticase.
TI  - Specific inhibition of viral neuraminidases by an inhibitor, neuraminin, produced by Streptomyces sp.
AB  
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - Isolation and identification of fecal bacteria from adult swine.
AB  - An examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. Total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 X 10(10) to 7.40 X 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). Comparison of different nonselective roll tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (M98-5). Recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with M10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (RGCA) media. Rumen fluid, Trypticase, sugars, and CO2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. Similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with M98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or M10 plus swine cecal extract. Significantly lower recoveries were observed with RCGA, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. Ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., and Propionibacterium acnes. The remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and Escherichia coli. Rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), Trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. Variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. This work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in 98 strains of anaerobic  bacteria that came from clinical samples against fosfomycin, penicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and lincomycin. The results obtained indicate that fosfomycin is usually inactive against Bacteroides sp. and is active up to 32 mug/ml or less against 85% of Peptococcus and 95% of Peptostreptococcus, being consequently comparatively less active than the rest of the antibiotics that were tested against Bacteroides, sp., while against Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus it is less active than penicillin, cephalothin, clindamycin and lincomycin, and somewhat more active than chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
TI  - Coenzyme B-12-dependent reactions. Part IV. Observations on the purification of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase.
AB  - Purification of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.7) from a Clostridium sp. grown at the University of Sussex, U.K. and the National Institutes of Health, U.S.A., has been compared and an improved isotopic assay for the enzyme has been developed. Successful purification of this enzyme from Sussex-grown cells requires modification of the published procedure (Kaplan and Stadtman (1968) J. Biol, Chem. 243, 1787-1793) principally a 70% decrease in volume during precipitation with 0.4 M NaCl. This modification also increases the yield from N.I.H.-grown cells. Purified enzyme, resolved of inactive cobalamins, has the same high specific activity from both sources and behaves in the same way on disc gel electrophoresis. Sussex enzyme, before resolution, has less than 20% of the specific activity of unresolved N.I.H. enzyme and contains over 50% more inactive cobalamin. The bound cobalamin from both preparations has been identified as a "base-on" Co11 psi-cobalamin.
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Growth and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum in moldy tomato juice.
AB  - Tomato juice inoculated with Cladosporium sp. or Penicillium sp. developed pH gradients with the upper portions near the mold mats having pH values near neutrality and the lower portions remaining more acid. Clostridium botulinum spores in these moldy tomato juices germinated, grew out, and produced toxin.
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - The size pH, and redox potential of the cecum in mice associated with various microbial floras.
AB  - Cecal size and in situ redox potential and pH of cecal contents were determined in conventionally reared mice and mice reared under a variety of gnotobiotic conditions: germfree, monoassociated with a cecal Clostridium sp., hexaflora-associated and thermoduric polyflora-associated. The mean Eh was approximately +200 mV in germfree and -200 mV in conventional mice. The Eh was close to zero in the monoassociated mice, thus occupying a position intermediate between the germfree and conventional mice. The potentials observed in the hexaflora and the thermoduric flora groups were indistinguishable from those of conventional animals. The degree of normalization was more advanced with respect to the redox potential than to the cecal size in the various gnotobiotic groups. In the thermoduric polyflora-associated group, normalization was observed in both cecal size and redox potential. This demonstrates that normalization can be accomplished with a relatively simplified microflora, at least with regard to the parameters studied.
TI  - Characterization of anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria isolated from freshwater lake sediments.
AB  - Strict anaerobic culture techniques were used to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria present at the sediment-water interface of hyperutrophic Wintergreen Lake (Augusta, Mich.). Anaerobic plate counts remained constant from March through December, 1973, ranging from 2.4 X 10(6) to 5.7 X 10(6) organisms/g (dry weight) of sediment. The isolatable bacteria represented a small percentage of the total microbial community, which was shown by direct microscopic counts to be 2.0 X 10'' organisms/g (dry weight) of sediment during June and July. Bacteria of the genus Clostridium dominated the isolates obtained, accounting for 71.8% of the 960 isolates examined. A single species, Clostridium bifermentens, comprised 47.7% of the total. Additional bacterial groups and the percentage in which they were isolated included: Streptococcus sp. (10.8%), unidentified curved rods (9.5%y, gram-positive nonsporing rods (5.6%), and motile gram-negative rods (1.9%). Temperature growth studies demonstrated the ability of all the isolates to grow at in situ sediment temperatures. Gas-liqid radiochromatography was used to determine the soluble metabolic end products from [U-14C]glucose and a U-14C-labeled amino acid mixture by representative sedimentary clostridial isolates and by natural sediment microbial communities. At in situ temperatures the natural sediment microflora produced soluble fermentative end products characteristic of those elaborated by the clostridial isolates tested. These results are considered strong presumptive evidence that clostridia are actively metabolizing in the sediments of Wintergreen Lake.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - The relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  - The capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and its conjugates. It was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of PNBA to PABA; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. Various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. In assoication with Lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of PNBA to PABA increased to 3.9%. When these rats were further associated with Clostridium sp. and Streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. A general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce PNBA in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. Cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce PNBA. Similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by the flora. Evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.
TI  - A review of 105 necropsies in captive baboons (Papio cynocephalus).
AB  - In contrast to the findings in newly caught babboons in Africa, the leading cause of death in captivity in America was a pneumonia and enteritis complex. Bacterial species such as Proteus morgani, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas paracolon, pathogenic Escherichia coli and cocci have been isolated in association with a pneumoenteric syndrome of 35 newborn baboons, including neonates. The majority of these animals died with pulmonary factors such as anoxia and pneumonia.
TI  - Psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic triosephosphate isomerases from three clostridial species.
AB  - Triosephosphate isomerase was purified to homogeneity as judged by analytical gel electrophoresis from clostridium sp. strain 69, clostridium pasteurianum, and C. thermosaccharolyticum, which grow optimally at 18, 37, and 55 C, respectively. Comparative studies on these purified proteins showed that they had the same molecular weight (53,000) and subunit molecular weight (26,500). They were equally susceptible to the active site-directed inhibitor, glycidol phosphate. However, their temperature and pH optima, as well as their stabilities to heat, urea, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, differed. The proteins also had different mobilities in acrylamide gel electrophoresis. This difference in ionic character was also reflected in the elution behavior of the enzymes from hydroxyapatite and in the isoelectric points determined by isoelectric focusing in acrylamide gel. The amino acid composition of these proteins showed that the thermophilic enzyme contains a greater amount of proline than the other enzymes. The ratio of acidic amino acids to basic amino acids was 1.79, 1.38, and 1.66 for the thermophilic mesophilic and psychrophilic enzymes, respectively. This is consistent with the relative isoelectric point values of these three enzymes.
TI  - The preparation of a bacterial collagenase containing negligible non-specific protease activity.
AB  - A three stage procedure for the purification of crude bacterial collagenase is described. The three stages were ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex and DEAE-cellulose, followed by molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-200. The end product was eluted from Sephadex G-200 as a single peak of absorbance at 280 nm, and a single zone of activity against gelatin. The active eluate was divided into two halves, designated fraction 1 and 2 collagenase. Their activities were greater than those of commercially available collagenases when assayed viscometrically against pepsin solubilized collagen from guinea-pig skins. The non-specific protease activities in both fractions were much less than in the commercially available purified collagenases, and fraction 1 collagenase liberated only 2.6% of a [3H]-tryptophan label from a substrate of 2 mg of labelled chick embryo proteins, after an 18 hour incubation. When polymeric collagen was incubated with fraction 1 collagenase, at a final enzyme : substrate ratio of 1:160, the collagen was digested, resulting in the loss of 99.8% hydroxyproline as dialysable material.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an esterase-active enzyme from pronase with special reference to activation of Clostridium botulinum type E progenitor toxin.
AB  - (1) By sequential chromatography on CM-Sephadex, SP-Sephadex and Sephadex G-100,  an esterase-active enzyme was isolated from a commercial preparation of pronase, (2) The purity of the isolated enzyme was proven by disc electrophoresis and sedimentation analysis. (3) The molecular weight of the esterase-active enzyme was approximately 16,000. The sedimentation coefficient was 1.85 S. The N- and C-terminal amino acids were asparagine and valine, respectively. (4) The enzyme was similar to that of bovine trypsin in the substrate specificity. It appeared to be the same as the trypsin-like enzyme isolated from pronase by Wahyby (1968). However, the relative rates of hydrolyses of different substrates by the enzyme differed from those of bovine trypsin. (5) The enzyme activated Clostridium botulinum type E progenitor toxin. Even a higher toxicity was resulted by treating the progenitor toxin with this enzyme than with bovine trypsin. (6) The results support the hypothesis that activation of type E progenitor toxin involves hydrolysis of a lysine ester bond.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
TI  - Sporicidal properties of hydrogen peroxide against food spoilage organisms.
AB  - The sporicidal properties of hydrogen peroxide were evaluated at concentrations of 10 to 41% and at temperatures of 24 to 76 C. The organisms tested and their relative resistance at 24 C to 25.8% H(2)O(2) were: Bacillus subtilis SA 22 > B. subtilis var. globigii > B. coagulans > B. stearothermophilus > Clostridium sp. putrefactive anaerobe 3679 > S. aureus, with "D" values of 7.3, 2, 1.8, 1.5, 0.8., and 0.2 min, respectively. Heat shocking spores prior to hydrogen peroxide treatment decreased their resistance. Wet spores were more resistant than dry spores when good mixing was achieved during hydrogen peroxide treatment. Inactivation curves followed first-order kinetics except for a lag period where the inactivation rate was very slow. Increasing the H(2)O(2) concentration and the temperature reduced the lag period.
TI  - Ribosomes, polyribosomes, and deoxyribonucleic acid from thermophilic mesophilic, and psychrophilic clostridia.
AB  - Analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from four species of Clostridium, including two thermophiles, a mesophile, and a psychrophile, revealed no obvious relationship between growth temperature and DNA base composition. The melting temperatures (T(m)) of the DNA from the four species varied no more among the thermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic species than among many related mesophilic species. Characterization of ribosomes from the clostridia by means of optical rotatory dispersion yielded similar spectra in common with other unrelated organisms. Only small differences were noted in the base composition of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) and in the amino acid composition of ribosomal proteins, including half-cystine content, as determined by cysteic acid analysis, and accessible sulfhydryl groups, as determined by titration with dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). Except for the two thermophiles, the ribosomal protein electrophoretic patterns were dissimilar. No unusual thermal stability was manifested in the T(m) values of thermophile ribosomal RNA. However, thermophile ribosome T(m) values (69 C) were higher than were mesophile and psychrophile T(m) values (64 C). Ribosomes from the four clostridial species were also examined in regard to the effect of heat on their functional integrity, measured by their activity in poly U-directed (14)C-phenylaline incorporation, and their gross physical integrity, measured by sucrose gradient analysis. The T(d, 5) values (temperature which produces 50% inactivation after 5 min) was found to be 70 and 72 C for the two thermophiles C. tartarivorum and C. thermosaccharolyticum, respectively; 57 C for a mesophile, C. pasteurianum; and 53 C for a psychrophile, Clostridium sp. strain 69. At 55 C, little effect was seen on the thermophile ribosomes, but the mesophile ribosomes lost 90% of their activity in 1 hr, and psychrophile ribosomes lost 100% of their activity within 10 min. According to sucrose gradient profiles, heating at 55 C results in dissociation of mesophile ribosomes and aggregation of psychrophile ribosomes. Thermophile S-100 fractions were also more thermostable than were mesophile or psychrophile S-100 fractions. The T(d, 5) values were 69 C for C. tartarivorum and C. thermosaccharolyticum S-100 and 41 C for C. pasteurianum and Clostridium sp. strain 69 S-100. The effect of heat on the endogenous incorporation of (14)C-valine by polysomes was also examined. In the case of thermophile polysomes, the extent of incorporation at 55 and 37 C was about equal. In the case of mesophile and psychrophile polysomes, the extent at 55 C was 44 and 39%, respectively, of the value at 37 C. The initial rates of incorporation in all four cases were greater at 55 C than at 37 C.

AB  - Clostridium barkeri sp. n. has been described, and its relationship to other clostridia is discussed.
TI  - Sporulation and enterotoxin production by mutants of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The ability of Clostridium perfringens type A to produce an enterotoxin active in human food poisoning has been shown to be directly related to the ability of the organism to sporulate. Enterotoxin was produced only in a sporulation medium and not in a growth medium in which sporulation was repressed. Mutants with an altered ability to sporulate were isolated from an sp(+) ent(+) strain either as spontaneous mutants or after mutagenesis with acridine orange or nitrosoguanidine. All sp(0) (-) mutants were ent(-). Except for one isolate, these mutants were not disturbed in other toxic functions characteristic of the wild type and unrelated to sporulation. A total of four of seven osp(0) mutants retained the ability to produce detectable levels of enterotoxin. None of the ent(-) mutants produced gene products serologically homologous to enterotoxin. A total of three sp(-) mutants, blocked at intermediate stages of sporulation, produced enterotoxin. Of these mutants, one was blocked at stage III, one probably at late stage IV, and one probably at stage V. A total of three sp(+) revertants isolated from an sp(-) ent(-) mutant regained not only the ability to sporulate but also the ability to produce enterotoxin. The enterotoxin appears to be a sporulation-specific gene product; however, the function of the enterotoxin in sporulation is unknown.

These strains are proteolytic, lecithinolytic, only slightly saccharolytic, often form cells with two spores, and appear unlike any described species of terminal-spored, proteolytic anaerobe. The name Clostridium oceanicum is suggested. The type strain (no. 25647) is deposited in the American Type Culture Collection.

TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.

Data demonstrated that fish inoculated with 10 or more viable C. botulinum spores regularly develop specifically neutralizable enrichment cultures. Mild heat treatment (60 C, 15 min) substantially reduced the sensitivity of enrichment culturing. This effect was particularly noticeable in the culturing of fish which harbored fewer than 10 spores each. Evidence is presented which indicates that sensitivity of enrichment, without heat, approaches the level of one spore per fish. Smoked whitefish chubs, containing from one to several hundred spores each, were examined for toxin content after storage at 5, 10, 15, and 28 C for as long as 32 days. The lowest temperature at which detectable toxin was produced was 15 C. This occurred in 1 of 10 fish incubated for 14 days. C. botulinum was regularly recovered, by enrichment culture, from fish inoculated with small numbers of spores, even though toxin was not detected by direct extraction of incubated fish. Persistence of C. botulinum type E spores was observed to decline with an increase in the temperature and time at which inoculated fish were stored.

TI  - Numerical data concerning the sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
AB  - Upon comparison of results obtained from growing eight different species of anaerobic bacteria in deep agar under two and three atm of pure oxygen with results of growing them in air under atomospheric pressure, it appears possible that the old terms of "microaerophobic," "very strict anaerobe," and "microaerophilic" can be replaced by precise values corresponding to the size of the inhibition zone produced by oxygen under various pressures when the bacteria are grown in a solid medium. The simultaneous effect of the dilution of the inoculum and the pressure of oxygen used was determined with the help of an electronic computer according to the standard multiple regression method. Two indices have been worked out which express the sensitivity of the species at different oxygen pressures when varying numbers of anaerobic bacteria are used: X sp, which is the size in millimeters of the inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under pure oxygen at atmospheric pressure (lp=0), and B sp, which is the result of multiplying by 1.43 the difference in size of inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under atmospheric air (lp = -0.7) and under pure oxygen at 1 atm absolute.
TI  - Clostridium spores with ribbon-like appendages.
AB  - Spores of Clostridium sp. N1 are characterized by numerous broad ribbon-like appendages attached to one end. The appendages are two to three times the length of the spore and, at their maximal dimension, may be two-thirds the width of the spore. They are attached to the spore body by a common trunk which is continuous with the outer spore coat. Each appendage is a multilayered structure and is enclosed in an amorphous material. Details of spore and appendage formation are described, and appendage ultrastructural features are presented. The function of the appendages is not known.

TI  - CLOSTRIDIUM RUBRUM SP. N. AND OTHER PECTINOLYTIC CLOSTRIDIA FROM SOIL.
AB  - Ng, Henry (University of California, Davis) and Reese H. Vaughn. Clostridium rubrum sp. n. and other pectinolytic clostridia from soil. J. Bacteriol. 85:1104-1113. 1963.-Reports in the literature and results of experiments described herein suggest that pectinolytic anaerobes constitute a very heterogeneous group. The cultures isolated in this study all belonged to the genus Clostridium. The following species were identified: C. butyricum, C. fallax, C. multifermentans, and C. indolis. In addition, a species believed to be previously undescribed was named C. rubrum sp. n. The ability to ferment galacturonic acid was found to be adaptive. Some cultures fermented pectin and pectic acid to the same degree, whereas others fermented pectin only partially. The partial fermentation was attributed to the lack of a pectinesterase. On the basis of fermentation balances, it was concluded that the four strains of galacturonic acid fermenters selected for study yielded identical end products in approximately the same proportions. Per mole of galacturonic acid fermented, about 2 moles of CO(2), 1.5 moles of H(2), 1.5 moles of acetic acid, and 0.25 mole of butyric acid were produced.
TI  - Fermentation of ethylene glycol by Clostridium glycolicum, sp. n.
AB  - Gaston, Lamont W. (National Heart Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and E. R. Stadtman. Fermentation of ethylene glycol by Clostridium glycolicum, sp. n. J. Bacteriol. 85:356-362. 1963.-An anaerobic organism which utilizes ethylene glycol as a source of energy and carbon has been isolated from mud. It is a long (5 mu), slender, motile, gram-positive, spore-forming rod, with peritrichous flagellae. It grows well from 22 to 37 C at pH 7.4 to 7.6, and ferments glucose, fructose, sorbitol, dulcitol, and cellulose. It does not reduce nitrates, form indole, or cause hemolysis or proteolysis except for a slight attack on coagulated egg albumin. Fifteen amino acids and the vitamins biotin and pantothenate are required for optimal growth on ethylene glycol. Analogues other than propylene glycol do not support growth. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are stoichiometrically converted to equal amounts of the respective acid and alcohol.
