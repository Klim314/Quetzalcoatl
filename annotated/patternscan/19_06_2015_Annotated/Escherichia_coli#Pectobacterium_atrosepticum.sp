TI  == penicillin v acylase from pectobacterium atrosepticum exhibits high specific activity and unique kinetics.
AB  == penicillin v acylases (pvas, e.c.3.5.11) belong to the ntn hydrolase super family of enzymes that catalyze the deacylation of the side chain from phenoxymethyl penicillin (penicillin v). penicillin acylases find use in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of semi-synthetic antibiotics. pvas employ the n-terminal cysteine residue as catalytic nucleophile and are structurally and evolutionarily related to bile salt hydrolases (bshs). here, we report the cloning and characterization of a pva enzyme from the gram-negative plant pathogen, pectobacterium atrosepticum (papva). the enzyme was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli attaining a very high yield (250mg/l) and a comparatively high specific activity (430iu/mg). the enzyme showed marginally better ph and thermo-stability over pvas characterized from gram-positive bacteria. the enzyme also showed enhanced activity in presence of organic solvents and detergents. the enzyme kinetics turned out to be significantly different from that of previously reported pvas, displaying positive cooperativity and substrate inhibition. the presence of bile salts had a modulating effect on papva activity. sequence analysis and characterization reveal the distinctive nature of these enzymes and underscore the need to study pvas from gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == deciphering the dual effect of lipopolysaccharides from plant pathogenic pectobacterium.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) are a component of the outer cell surface of almost all gram-negative bacteria and play an essential role for bacterial growth and survival. lipopolysaccharides represent typical microbe-associated molecular pattern (mamp) molecules and have been reported to induce defense-related responses, including the expression of defense genes and the suppression of the hypersensitive response in plants. however, depending on their origin and the challenged plant, lps were shown to have complex and different roles. in this study we showed that lps from plant pathogens pectobacterium atrosepticum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum induce common and different responses in a. thaliana cells when compared to those induced by lps from non-phytopathogens escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among common responses to both types of lps are the transcription of defense genes and their ability to limit of cell death induced by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp carotovorum. however, the differential kinetics and amplitude in reactive oxygen  species (ros) generation seemed to regulate defense gene transcription and be determinant to induce programmed cell death in response to lps from the plant pathogenic pectobacterium. these data suggest that different signaling pathways could be activated by lps in a. thaliana cells.

TI  == a type vi secretion system is involved in pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial competition.
AB  == protein secretion systems are crucial mediators of bacterial interactions with other organisms. among them, the type vi secretion system (t6ss) is widespread in gram-negative bacteria and appears to inject toxins into competitor bacteria and/or eukaryotic cells. major human pathogens, such as vibrio cholerae, burkholderia and pseudomonas aeruginosa, express t6sss. bacteria prevent self-intoxication by their own t6ss toxins by producing immunity proteins, which  interact with the cognate toxins. we describe here an environmental p. fluorescens strain, mfe01, displaying an uncommon oversecretion of hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein) and vgrg (valine-glycine repeat protein g) into the culture medium. these proteins are characteristic components of a functional  t6ss. the aim of this study was to attribute a role to this energy-consuming overexpression of the t6ss. the genome of mfe01 contains at least two hcp genes (hcp1 and hcp2), suggesting that there may be two putative t6ss clusters. phenotypic studies have shown that mfe01 is avirulent against various eukaryotic  cell models (amebas, plant or animal cell models), but has antibacterial activity against a wide range of competitor bacteria, including rhizobacteria and clinical bacteria. depending on the prey cell, mutagenesis of the hcp2 gene in mfe01 abolishes or reduces this antibacterial killing activity. moreover, the introduction of t6ss immunity proteins from s. marcescens, which is not killed by mfe01, protects e. coli against mfe01 killing. these findings suggest that the protein encoded by hcp2 is involved in the killing activity of mfe01 mediated by  effectors of the t6ss targeting the peptidoglycan of gram-negative bacteria. our  results indicate that mfe01 can protect potato tubers against pectobacterium atrosepticum, which causes tuber soft rot. pseudomonas fluorescens is often described as a major pgpr (plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium), and our results suggest that there may be a connection between the t6ss and the pgpr properties of this bacterium.

TI  == group iii alcohol dehydrogenase from pectobacterium atrosepticum: insights into enzymatic activity and organization of the metal ion-containing region.
AB  == nad(p)(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (adh) are widely distributed in all phyla. these proteins can be assigned to three nonhomologous groups of isozymes,  with group iii being highly diverse with regards to catalytic activity and primary structure. members of group iii adhs share a conserved stretch of amino acid residues important for cofactor binding and metal ion coordination, while sequence identities for complete proteins are highly diverse (<20 to >90 %). a putative group iii adh payqhd has been identified in blast analysis from the plant pathogenic enterobacterium pectobacterium atrosepticum. the payqhd gene was expressed in the heterologous host escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein  was purified in a two-step purification procedure to homogeneity indicating an obligate dimerization of monomers. four conserved amino acid residues involved in metal ion coordination were substituted with alanine, and their importance for catalytic activity was confirmed by circular dichroism spectrum determination, in vitro, and growth experiments. payqhd exhibits optimal activity at 40 degrees c with short carbon chain aldehyde compounds and nadph as cofactor indicating the enzyme to be an aldehyde reductase. no oxidative activities towards alcoholic compounds were detectable. edta completely inhibited catalytic activity and was fully restored by the addition of co(2+). activity measurements together with sequence alignments and structure analysis confirmed that payqhd belongs to the butanol dehydrogenase-like enzymes within group iii of adhs.

TI  == the endophytic lifestyle of escherichia coli o157:h7: quantification and internal localization in roots.
AB  == the foodborne pathogen escherichia coli o157:h7 is increasingly associated with fresh produce (fruit and vegetables). bacterial colonization of fresh produce plants can occur to high levels on the external tissue but bacteria have also been detected within plant tissue. however, questions remain about the extent of  internalization, its molecular basis, and internal location of the bacteria. we have determined the extent of internalization of e. coli o157:h7 in live spinach  and lettuce plants and used high-resolution microscopy to examine colony formation in roots and pathways to internalization. e. coli o157:h7 was found within internal tissue of both produce species. colonization occurred within the  apoplast between plant cells. furthermore, colonies were detected inside the cell wall of epidermal and cortical cells of spinach and nicotiana benthamiana roots.  internal colonization of epidermal cells resembled that of the phytopathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum on potato. in contrast, only sporadic cells of the laboratory strain of e. coli k-12 were found on spinach, with no internal bacteria evident. the data extend previous findings that internal colonization of plants appears to be limited to a specific group of plant-interacting bacteria, including e. coli o157:h7, and demonstrates its ability to invade the cells of living plants.

TI  == evolution of the metabolic and regulatory networks associated with oxygen availability in two phytopathogenic enterobacteria.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic  enterobacteria capable of facultative anaerobic growth in a wide range of o2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. the transcriptional response to o2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the o2-responsive stimulon. here we present a comparison of transcriptional  profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, grown to mid-log phase in mops minimal medium (0.1% glucose) with and without o2. results: more than 7% of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3-fold changes under anaerobic conditions. in addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the o2 responsive stimulon includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic stimulon of e. coli. we define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. this conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. other components of  the anaerobic stimulon show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between e. coli and the phytopathogens. surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic stimulon between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. there are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between dickeya and pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type vi secretion system (t6ss), suggesting that fine-tuning of the stimulon impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. conclusions: the  small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising  the conserved core transcriptional response to o2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the enterobacteriaceae. our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each  organism using different genes and regulatory strategies.

TI  == a multi-repeat adhesin of the phytopathogen, pectobacterium atrosepticum, is secreted by a type i pathway and is subject to complex regulation involving a non-canonical diguanylate cyclase.
AB  == cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) is a second messenger controlling many important bacterial processes. the phytopathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 (pba1043) possesses a type i secretion system (t1ss) essential for the secretion  of a proteinaceous multi-repeat adhesin (mrp) required for binding to the host plant. the genes encoding the mrp and the t1ss are tightly linked to genes encoding several putative c-di-gmp regulatory components. we show that c-di-gmp regulates secreted mrp levels in pba1043 through the action of two genes encoding predicted diguanylate cyclase (dgc) and phosphodiesterase proteins (eca3270 and eca3271). phenotypic analyses and quantification of c-di-gmp levels demonstrated  that eca3270 and eca3271 regulate secreted mrp levels by increasing and decreasing, respectively, the intracellular levels of c-di-gmp. moreover, eca3270 represents the first active dgc reported to have an alternative active-site motif from the 'canonical' gg[d/e]ef. eca3270 has an a-site motif of sgdef and analysis of single amino acid replacements demonstrated that the first position of this motif can tolerate functional substitution. serine in position one of the a-site  is also observed in many other dgcs. finally, another t1ss-linked regulator (eca3265) also plays an important role in regulating secreted mrp, with an altered localization of mrp observed in an eca3265 mutant background. mutants defective in these three t1ss-linked regulators exhibit a reduction in root binding and virulence, confirming that this complex, finely tuned regulation system is crucial in the interaction with host plants.

TI  == the r1162 mob proteins can promote conjugative transfer from cryptic origins in the bacterial chromosome.
AB  == the mobilization proteins of the broad-host-range plasmid r1162 can initiate conjugative transfer of a plasmid from a 19-bp locus that is partially degenerate in sequence. such loci are likely to appear by chance in the bacterial chromosome and could act as cryptic sites for transfer of chromosomal dna when r1162 is present. the r1162-dependent transfer of chromosomal dna, initiated from one such potential site in pectobacterium atrosepticum, is shown here. a second active site was identified in escherichia coli, where it is also shown that large amounts of dna are transferred. this transfer probably reflects the combined activity of the multiple cryptic origins in the chromosome. transfer of chromosomal dna due to the presence of a plasmid in the cytoplasm describes a previously unrecognized potential for the exchange of bacterial dna.

TI  == identification of a dna restriction-modification system in pectobacterium carotovorum strains isolated from poland.
AB  == aims: polish isolates of pectinolytic bacteria from the species pectobacterium carotovorum were screened for the presence of a dna restriction-modification (r-m) system. methods and results: eighty-nine strains of p. carotovorum were isolated from infected potato plants. sixty-six strains belonged to p. carotovorum ssp. atrosepticum and 23 to p. carotovorum ssp. carotovorum. the presence of restriction enzyme pca17ai, which is an isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease, was observed in all isolates of p. c. atrosepticum but not in p. c. carotovorum. the biochemical properties, pcr amplification, and sequences of the  pca17ai restriction endonuclease and methyltransferase genes were compared with the prototype ecorii r-m system genes. only when dna isolated from cells of p. c. atrosepticum was used as a template, amplification of a 680 bp homologous to the  gene coding ecorii endonuclease. conclusions: endonuclease pca17ai, having a relatively low temperature optimum, was identified. pcr amplification revealed that the nucleotide sequence of genes for ecorii and pca17ai r-m are different. dcm methylation was observed in all strains of pectobacterium and other erwinia species tested. the sequence of a dna fragment coding dcm methylase in p. carotovorum was different from that of escherichia coli. significance and impact  of the study: pca17ai is the first psychrophilic isoschizomer of ecorii endonuclease. the presence of specific dcm methylation in chromosomal dna isolated from p. carotovorum is described for the first time. a 680 bp pcr product, unique for p. c. atrosepticum strains, could serve as a molecular marker for detection of these bacteria in environmental samples.
