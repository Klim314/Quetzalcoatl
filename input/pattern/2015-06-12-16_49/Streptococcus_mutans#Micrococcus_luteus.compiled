TI  - Protective role of the neuropeptide urocortin II against experimental sepsis and  leishmaniasis by direct killing of pathogens.
AB  - We currently face an alarming resurgence in infectious diseases characterized by  antimicrobial resistance and therapeutic failure. This has generated the urgent need of developing new therapeutic approaches that include agents with nontraditional modes of action. A recent interest focused on approaches based on our natural immune defenses, especially on peptides that combine innate antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens and immunoregulatory functions. In this study, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the neuropeptide urocortin II (UCNII) against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and tropical parasites of the genus Leishmania. Importantly, this cytotoxicity was selective for pathogens, because UCNII did not affect mammalian cell viability. Structurally, UCNII has a cationic and amphipathic design that resembles antimicrobial peptides. Using mutants and UCNII fragments, we determined the structural requirements for the interaction between the peptide and the surface of pathogen. Following its binding to pathogen, UCNII caused cell death through different membrane-disrupting mechanisms that involve aggregation and membrane depolarization in bacteria and pore formation in Leishmania. Noteworthily, UCNII killed the infective form of Leishmania major even inside the infected macrophages. Consequently, UCNII prevented mortality caused by polymicrobial sepsis and ameliorated pathological signs of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Besides its presence in body physical and mucosal barriers, we found that innate immune cells produce UCNII in response to infections. Therefore, UCNII could be considered as an ancient highly-conserved host peptide involved in the natural antimicrobial defense and emerge as an attractive alternative to current treatments for microbial disorders with associated drug resistances.
TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of the Alkaloid-Enriched Extract from Prosopis juliflora Pods and Its Influence on in Vitro Ruminal Digestion.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of alkaloid-enriched extracts from Prosopis juliflora (Fabaceae) pods in order to evaluate them as feed additives for ruminants. As only the basic chloroformic extract (BCE), whose main constituents were juliprosopine (juliflorine), prosoflorine and juliprosine, showed Gram-positive antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus (MIC = 25 mug/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 50 mug/mL) and Streptococcus mutans (MIC = 50 mug/mL), its influence on ruminal digestion was evaluated using a semi-automated in vitro gas production technique, with monensin as the positive control. Results showed that BCE has decreased gas production as efficiently as monensin after 36 h of fermentation, revealing its positive influence on gas production during ruminal digestion. Since P. juliflora is a very affordable plant, this study points out this alkaloid enriched extract from the pods of Prosopis juliflora as a potential feed additive to decrease gas production during ruminal digestion.
TI  - Phenolic Content, Antioxidant Activity, Antibacterial Activity and Phytochemical  Composition of Garcinia lancifolia.
AB  - Garcinia lancifolia (Clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. The acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. The phytochemical analysis of different extracts of G. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. The high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. The G. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis. The methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against Gram-positive bacteria when compared with Gram-negative bacteria. The radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. All extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.
TI  - pH and Antimicrobial Activity of Portland Cement Associated with Different Radiopacifying Agents.
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and pH changes induced by Portland cement (PC) alone and in association with radiopacifiers. Methods. The materials tested were pure PC, PC + bismuth oxide, PC + zirconium oxide, PC + calcium tungstate, and zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar diffusion test using the following strains: Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, inhibition of bacterial growth was observed and measured. For pH analysis, material samples (n = 10) were placed in polyethylene tubes and immersed in 10 mL of distilled water. After 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, the pH of the solutions was determined using a pH meter. Results. All microbial species were inhibited by the cements evaluated. All materials composed of PC with radiopacifying agents promoted pH increase similar to pure Portland cement. ZOE had the lowest pH values throughout all experimental periods. Conclusions. All Portland cement-based materials with the addition of different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide) presented antimicrobial activity and pH similar to pure Portland cement.
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation on Clusia burlemarxii (Clusiaceae) led to isolation and identification of nine compounds. Were isolated from leaves 3-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosylquercetin, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylkaempferol, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyldihydrofuran-2-one, 2Z-delta-tocotrienoloic acid and friedelin and were isolated from trunk betulinic acid, protocatechuic acid, lyoniresinol, and a new biphenyl 2,2-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromane. The structures were determined by (1)H, (1)(3)C-NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HMQC, HRESIMS. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger and Cladosporium cladosporioides was also determined. Extracts and compounds showed significant activity against tested Gram-positive bacteria, none activity against tested Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. METHODS: The sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). All subjects underwent rapid maxillary expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. Two 10-mL blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. All blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and API kits (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). RESULTS: Overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. The data were analyzed with the Fisher exact test. No statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Improved methods for mutacin detection and production.
AB  - Studies of mutacins have always been hampered by the difficulties in obtaining active liquid preparations of these substances. In order to be commercially produced, good mutacin yields have to be obtained, preferably in inexpensive media. The results presented here indicate that mutacins can be produced in supplemented cheese whey permeate. The influence of carbon and nitrogen supplements on mutacin production varied according to the producer strain. The use of CaCO3 as a buffer in batch cultures resulted in improved yields of mutacin in the supernatants. Antimicrobial activity assays were improve by acidification of the diluent (pH 2) and were less variable in peptone water (0.5%). The culture medium consisting of cheese whey permeate (6% w/v), yeast extract (2% w/v) and CaCO3 (1% w/v) was found to be an inexpensive medium for the efficient production of mutacins.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - In vivo antimicrobial activity of 2% chlorhexidine used as a root canal irrigating solution.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo antimicrobial activity of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (FCFRP-USP) used as a root canal irrigating solution in teeth with pulp necrosis and radiographically visible chronic periapical reactions. Culture techniques and measurement of the inhibition zone were used. Twenty-two root canals of incisors and molars of 12 patients were used. After accessing the canal, the first root canal sample was collected with two sterile paper points that were transferred to a tube containing reduced transport fluid. The root canal was instrumented using chlorhexidine solution. A small sterile cotton pellet was placed at the root canal entrance, and the cavity was sealed with zinc oxide-eugenol cement. The canals were maintained empty for 48 h. Three sterile paper points were then introduced to absorb the root canal fluid (second sample). One paper point was placed on an agar plate inoculated with Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, and the other two were submitted to microbiological evaluation. Present in 10 cases at baseline, mutans streptococci was reduced by 100% at the second assessment. Treatment showed an efficiency of 77.78% for anaerobic microorganisms at the second assessment. These data suggest that chlorhexidine prevents microbial activity in vivo with residual effects in the root canal system up to 48 h.
