TI  - Phylogenetic reconstruction of Gram-positive organisms based on comparative sequence analysis of molecular chaperones from the ruminal microorganism Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1.
AB  - Primers designed on the basis of nucleotide sequences conserved in DnaK and GroEL from Gram-positive organisms were used to PCR amplify internal regions of the cognate genes from the anaerobic ruminal cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1. Genome walking was then utilized to elucidate the remainder of the sequences in addition to upstream and downstream regions. The full sequence of the gene encoding the GroES protein (groES) was found directly upstream from groEL. The deduced amino acid sequence of the groEL gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum GroEL protein (72% amino acid identity). Similarly, translation of the groES nucleotide sequence showed highest homology to the C. thermocellum GroES protein (61% amino acid identity). Analysis of the upstream region of this chaperonin operon revealed a CIRCE regulatory element 45 bp upstream from the putative start of the groES ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative dnaK gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the Clostridium acetobutylicum DnaK protein (68% amino acid identity). Phylogenetic analyses based on the translated sequences reiterate this relationship between R. flavefaciens and the Clostridia. However, when the nucleotide sequences of Gram-positive organisms are analyzed, a different topology occurs of the relationship between high- and low-G+C Gram-positive organisms to the 16S rRNA interpretation.
TI  - The xynC gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 codes for a xylanase with two similar catalytic domains.
AB  - The xynC gene of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 codes for a 66.4-kDa xylanase which consists of three distinct domains separated by two flexible regions rich in serine residues. Domains A and B of XynC code for catalytic domains with 56.5% identity and 9.6% similarity with each other, and both domains share homology with xylanases of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Neocallimastix patriciarum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus circulans. More than 88% of the xylanase activity of Escherichia coli cells carrying the original 13-kb recombinant plasmid was released from intact cells by cold water washes. The major products of hydrolysis of xylan by both domains were xylose and xylobiose, indicating that the xynC gene product exhibits catalytic properties similar to those of the XynA xylanases from R. flavefaciens and N. patriciarum. So far, these features are not shared broadly with bacteria from other environments and may indicate specific selection for this domain structure in the highly competitive environment of the rumen.
