TI  == differential activation of eosinophils by bacteria associated with asthma.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that there is a complex interaction between microbiota and various human diseases. some bacteria have been reported to be involved in the inception and progression of asthma, and others in the protection against asthma. we know very little about the mechanisms by which bacteria do harm or good with regard to asthma. this study investigated whether bacteria exert differential effects on the functions of eosinophils, major effector cells  in airway inflammation in asthma. methods: eosinophils were purified from healthy adult volunteers by percoll density gradient centrifugation and negative immunomagnetic bead selection using anti-cd16 microbeads. three kinds of heat-killed bacteria that have been implicated in asthma, namely staphylococcus aureus (sa), haemophilus influenzae (hi) and a prevotella sp. (ps), were tested for their effects on the secretion of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn), the generation of superoxides and the production of cytokines/chemokines. results: sa, but not hi or ps, induced significant edn release in a dose-dependent manner. superoxide generation was significantly enhanced by each of the bacterial species, but most strongly by sa, which induced significantly greater tnf-alpha production by eosinophils than either hi or ps. conversely, interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was more strongly induced by hi and ps than by sa. conclusions: bacteria exert differential effects on eosinophils. based on these results, sa may be involved in the exacerbation of, and hi and ps in the inhibition of, eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.

TI  == causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and severity in a contemporary series of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == objective: to identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with fournier's gangrene. materials and methods: the medical records of  41 consecutive cases of fournier's gangrene were evaluated. the patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. the fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. results: a total of 122 pathogens were cultured. the wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). most common pathogens cultured were bacteroides sp (43.9%), escherichia coli (36.6%), and prevotella sp (34.1%). e coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. the wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). a monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in providencia sp, klebsiella sp, e coli, and methicillin-resistant s aureus. resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant s aureus and e coli, respectively. no resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. no statistically significant difference was detected between the fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. conclusion: fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. candida and methicillin-resistant s aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but  methicillin-resistant s aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
AB  == the present study was conducted on 50 recently calved iraqi buffalo cows. depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (np) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (ppc) (24 animals). after 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (nrp) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (rp). sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. in ppc group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus. total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with rp in ppc group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. among the isolates, archanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenicus and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after  48 h of rp buffaloes in ppc group. polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with rp in both ppc and np groups. in conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. the presence of lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of e. coli in the uterine lumen might favour  the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by ca(oh)2 mixed with sterile water and by chx gel alone. two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. however, 2% chx gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. a paste of ca(oh)2 plus sterile water  inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. in conclusion, 2% chx gel + ca(oh)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than ca(oh)2 manipulated with sterile water.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide combined with different vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. for such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. pastes were prepared with ca(oh)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (cmcp), cmcp + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and cmcp + polyethyleneglycol. the time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the kruskal wallis test at 5% significance level. timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). in conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. these findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx gel and chx liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%,  2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). a broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and  statistically analyzed. both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. all tested irrigants eliminated porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. the timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% chx liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% naocl. the antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of  the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  == chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to  assess the diversity of the flora present. washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to pcr amplification of bacterial 16s rdna using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. the samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16s rdna were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). three sinus samples were positive by both pcr and culture methods, one was positive only by pcr, and one only by culture. thirteen bacterial species were identified: abiotrophia defectiva, enterococcus avium, eubacterium sp., granulicatella elegans, neisseria sp., prevotella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sp. fungi were not detected. in one  patient streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis, and in another patient pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific pcr primers. these results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis  cases.

TI  == the microbiology of mucopyocele.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of mucopyocele. study design: retrospective review of clinical and microbiologic records of patients with mucopyocele between june 1982 and september 1997. methods: aspirates of 36 mucopyocele were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: one hundred six bacterial isolates, 42 aerobic and facultatives and 64 anaerobic, were recovered. the predominant aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (6), hemophilus spp. (5), and gram-negative bacilli (6). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp.  (22), prevotella sp. (15), fusobacterium sp. (5), and propionibacterium acnes(5). thirty-three beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 23 patients. conclusions: these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of mucopyocele.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

AB  == the microbiology of needle aspirates from 40 inflamed cervical lymph glands was studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. forty-two bacterial, 11 mycobacterial and six fungal isolates were isolated. aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 11 (27.5%), anaerobes alone in five (12.5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven (17.5%). mycobacterium sp. were recovered in 11 (27.5%) and fungi in six (15%). the recovery of anaerobes was associated with dental infection. eighteen aerobic bacteria were isolated and the predominant ones were staphylococcus aureus (eight isolates) and group a streptococci (four). twenty-four anaerobic bacteria were recovered and the predominant ones were: prevotella sp. (six), peptostreptococcus sp. (five), propionibacterium acnes (four) and fusobacterium sp. (three). these findings demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material from the glands for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == in-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  == one hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. all isolates, except rothia spp. (one), enterococcus avium (three), haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of prevotella, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides and porphyromonas. all the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. a potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the mics of  spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of eubacterium, two of  lactobacilli, one strain of peptostreptococcus sp. and one clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.

AB  == study objectives: establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children. method: retrospective review of specimens obtained from 14 children with bacterial tracheitis that were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: a total 30 bacterial isolates were recovered, 17 aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 13 anaerobic. aerobic bacteria only were present in six (43%) specimens, anaerobes only in three (21%), and mixed aerobic  and anaerobic flora in five (36%). polymicrobial flora was recovered in 10 of the 14 specimens. the predominant organisms were staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates),  haemophilus influenzae type b (4), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (4), fusobacterium sp. (2), and moraxella catarrhalis (2). two organisms that were also isolated from the tracheal aspirates were recovered from the blood of two patients (one each of h. influenzae and prevotella intermedia). eleven beta-lactamase-producing organisms  were isolated from nine patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus and m. catarrhalis, and two each of h. influenzae and prevotella sp. conclusions: these  data confirm the predominance of s. aureus and h. influenzae in causing bacterial tracheitis in children and suggest a potential role for anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. materials and methods: the current literature is reviewed. review: sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. aureus, fusobacterium sp., and prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (s. pneumoniae). the pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to  cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. conclusions: the indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. the direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections. proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == the role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
