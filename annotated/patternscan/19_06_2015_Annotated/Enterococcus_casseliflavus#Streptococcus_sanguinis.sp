TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
