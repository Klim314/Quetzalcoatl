TI  == functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == we demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). incubation with escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (cela) fused with a dockerin domain from c. thermocellum (at), an exoglucanase (cele) from c. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the  same species (ec), and an endoglucanase (celg) from c. cellulolyticum fused with  a dockerin domain from r. flavefaciens (gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. the displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. when a  beta-glucosidase (bgla) from c. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from r. flavefaciens was used in place of gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. the final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. the overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. this result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.

TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.

TI  == unconventional mode of attachment of the ruminococcus flavefaciens cellulosome to the cell surface.
AB  == sequence extension of the scaffoldin gene cluster from ruminococcus flavefaciens  revealed a new gene (scae) that encodes a protein with an n-terminal cohesin domain and a c terminus with a typical gram-positive anchoring signal for sortase-mediated attachment to the bacterial cell wall. the recombinant cohesin of scae was recovered after expression in escherichia coli and was shown to bind  to the c-terminal domain of the cellulosomal structural protein scab, as well as  to three unknown polypeptides derived from native cellulose-bound ruminococcus flavefaciens protein extracts. the scab c terminus includes a cryptic dockerin domain that is unusual in its sequence, and considerably larger than conventional dockerins. the scab dockerin binds to scae, suggesting that this interaction occurs through a novel cohesin-dockerin pairing. the novel scab dockerin was expressed as a xylanase fusion protein, which was shown to bind tenaciously and selectively to a recombinant form of the scae cohesin. thus, scae appears to play a role in anchoring the cellulosomal complex to the bacterial cell envelope via its interaction with scab. this sortase-mediated mechanism for covalent cell-wall anchoring of the cellulosome in r. flavefaciens differs from those reported thus  far for any other cellulosome system.

TI  == molecular study on cloned endoglucanase gene from rumen bacterium.
AB  == an endoglucanase gene was subcloned from anaerobic rumen bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens strain 17. to express endoglucanase gene in escherichia coli and streptococcus bovis jb1, an endoglucanase gene fragment was inserted into pva838-based shuttle vectors. removal of endoglucanase gene promoter and expression of endoglucanase by promoter of s. bovis jb1 alpha-amylase gene (pacmcs) was also achieved. survival of constructs pvacmci, ptacmc and pacmcs, which carry endoglucanase gene, and stability of endoglucanase gene in s. bovis jb1, were observed. maximal endoglucanase activities from s. bovis jb1/pvacmci were 2- to 3-fold higher than from e. coli/pvacmci. specific cell activity of e.  coli/pacmcs was found to be approximately 2- to -3 fold higher than the both e. coli/pvacmci and e. coli/ptacmc. specific cell activity of s. bovis jb1/pacmcs was also found to be approximately 2-fold higher than the both s. bovis/pvacmci and s. bovis jb1/ptacmc.

TI  == scac, an adaptor protein carrying a novel cohesin that expands the dockerin-binding repertoire of the ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 cellulosome.
AB  == a new gene, designated scac and encoding a protein carrying a single cohesin, was identified in the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 as part of a gene cluster that also codes for the cellulosome structural components  scaa and scab. phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequence of the scac cohesin is distinct from the sequences of other cohesins, including the sequences of r. flavefaciens scaa and scab. the scac gene product also includes at its c terminus a dockerin module that closely resembles those found in r. flavefaciens enzymes that bind to the cohesins of the primary scaa scaffoldin. the putative cohesin domain and the c-terminal dockerin module were cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli as his(6)-tagged products (scac-coh and scac-doc, respectively). affinity probing of protein extracts of r. flavefaciens 17 separated in one-dimensional and two-dimensional gels with recombinant cohesins from scac and  scaa revealed that two distinct subsets of native proteins interact with scac-coh and scaa-coh. furthermore, scac-coh failed to interact with the recombinant dockerin module from the enzyme endb that is recognized by scaa cohesins. on the  other hand, scac-doc was shown to interact specifically with the recombinant cohesin domain from scaa, and the scaa-coh probe was shown to interact with a native 29-kda protein spot identified as scac by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. these results suggest that scac plays the role of an adaptor scaffoldin that is bound to scaa via the scac dockerin module, which, via the distinctive scac cohesin, expands the range of proteins that can bind to the scaa-based enzyme complex.

TI  == endb, a multidomain family 44 cellulase from ruminococcus flavefaciens 17, binds  to cellulose via a novel cellulose-binding module and to another r. flavefaciens  protein via a dockerin domain.
AB  == the mechanisms by which cellulolytic enzymes and enzyme complexes in ruminococcus spp. bind to cellulose are not fully understood. the product of the newly isolated cellulase gene endb from ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 was purified as a  his-tagged product after expression in escherichia coli and found to be able to bind directly to crystalline cellulose. the ability to bind cellulose is shown to be associated with a novel cellulose-binding module (cbm) located within a region of 200 amino acids that is unrelated to known protein sequences. endb (808 amino  acids) also contains a catalytic domain belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 44 and a c-terminal dockerin-like domain. purified endb is also shown to bind specifically via its dockerin domain to a polypeptide of ca. 130 kda present among supernatant proteins from avicel-grown r. flavefaciens that attach to cellulose. the protein to which endb attaches is a strong candidate for the scaffolding component of a cellulosome-like multienzyme complex recently identified in this species (s.-y. ding et al., j. bacteriol. 183:1945-1953, 2001). it is concluded that binding of endb to cellulose may occur both through its own cbm and potentially also through its involvement in a cellulosome complex.

TI  == cellulosomal scaffoldin-like proteins from ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == two tandem cellulosome-associated genes were identified in the cellulolytic rumen bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens. the deduced gene products represent multimodular scaffoldin-related proteins (termed scaa and scab), both of which include several copies of explicit cellulosome signature sequences. the scab gene was completely sequenced, and its upstream neighbor scaa was partially sequenced. the sequenced portion of scaa contains repeating cohesin modules and a c-terminal dockerin domain. scab contains seven relatively divergent cohesin modules, two extremely long t-rich linkers, and a c-terminal domain of unknown function. collectively, the cohesins of scaa and scab are phylogenetically distinct from the previously described type i and type ii cohesins, and we propose that they define a new group, which we designated here type iii cohesins. selected modules  from both genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were used as probes in affinity-blotting experiments. the results strongly indicate that scaa serves as a cellulosomal scaffoldin-like protein for  several r. flavefaciens enzymes. the data are supported by the direct interaction of a recombinant scaa cohesin with an expressed dockerin-containing enzyme construct from the same bacterium. the evidence also demonstrates that the scaa dockerin binds to a specialized cohesin(s) on scab, suggesting that scab may act  as an anchoring protein, linked either directly or indirectly to the bacterial cell surface. this study is the first direct demonstration in a cellulolytic rumen bacterium of a cellulosome system, mediated by distinctive cohesin-dockerin interactions.

TI  == a cysteine desulphurase gene from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == a gene whose predicted product shows 40-50% sequence identity with the products of nifs genes from nitrogen-fixing bacteria was found downstream from a cellulase gene in a dna fragment from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe, ruminococcus flavefaciens 17. the r. flavefaciens gene product released sulphur from l-cysteine when expressed in escherichia coli, indicating that the r. flavefaciens nifs enzyme may play a role in sulphuration, perhaps, as in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, supplying sulphur to fes proteins. sequences hybridising with the r. flavefaciens 17 nifs-like gene were also detected in r. flavefaciens 007 and in r. albus sy3.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid, pbaw301, from the ruminal anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens r13e2.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid designated pbaw301, from the gram-positive ruminal bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens r13e2, has been determined. this plasmid is 1768 bp in size and has an overall g+c content of 43.5%. computer analysis of the sequence data revealed an open reading frame, orf1 (256 amino acids), which is similar to the rep protein of the bacillus borstelensis plasmid pht926. orf1 is preceded by shine-dalgarno and escherichia coli-10 and -35 like sequences. nine smaller open reading frames showed no significant homologies to known protein sequences. analysis of replication intermediates and the nucleotide sequence indicate that the plasmid does not replicate by a rolling-circle mode of replication similar to other plasmids from  gram-positive bacteria. moreover, sequences typical of theta replication origins  were not found in the nucleotide sequence of pbaw301. these data suggest that this plasmid either replicates by an as yet undescribed mechanism, or represents  a new class of theta replicating plasmids.

TI  == dna sequence and transcriptional characterization of a beta-glucanase gene (celb) from ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1.
AB  == the recombinant clone pbaw101 (in pbluescript sk-) contains the celb endoglucanase gene from ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1. subcloning indicated that the endoglucanase activity expressed was present within a 2.4-kb insert (pbaw104). the nucleotide sequence of the celb gene was determined, and upon analysis, revealed an open reading frame of 1943 nucleotides that encodes a polypeptide of 632 amino acids with a molecular weight of 69,414. a putative shine-dalgarno sequence was identified 6 bp upstream from the translation start site. the n-terminal 32 amino acid residues were typical of prokaryotic signal sequences. hydrophobic cluster analysis (hca) and dna alignment of celb to other  published beta-glucanase polypeptide sequences in genbank indicate that celb belongs in hca cellulase family 44. primer extension analyses were performed using rna isolated from r. flavefaciens grown on cellulose and cellobiose, and from escherichia coli containing the plasmid clone pbaw104. transcription is initiated at different sites in e. coli and r. flavefaciens. in the case of r. flavefaciens transcription is initiated at a c residue (nucleotides 329), 221 bp  upstream from the translation start site. there were no regions resembling e. coli sigma 70-like promoter sequences present upstream from this putative transcription initiation site. in contrast, numerous transcription initiation sites were identified when rna from e. coli was used in the primer extension analyses.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and transcriptional analysis of the celd beta-glucanase gene  from ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the celd gene, which encodes endoglucanase and xylanase activity, from ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1 was determined. the dna sequence of celd contains an open reading frame of 1215 nucleotides that encodes  a polypeptide of 405 amino acids with a molecular mass of 44,631 da. the primary  amino acid sequence of celd was screened against the genbank data base for similar polypeptide sequences and the analysis indicated that celd has common features with endoglucanases from the family e cellulases. both hydrophobic cluster and bestfit (genetics computer group (university of wisconsin) package) analyses confirmed this relationship. pairwise alignments using bestfit revealed  that celd was most closely related to ende4 from thermomonospora fusca over a 160 amino acid window. the histidine, aspartate, and glutamate residues identified as being essential for catalytic activity in family e cellulases are conserved in celd. a shine-dalgarno-like sequence was present 5 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation start site. primer extension analysis indicated that different transcription initiation sites are used to initiate transcription of celd in escherichia coli and r. flavefaciens. in the case of r. flavefaciens the transcription initiation site is at a t residue (nucleotide 273) 16 bp upstream from the translational start site. a region resembling a sigma 70-like-10 promoter sequence is present upstream from the transcription initiation site but  there is no apparent-35 region. in contrast, transcription in e. coli is initiated at a c residue 258 bp upstream from the translational start site and a  sequence resembling a omega 70-like-10 region is present 5 bp upstream of this residue.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identification of non-catalytic conserved regions in xylanases encoded by the xynb and xynd genes of the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == xynb is one of at least four genes from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 that encode xylanase activity. the xynb gene is predicted to encode a 781-amino acid product starting with a signal peptide, followed by an amino-terminal xylanase domain which is identical at 89% and 78% of residues, respectively, to the amino-terminal xylanase domains of the bifunctional xynd and xyna enzymes from the same organism. two separate regions within the carboxy-terminal 537 amino acids of xynb also show close similarities  with domain b of xynd. these regions show no significant homology with cellulose- or xylan-binding domains from other species, or with any other sequences, and their functions are unknown. in addition a 30 to 32-residue threonine-rich region is present in both xynd and xynb. codon usage shows a consistent pattern of bias  in the three xylanase genes from r. flavefaciens that have been sequenced.

TI  == features of the cellodextrinase gene from fibrobacter succinogenes s85.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb dna fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (ceda) from the ruminal anaerobe fibrobacter succinogenes s85 was determined. activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both  orientations in pbluescript ks+ and sk-, indicating a functional f. succinogenes  promoter in escherichia coli. promoter sequences (ttgaaca and aataa) were identified upstream of the atg initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. the ceda open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kda, similar to  the 40-kda size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. ceda is proposed to belong to family 5 (family a) of the glycosyl hydrolases. the primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from f. succinogenes s85. short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase c from clostridium thermocellum, cela from ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.

TI  == the xync gene from fibrobacter succinogenes s85 codes for a xylanase with two similar catalytic domains.
AB  == the xync gene of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 codes for a 66.4-kda xylanase which consists of three distinct domains separated by two flexible regions rich in serine residues. domains a and b of xync code for catalytic domains with 56.5% identity and 9.6% similarity with each other, and both domains share homology with xylanases of ruminococcus flavefaciens, neocallimastix patriciarum, clostridium acetobutylicum, bacillus pumilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus circulans. more than 88% of the xylanase activity of escherichia coli cells carrying the original 13-kb recombinant plasmid was released from intact cells by cold water washes. the major products of hydrolysis of xylan by both domains were xylose and xylobiose, indicating that the xync gene product exhibits catalytic properties similar to those of the xyna xylanases from r. flavefaciens and n. patriciarum. so far, these features are not shared broadly with bacteria from other environments and may indicate specific selection for this domain structure  in the highly competitive environment of the rumen.

TI  == mode of action, kinetic properties and physicochemical characterization of two different domains of a bifunctional (1-->4)-beta-d-xylanase from ruminococcus flavefaciens expressed separately in escherichia coli.
AB  == two catalytic domains, a and c, of xylanase a (xyla) from ruminococcus flavefaciens were expressed separately as truncated gene products from lacz fusions in escherichia coli. the fusion products, referred to respectively as xyla-a1 and xyla-c2, were purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing. xyla-a1 was isoelectric at ph 5.0 and had a  molecular mass of 30 kda, whereas xyla-c2 had a pi of 5.4 and a molecular mass of 44 kda. the catalytic activity shown by both domains was optimal at 50 degrees c, but xyla-a1 was more sensitive than xyla-c2 to temperatures higher than the optimum. xyla-a1 showed a higher sensitivity to ph than xyla-c2. the enzyme activity of both domains was completely inactivated in the presence of copper or  silver ions and partially inactivated by iron or zinc ions. neither domain was active on xylo-oligosaccharides shorter than xylopentaose: the rate of degradation of longer xylo-oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization 5-10) increased as the chain length increased. analysis of the products of hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides and xylan (arabinoxylan) polysaccharide showed that the  two domains differed in their modes of action: xylobiose was the shortest product of the hydrolysis. with oat spelt xylan as substrate, xyla-a1 activity was apparently restricted to regions where xylopyranosyl residues did not carry arabinofuranosyl substituents, whereas xyla-c2 was able to release hetero-oligosaccharides carrying arabinofuranosyl residues. neither domain was able to release arabinose from oat spelt xylan.

TI  == a bifunctional enzyme, with separate xylanase and beta(1,3-1,4)-glucanase domains, encoded by the xynd gene of ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == adjacent regions of a ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 dna fragment were found to encode xylanase and beta(1,3-1,4)-glucanase activities. sequencing of this fragment showed that both activities are encoded by a single 2,406-bp open reading frame corresponding to the xynd gene. the predicted product has a characteristic signal sequence that is followed by an amino-terminal domain related to family g xylanases, while the carboxyterminal domain is related to beta(1,3-1,4)-glucanases from several other bacterial species. these two domains  are connected by a region of unknown function that consists of 309 amino acids and includes a 30-amino-acid threonine-rich sequence. a polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 90,000 and exhibiting xylanase and beta(1,3-1,4)-glucanase activities was detected in escherichia coli cells carrying the cloned xynd gene. this is one of the first cases in which a microbial polysaccharidase has been shown to carry separate catalytic domains active against different plant cell wall polysaccharides within the same polypeptide. xynd is one of a family of related genes in r. flavefaciens that encode enzymes having multiple catalytic domains, and the amino terminus of xyld  exhibits a high degree of similarity with the corresponding regions of another xylanase, xyla, which carries two different xylanase catalytic domains.

AB  == glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) (l-glutamate:nadp+ oxidoreductase, deaminating, ec  1.4.1.4) from the cellulolytic ruminal bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens has been purified and characterized. the native enzyme and subunit are 280 and 48 kda, respectively, suggesting that the native enzyme is a hexamer. the enzyme requires 0.5 m kcl for optimal activity and has a ph optimum of 6.9 to 7.0. the kms for ammonia, alpha-ketoglutarate, and glutamate are 19, 0.41, and 62 mm, respectively. the sigmoidal nadph saturation curve revealed positive cooperativity for the binding of this coenzyme. the first residue in the n-terminal amino acid sequence from r. flavefaciens gdh was alanine, suggesting that the protein may be modified posttranslationally. comparison of the n-terminal sequence with those of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium symbiosum revealed only 39% amino acid homologies. the gdh from r. flavefaciens was unique in that its specific activity was highest during ammonia-limited growth but was not affected by ammonia shock treatment (20 mm).

TI  == homologous catalytic domains in a rumen fungal xylanase: evidence for gene duplication and prokaryotic origin.
AB  == a cdna (xyna), encoding xylanase a (xyla), was isolated from a cdna library, derived from mrna extracted from the rumen anaerobic fungus, neocallimastix patriciarum. recombinant xyla, purified from escherichia coli harbouring xyna, had a m(r) of 53,000 and hydrolysed oat-spelt xylan to xylobiose and xylose. the  enzyme did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. the nucleotide sequence of xyna revealed a single open reading frame of 1821 bp coding for a protein of m(r) 66,192. the predicted primary structure of xyla comprised an n-terminal signal peptide followed by a 225-amino-acid repeated sequence, which was separated from  a tandem 40-residue c-terminal repeat by a threonine/proline linker sequence. the large n-terminal reiterated regions consisted of distinct catalytic domains which displayed similar substrate specificities to the full-length enzyme. the reiterated structure of xyla suggests that the enzyme was derived from an ancestral gene which underwent two discrete duplications. sequence comparison analysis revealed significant homology between xyla and bacterial xylanases belonging to cellulase/xylanase family g. one of these homologous enzymes is derived from the rumen bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens. the homology observed between xyla and a rumen prokaryote xylanase could be a consequence of the horizontal transfer of genes between rumen prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, either when the organisms were resident in the rumen, or prior to their colonization of the ruminant. it should also be noted that neocallimastix xyla is the first example of a xylanase which consists of reiterated sequences. it remains to be established whether this is a common phenomenon in other rumen fungal plant cell wall hydrolases.

TI  == a bifunctional xylanase encoded by the xyna gene of the rumen cellulolytic bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 comprises two dissimilar domains linked by an asparagine/glutamine-rich sequence.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the xyna gene of ruminococcus flavefaciens 17 was determined and found to consist of a 2862bp open reading frame beginning with a ttg start codon. the predicted product, xyla, consisted of distinct amino-terminal (a) and carboxy terminal (c) domains (248 amino acids, including a putative signal sequence, and 332 amino acids, respectively) linked by a repetitive sequence (b, 374 amino acids) extraordinarily rich in asparagine (45%) and glutamine (26%) residues. domains a and c were shown to be capable of expressing xylanase activity independently of each other when suitably truncated  derivatives of the xyna coding region were expressed as lacz fusions. the activities associated with the two domains were shown to differ with respect to the average size of hydrolysis products formed from oat-spelt xylan, with domain  c releasing relatively more xylose and domain a more xylo-oligosaccharides. the amino acid sequence of domain a of xyla closely resembled that of the bacillus pumilus xyna enzyme (45% identical residues). on the other hand domain c showed significant similarity (33% to 40% identical residues) to a different group of bacterial xylanases and exoglucanases exemplified by the caldocellum saccharolyticum xyna and celb products. the xyna product is, therefore, a bifunctional enzyme having two dissimilar catalytic domains capable of acting on  xylan.

AB  == h2 production from glucose by ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) m molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. the results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form h2 are used to reduce co2 to formate. growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) m. reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of h2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) m molybdate. h2 production by r. bromei but not by r. flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, veillonella alcalescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.

TI  == importance of the isovalerate carboxylation pathway of leucine biosynthesis in the rumen.
AB  == certain anaerobic ruminal bacteria synthesize the leucine carbon skeleton by use  of a pathway different from that described in other microorganisms. these organisms carboxylate the intact carbon skeleton of isovalerate, synthesizing leucine-2-c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14). strains of bacteroides ruminicola and peptostreptococcus elsdenii were like ruminococcus flavefaciens in that they incorporated appreciable amounts of c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14) into cellular  protein and in that the only labeled amino acid found was leucine. the specific activity of beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase in extracts from r. flavefaciens and from the mixed bacterial population from the rumen was very low as compared with the specific activity of this enzyme in extracts from escherichia coli. this suggests that the pathway of leucine biosynthesis that operates in many aerobic and facultative microorganisms is not the major pathway in rumen bacteria. this was supported by the finding that after fermentation of whole rumen contents with acetate-2-c(14), leucine from the bacterial cells had a specific activity lower than one would expect if acetate was incorporated directly into carbons 1 and 2 of leucine.

TI  == studies on the metabolic function of branched-chain volatile fatty acids, growth  factors for ruminococci. i. incorporation of isovalerate into leucine.
AB  == allison, milton j. (dairy cattle research branch, u. s. department of agriculture, beltsville, md.), m. p. bryant, and r. n. doetsch. studies on the metabolic function of branched-chain volatile fatty acids, growth factors for ruminococci. i. incorporation of isovalerate into leucine. j. bacteriol. 83:523-532. 1962.-ruminococcus flavefaciens strain c94, a cellulolytic rumen bacterium, requires either isobutyrate or isovalerate for growth. the organism was grown in the presence of c(14)-labeled isovalerate, and the metabolic fate of the labeled carbon was studied to obtain information on the functions of this growth factor. radioactivity from isovalerate-1-c(14) and isovalerate-3-c(14) was found mainly in the protein and lipid fractions of the cells. the c(14) in protein was all in leucine, indicating that a function of isovalerate was to serve as a carbon skeleton for leucine synthesis. as c(14) in leucine synthesized from isovalerate-1-c(14) was entirely in carbon 2, the intact isovalerate molecule was apparently incorporated into leucine. this is evidence that leucine  was synthesized by a mechanism different from that previously demonstrated in other microorganisms.r. flavefaciens has a definite but limited ability to incorporate exogenous amino acids, including leucine. it incorporated 2% of the c(14) during growth in uniformly labeled (ul) c(14)-chlorella protein hydrolyzate; escherichia coli incorporated 37% of the label under similar conditions. in another experiment, a limited amount of exogenous leucine-2-c(14)  was incorporated into protein of r. flavefaciens. the requirement for isovalerate was not replaced by dl-leucine or 2-ketoisocaproate. it is suggested that isovalerate or isobutyrate is required because r. flavefaciens has a limited ability to incorporate exogenous branched-chain amino acids and a limited ability to synthesize the isopropyl group found in these amino acids and in other components of the cell.
