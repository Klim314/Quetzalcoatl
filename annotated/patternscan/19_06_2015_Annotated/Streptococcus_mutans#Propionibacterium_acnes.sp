TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == viability reagent, prestoblue, in comparison with other available reagents, utilized in cytotoxicity and antimicrobial assays.
AB  == this study compared different commercially available viability reagents. the growth indicator reagents include p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (int), prestoblue, and alamar blue which were used for antimicrobial analysis against streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium acnes, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. prestoblue and alamar blue are resazurin based reagents that resulted in a quick and easily distinguishable colour change that allowed for visual readings. int and sodium 3'-[1-(phenyl amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis-[4-methoxy-6-nitro] benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (xtt) are tetrazolium based reagents which are converted to a formazan dye in the presence of metabolically active mitochondria enzyme. for cell viability analysis, reagents xtt and prestoblue were compared. prestoblue was able to clearly indicate the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of various positive drug controls on various microbial strains. prestoblue was also a good indicator of the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of positive drug controls on various cell lines.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  == rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus (rrn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. in this study,  antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract as well as rhinacanthin-c against streptococcus mutans, propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. it was found that the rrn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against s. mutans with mic and mbc of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against s. epidermidis, p. acnes and s. aureus with the mics of 8-16 microg/ml. however, the rrn extract was not active against  c. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-c. stability evaluations of the rrn extract through a period of 4 months found that the rrn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees c or 30+/-2 degrees c. the rrn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees c with 75% relative humidity, the rrn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. study on the effect of ph on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the rrn extract found that the solutions were not stable at ph 5.5, ph 7.0, and ph 8.0. however, the rhinacanthin solution at ph 5.5 was more stable than those at ph 7.0 and ph 8.0.

TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == antibacterial activity of totarol and its potentiation.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of six diterpenoids isolated from the bark of podocarpus nagi (podocarpaceae) has been tested against twelve selected microorganisms. totarol [1], the most abundant compound among the six, exhibited potent bactericidal activity only against gram-positive bacteria, among which propionibacterium acnes was the most sensitive bacterium. totarol also showed strong activity against four other gram-positive bacteria tested: streptococcus mutans, bacillus subtilis, brevibacterium ammoniagenes, and staphylococcus aureus (both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains). the bactericidal  activity of totarol was enhanced when it was tested in combination with several other natural products. noticeably, the activity of totarol against sta. aureus was increased eightfold when tested in combination with 1/2mic of anacardic acid  [9]. the synergistic activity of anacardic acid caused the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of totarol to be lowered from 1.56 to 0.2 micrograms/ml.

TI  == antibacterial activity of crinitol and its potentiation.
AB  == an acyclic diterpene alcohol, crinitol [1], was identified in a marine brown alga, sargassum tortile, as the principal antibacterial agent against gram-positive bacteria, among which propionibacterium acnes was most sensitive and, staphylococcus aureus was least. to enhance its activity, crinitol was combined with several antioxidants, which presumably retard oxidative destruction of this molecule which possesses two easily oxidizable allylic alcohol groups. two synthetic antioxidants, bha (butylated hydroxyanisole) and bht (butylated hydroxytoluene), significantly enhanced the activity of crinitol, especially against streptococcus mutans. interestingly, crinitol also synergized bht and bha against this cariogenic bacterium.

TI  == invasion of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius and propionibacterium acnes into the teeth of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == germ-free rats, fed a modified cariogenic diet 2000 with a reduced sucrose content of 25%, were inoculated with a strain of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius or propionibacterium acnes, respectively. after 100 days on the diet, the rats were sacrificed. microscopic examination of stained decalcified tooth sections revealed marked destruction of the outer zones of the  dentin infected with s. mutans. the destruction was closely associated with the formation of glucan-mediated large aggregates of s. mutans. the aggregates, however, were rarely formed in the deep zones of the infected dentin. inoculation with s. intermedius and p. acnes had little effect on the microscopic outline of  the decalcified tooth sections. however, the staining behavior of the sections with mallory's method, alcian blue-pas and silver was like that of the tooth sections infected with s. mutans, even in the central and inner zones of the dentin. the histochemical alterations of the deep zones of the dentin induced by  the three infected bacteria appeared to be due to their proteolytic rather than to their acidogenic activities.

TI  == [cariogenicity of propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus mutans in germ-free rats].
AB  == a comparative study has been made on the cariogenic potentials of propionibacterium acnes atcc 11828, streptococcus intermedius oe-1 and streptococcus mutans oz-1. the strains of p. acnes and s. intermedius have chondroitinase activity. as metabolic end-products, the p. acnes strain produces  mainly a weak acid, propionic acid, whereas strong lactic acid is the main product of the strains of s. intermedius and s. mutans. five germ-free rats were  used for infection with each bacterial strain. the rats were fed with a 25% sucrose diet for 100 days and then sacrificed. the upper and lower molars were used for the determination of the smooth surface caries score. the right upper and lower jaws were used for the preparation of sections which were employed for  the determination of the fissure caries score and microradiography. the left upper and lower jaws were decalcified and used for the preparation of thin sections for staining with gram's, hematoxilin eosin, mallory's, alcian blue-pas, silver and toluidine blue stain. the results obtained were as follows: 1. the recoveries of infected cells in the specimens obtained by swabbing the oral cavities were in the order of 10(4) cfu/mg wet weight regardless of the strains injected. 2. macroscopically, the p. acnes strain decalcified to a lesser extent  some of the enamel surfaces of the lower molars. however, the s. intermedius strain produced mainly the fissure caries of the lower molars. the s. mutans strain destroyed the enamel extensively, resulting in the induction of rampant carious lesions. 3. the caries scores of smooth surface determined by keyes's method were 19.4 +/- 7.8, 46.8 +/- 5.8 and 118.4 +/- 15.4 in the rats infected with the strains of p. acnes, s. intermedius and s. mutans, respectively. the fissure caries score determined by the modified konig's method were 8.5, 22.3 and 36.5 in the sections prepared from the rats infected with the strains of p. acnes, s. intermedius and s. mutans, respectively. 4. microradiography revealed no translucent area in the enamel and dentine of the p. acnes-infected molars, while in the s. intermedius-infected molars translucent areas were found at the dentino-enamel junction neighboring the bottoms of some fissures. the s. mutans-infected molars showed extensive translucent areas over the enamel and dentine of all of the molars. even defects of the enamel and dentinal areas were  observed in some of the molars. 5. the decalcified tooth sections were stained in a similar manner irrespective of the type of organisms used to infect them.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
