TI  == identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from haemophilus ducreyi which confers nad independence.
AB  == members of the family pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an nad supplement for growth on laboratory media. in this study, we  demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadv, whose presence allows nad-independent growth of haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. this gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for nad independence in haemophilus ducreyi. when transformed into a. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed nad-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of nad on defined media. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular  mass of 55,619 da. compared with the sequence databases, nadv was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor pbef and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, shewanella putrefaciens, synechocystis sp., deinococcus radiodurans, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. p. multocida and a. actinomycetemcomitans are among the nad-independent members of the pasteurellaceae. homologues of nadv  were not found in the sequenced genome of h. influenzae, an nad-dependent member  of the pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of nad, such as escherichia coli. sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. identification of a function for this gene in the pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
