TI  == the ongoing revolution of maldi-tof mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical africa.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. a maldi-tof ms was introduced to tropical africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the hopital principal de dakar  (senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. using ms, 2,429 bacteria  and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). maldi-tof ms has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. maldi-tof ms is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical africa.

TI  == influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  == recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases,  to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. the performance of rpa with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in dna sequences on rpa amplification reaction is not  well understood. we investigated the specificity of rpa by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the  cfb gene sequence of streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on rpa efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, s. agalactiae, p. aeruginosa, and m. tuberculosis as well as bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. a total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. we observed that target specific rpa primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered rpa reaction. in addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected rpa yield. we demonstrated that the specificity of rpa was multifactorial. therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. we recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. it is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in a finnish tertiary care hospital: a retrospective cohort study of 2175 episodes during the years 1999-2001 and 2005-2010.
AB  == background: nosocomial infections are major causes of morbidity in hospitalized patients. methods: retrospective laboratory-based surveillance during 1999-2001 and 2005-2010 identified 2175 cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) in tampere university hospital (tauh), finland. results: analysis revealed that 57% of bsis were caused by a gram-positive organism, 27% by a gram-negative organism, 5% by a fungal organism, and 11% were polymicrobial. the most common cause of nosocomial bsi was coagulase-negative staphylococci (23%). candida species caused 5% of the infections. the 7-day and 30-day case fatalities were 8% (161/2158) and 15% (313/2175), respectively, and were highest in bsis caused by candida albicans (22% and 44%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 25%). the median age of patients was 54 years in 1999-2001, 57 years in 2005-2007, and 60 years in 2008-2010 (p < 0.001). the median time from hospital admission to the onset of bsi was 11 days (quartiles 5-18 days). this period was shortest for streptococcus agalactiae bsi and longest for candida non-albicans fungemia (1 vs  19 days). the case fatality rate in nosocomial bsi decreased during the years studied: 7-day and 30-day case fatalities were 9% and 16% during 1999-2001, 8.5%  and 16% during 2005-2007, and 5% and 12% during 2008-2010, respectively (p < 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively). conclusions: gram-positive infections predominate in nosocomial bsis. the median age of patients with nosocomial bsi has risen during the study years. the case fatality associated with nosocomial bsi has decreased.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == electrospun doxy-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) nanofiber mats: in vitro drug release and antibacterial properties investigation.
AB  == electrospun doxy-h loaded-poly(acrylic acid) (paa) nanofiber mats (paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats) were prepared by the electrospinning technique and post-spinning  sorption method at various doses: paa/doxy-h125, paa/doxy-h250, paa/doxy-h500, and paa/doxy-h1000. the morphology, drug content, release characteristics, and antibacterial activities of the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats were investigated with  scanning electron microscopy, uv-vis spectrophotometry, and disc diffusion methodology. the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats had a diameter range of 285-340 nm, and a smooth surface without beads. adsorption isotherms of doxy-h could be described well with the freundlich model. the amounts of doxy-h, after the post-spinning sorption process, in the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats ranged between 27.57 and 101.71 mg/g. all of the paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats exhibited an initial  burst release characteristic with cumulative releasing percentages between 37.14  and 45.97%, which followed the fickian diffusion mechanism. based on the antibacterial investigation, the tested gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae, seemed to be more sensitive to paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats than the tested gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa. these paa/doxy-h nanofiber mats could be used as an antibacterial wound dressing.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == antibacterial activities and in vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stability) properties of methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves.
AB  == this work is carried out with gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. the leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. methanol extract from the leaves of gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. the lower concentrations of methanolic leaf extract of gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with kanamycin. the crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of aspirin as positive control. the methanolic extracts of gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms like streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, and proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. the extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.

TI  == is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures?
AB  == heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem.the focused update on infective endocarditis of american college of cardiology/american heart association 2008 (acc/aha guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the european society of cardiology (esc guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis as not recommended for urinary tract procedures in the absence of active infection. a statistical association has been recently shown between urological procedures and the development of infective endocarditis. new  evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to actinobaculum schaalii, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aerococci and staphylococcus aureus, and new findings indicate there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing urological procedures especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.

TI  == the microbiology of bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis in children.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiology of secondary bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis and the appropriateness of current antimicrobial practice in one institution. methods: a 14-year retrospective single-centre study of 69 consecutive paediatric patients (age 1-14 years) with appendicitis-related peritonitis and positive peritoneal specimen cultures was conducted. post-operative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analysed in all patients. results: escherichia coli was  identified in 56/69 (81 %) peritoneal specimens; four isolates were resistant to  amoxicillin-clavulanate, and one other isolate was resistant to gentamicin. anaerobes were identified in 37/69 (54 %) peritoneal specimens; two anaerobic isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and one isolate was resistant  to metronidazole. pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 4/69 (6 %) peritoneal  specimens, and all were susceptible to gentamicin. streptococcal species (two group f streptococci and three beta-haemolytic streptococci) were identified in 5/69 (7 %) specimens, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. combination therapy involving amoxicillin-clavulanate and aminoglycoside is appropriate empirical treatment in 68/69 (99 %) patients. addition of metronidazole to this regime would provide 100 % initial empirical coverage. inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant e. coli were independent predictors of the post-operative infectious complications observed in 14/69 (20 %) patients. conclusion: e. coli and mixed anaerobes are the predominant organisms identified  in secondary peritonitis from appendicitis in children. inadequate initial empirical antibiotic and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant e. coli may contribute to increased post-operative infectious complications. this study provides evidence-based information on choice of combination therapy for paediatric appendicitis-related bacterial peritonitis.

TI  == improved protease stability of the antimicrobial peptide pin2 substituted with d-amino acids.
AB  == cationic antimicrobial peptides (amps) have attracted a great interest as novel class of antibiotics that might help in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. however, some amps with high antimicrobial activities are also highly hemolytic and subject to proteolytic degradation from  human and bacterial proteases that limit their pharmaceutical uses. in this work  a d-diastereomer of pandinin 2, d-pin2, was constructed to observe if it maintained antimicrobial activity in the same range as the parental one, but with the purpose of reducing its hemolytic activity to human erythrocytes and improving its ability to resist proteolytic cleavage. although, the hydrophobic and secondary structure characteristics of l- and d-pin2 were to some extent similar, an important reduction in d-pin2 hemolytic activity (30-40 %) was achieved compared to that of l-pin2 over human erythrocytes. furthermore, d-pin2  had an antimicrobial activity with a mic value of 12.5 mum towards staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa in agar diffusion assays, but it was half less potent than that of l-pin2. nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of d-pin2 was equally effective  as that of l-pin2 in microdilution assays. yet, when d- and l-pin2 were incubated with trypsin, elastase and whole human serum, only d-pin2 kept its antimicrobial  activity towards all bacteria, but in diluted human serum, l- and d-pin2 maintained similar peptide stability. finally, when l- and d-pin2 were incubated  with proteases from p. aeruginosa dfu3 culture, a clinical isolated strain, d-pin2 kept its antibiotic activity while l-pin2 was not effective.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == real-time pcr assays compared to culture-based approaches for identification of aerobic bacteria in chronic wounds.
AB  == chronic wounds cause substantial morbidity and disability. infection in chronic wounds is clinically defined by routine culture methods that can take several days to obtain a final result, and may not fully describe the community of organisms or biome within these wounds. molecular diagnostic approaches offer promise for a more rapid and complete assessment. we report the development of a  suite of real-time pcr assays for rapid identification of bacteria directly from  tissue samples. the panel of assays targets 14 common, clinically relevant, aerobic pathogens and demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity using a panel of organisms commonly associated with chronic wound infection. thirty-nine tissue samples from 29 chronic wounds were evaluated and the results  compared with those obtained by culture. as revealed by culture and pcr, the most common organisms were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) followed by streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the sensitivities of the pcr assays were 100% and 90% when quantitative and qualitative culture results were used as the reference standard, respectively. the assays allowed the identification of bacterial dna from ten additional organisms that were not revealed by quantitative or qualitative cultures. under optimal conditions, the turnaround time for pcr results is as short as 4-6 h. real-time pcr is a rapid and inexpensive approach that can be easily introduced into clinical practice for detection of organisms directly from tissue samples. characterization of the anaerobic microflora by real-time pcr of chronic wounds is warranted.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  == background: the urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and  contraceptive agents in recent years. in the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. methodology/principal findings: toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (mdck) cells, human sperm cells, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of mdck cells was also tested. a homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-n,n,n-trimethylammonium bromides (c(n)tab), with varying alkyl chains were  shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (cmc), all of them at concentrations significantly below the cmc. in general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than c. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than mdck cells. this suggests that the c(n)tab may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. none of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used  in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection  of mdck cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to mdck cells. conclusions/significance: the results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.

AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an argentinean multicenter study.
AB  == tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. we conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 argentinean institutions. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. the number of isolates and mics 50/90 (mg/l) for tigecycline were the following: acinetobacter spp. 132  (0.5/1); escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); s. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). we conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in argentina.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

AB  == seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group a streptococcus, group b streptococcus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). all surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds.  the average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). no clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. the use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising  fasciitis was easy and effective. local or systemic infection was negligible.

TI  == the group b streptococcal sialic acid o-acetyltransferase is encoded by neud, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  == nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (sia), and several sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. some pathogens are also known to o-acetylate their sias, although  the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. we report that neud, a gene located within the group b streptococcus (gbs) sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a sia o-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (cps) sialylation. homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified lys-123 as a critical residue for sia o-acetyltransferase activity. moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neud can determine whether gbs displays a "high" or "low" sia o-acetylation phenotype. complementation analysis  revealed that escherichia coli k1 neud also functions as a sia o-acetyltransferase in gbs. in fact, neud homologs are commonly found within sia  biosynthetic gene clusters. a bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neud. included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens legionella pneumophila, vibrio parahemeolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for sia expression. phylogenetic analysis shows that neud homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-sia o-acetyltransferase of e.  coli k1. these studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of gbs sia o-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.

TI  == relationship between oral motor dysfunction and oral bacteria in bedridden elderly.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between oral bacterial colonization and oral motor dysfunction. study design: oral motor dysfunction (swallowing and speech disorders) and detection of oral bacterial species from dental plaque in 55 elderly persons who had remained hospitalized for more than 3 months were investigated and statistically analyzed. results: the detection rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus agalactiae, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were significantly higher in subjects with than in those without a swallowing disorder. a similar result was found with regard to the presence of a  speech disorder. about half of subjects who had oral motor dysfunction and hypoalbuminemia had colonization by mrsa and/or pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: these results suggest that the combination of oral motor dysfunction  and hypoalbminemia elevated the risk of opportunistic microorganisms colonization in the oral cavity of elderly patients hospitalized over the long term.

TI  == capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for glycoscreening in biomedical research.
AB  == application of capillary electrophoresis (ce) in combination with mass spectrometry (ms) and tandem ms to glycoscreening in biomedical projects is highlighted. in the first part recent ce-ms experiments by sheath liquid ce and multiple stage ms are reported. neutral and negatively charged n-glycan mixtures  from ribonuclease b and fetuin, high-mannose type n-glycoforms, oligosaccharides  from lipopolysaccharides (lps) of haemophilus influenzae, polysaccharides of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were analyzed. a particular emphasis is devoted to the applicability of novel off- and on-line ce-ms and tandem ms methods for screening of proteoglycan-derived oligosaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (gags), such as hyaluronates from streptococcus agalactiae, chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (cs/ds) from bovine aorta and human skin fibroblast decorin, and heparin/heparan sulfate (hs) from porcine and bovine mucosa. the performance of ce-ms/ms for identification of glycoforms in glycopeptides and glycoproteins is illustrated by experiments performed on complex mixtures from urine of patients suffering from a hereditary n-acetylhexosaminidase deficiency (schindler's disease) and urine of patients suffering from cancer cachexia. for determination of glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins like enzymes and antibodies by ce/ms, both ce-matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi)  and ce-electrospray ionization (esi)-ms were functional. finally, the potential of ce-esi-ms strategy in glycolipid analysis is demonstrated for gangliosides from bovine brain for which particular ce buffer conditions are required.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
AB  == gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some gram-positive organisms. we compared the in vitro activity  of these compounds against 4151 gram-negative and -positive organisms. gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. all compounds were highly active (overall) against gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being  the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa. our data indicate that the  advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == altered surfactant protein b levels in transgenic mice do not affect clearance of bacteria from the lungs.
AB  == to determine the role of surfactant protein b (sp-b) in bacterial clearance from  the airways, three groups of mice expressing different levels of sp-b were studied: wild-type mice, hemizygous sp-b mice, and sp-b overexpressing transgenic mice. sp-b levels in overexpressing mice were increased 5-fold relative to hemizygous mice and 2- to 3-fold over wild-type littermates. mice from each group were infected intratracheally with the common airway pathogens, group b streptococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa. there was no significant difference in the number of recoverable viable bacteria at 6 h (group b streptococci and p. aeruginosa) and at 24 h (p. aeruginosa) among the three groups. similarly, systemic dissemination of bacteria was not different among the three groups for both pathogens and at both time points. we conclude that sp-b levels in vivo do not influence clearance of bacteria from the lungs.

AB  == objective: to define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. study design: maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. results: logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% ci 1.004-8.56), apgar score after 1 min (odds  ratio 0.7, 95% ci 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis  (odds ratio 4.1, 95% ci 1.36-12.12). there was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% ci 1.07-17.40). funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. conclusions: independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. the histological examination of the umbilical cord can  be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.

TI  == lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant by bacteria.
AB  == the epithelium of the lung is lined with extracellular pulmonary surfactant. this is the surface that invading bacteria first come into contact with when they enter the alveoli. as bacteria become established and interact with this layer, various characteristics of surfactant may become altered. we studied free radical production by three bacterial species, group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the effect of two concentrations of lung surfactant (curosurf at 0.04 and 0.4 mg/ml) on this production estimated by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction test. we also measured the lipid peroxidation of surfactant at various incubation times (0-20 h), using a lpo-586 test kit. in addition, the effect of vitamin e as an antioxidant in a concentration of 0.5 microm was determined by the lipid peroxidation test. we found that the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by the three bacterial species and lipid peroxidation  of lung surfactant increased with time. vitamin e reduced the lipid peroxidation  of this surfactant. by measuring bacterial growth at various incubation times we  showed that lung surfactant was bactericidal to group b streptococcal and e. coli strains and that p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to surfactant. we conclude  that bacteria, probably by their production of reactive oxygen species, cause lipid peroxidation of lung surfactant.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == infection of the pancreatic duct following pancreas transplantation with bladder  drainage.
AB  == combined kidney-pancreas transplantation represents a widely accepted therapy for endstage diabetic nephropathy. drainage of the pancreatic juice into the urinary  bladder is the preferred surgical technique in most centers. between january 1987 and december 1994 a total of 85 pancreas transplantations with pancreatocystostomy were performed at the innsbruck university hospital. in all cases a polyvinylcatheter was placed into the pancreatic duct and drained transvesically to the exterior. during several weeks after transplantation pure pancreatic juice was harvested for immunological and microbiological monitoring.  whenever a patient required antibiotic treatment, antibiotic concentrations in pancreatic juice, urine or serum were determined by means of a biological test system using bacillus subtilis. nine different atcc bacterial strains were incubated in pancreatic juice collected from transplant recipients and tested for their multiplication rate. thirteen patients acquired an infection of the pancreatic duct. non-fermentative bacteria, gram-negative rods, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. were the most often isolated organisms. the in vitro tests revealed that pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and escherichia coli grew very well whereas streptococcus agalactiae was unable to multiply in pancreatic juice. ampicillin/sulbactam was found to be excreted in high concentrations into the pancreatic juice. many other tested antibiotics (cephalosporins, carboxypenicillins and aminoglycosides) achieved levels below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for most bacteria. antibiotic treatment was required for up to 5 weeks to eliminate the pathogens from the pancreas but was successful in 11 out of the 13 patients at the end. the results  of this study led to changes in our antibiotic policy and helped to improve the results after pancreatic transplantation.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == species-specific interpretive breakpoints for ciprofloxacin disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  == when ciprofloxacin was introduced on the swedish market the recommended interpretive standards for disk diffusion susceptibility testing using a 10 microgram disk were: sensitive greater than or equal to 24 mm (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and resistant less than 18 mm (mic greater than 4 mg/l), except  for enterococci where s greater than or equal to 18 mm and r less than 14 mm were recommended. a quality control study revealed that the accuracy of the routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin was low. 50% of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and 90% of streptococcus agalactiae strains were falsely assigned to the intermediate instead of the sensitive category, and the test missed to detect true resistance in pseudomonas maltophilia. new species-specific breakpoints were determined by the sra method. separate breakpoints were required only for the pseudomonas species. streptococcus faecalis was found to belong mainly to the intermediate group and it is suggested that these strains are not categorized as sensitive. the breakpoints that gave acceptable accuracy in routine susceptibility testing of ciprofloxacin were s greater than or equal to 20 mm, r less than 13 mm for all relevant bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa  for which s greater than or equal to 27 mm, r less than 18 mm is proposed, and pseudomonas maltophilia where s greater than or equal to 30 mm, r less than 23 mm are adequate breakpoints. the 10 microgram disk gave acceptable inhibition zones  for all strains with mics within the clinically interesting mic range.

TI  == lung antibacterial defense mechanisms in infant and adult rats: implications for  the pathogenesis of group b streptococcal infections in the neonatal lung.
AB  == we investigated factors that may contribute to lung infections in infants by studying the intrapulmonary responses to aerosols of three different types of organisms--group b streptococcus with and without type-specific capsule, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus--in infant (12-h-old or 24-36-h-old) and adult (150 g, 6-w-old) rats. after aerosol exposure, the lung clearance rate of each organism varied inversely with the age of the animals, and the magnitude of the clearance defect was related more strongly to animal age than to the bacterial species. fewer alveolar macrophages from infant animals phagocytosed each type of organism in vivo, and the rate of neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of infant animals was delayed. the neonatal lung functioned effectively, however, as an antibacterial barrier, as newborn animals  survived an aerosolized inoculum that exceeded the ld50 by the subcutaneous route.

TI  == the effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  == amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

TI  == role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  == experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or hemophilus influenzae. the third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. cefotaxime has produced high cure  rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or h. influenzae. several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, or h. influenzae. moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. of 14 patients with pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by enterobacter, serratia, or acinetobacter. more, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.

TI  == reversible inhibition of bacterial growth after specific inhibition of spermidine synthase by dicyclohexylamine.
AB  == the effect of dicyclohexylamine on seven freshly isolated bacterial strains of mastitis pathogens was studied. streptococcus uberis was the most sensitive strain investigated, since 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine totally arrested its growth and 1.25 mm of the drug caused 60% growth inhibition. the staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also sensitive to the drug, but less so than strep. uberis, since 5 mm drug caused only partial inhibition of growth. micrococcus sp. and klebsiella sp. grew in the presence of  10.0 mm-dicyclohexylamine, and, finally the growth of streptococcus agalactiae was not at all affected by dicyclohexylamine. these different sensitivities towards dicyclohexylamine in vivo were paralleled by different sensitivities of the bacteria's spermidine synthase to the drug in vitro, and also by the ability  of the drug to lower spermidine concentration in bacterial cells. spermidine synthase from sensitive bacteria was inhibited by more than 90% by 50 microm-dicyclohexylamine in vitro, and the concentration of spermidine was decreased in e. coli and ps. aeruginosa by 70% and in strep. uberis by 95%, whereas in strep. agalactiae 5 mm-dicyclohexylamine did not affect the concentration of spermidine at all. dicyclohexylamine treatment led to the accumulation of putrescine in strep. uberis. spermidine synthesis catalysed by the extracts of micrococcus sp. required 500 microm-dicyclohexylamine for 90% inhibition, and strep. agalactiae contained a spermidine synthase that was still  active at 1000 microm-dicyclohexylamine, the observed inhibition of growth was totally reversed by adding 50 microm-spermidine (final concentration) to the medium. putrescine reversed the inhibition only when bacteria had a spermidine synthase activity insensitive to dicyclohexylamine. spermine did not overcome the inhibition of growth caused by dicyclohexylamine, probably because it was not taken up by the bacterial cells used in this study. the inhibition of the growth  by dicyclohexylamine (even in the case of strep. uberis) was reversible in the sense that addition of 50 microm-spermidine 18 h after dicyclohexylamine still restored the growth rate of untreated controls.

TI  == assessment in the mouse of cefoperazone as a treatment for mastitis.
AB  == the value of cefoperazone in mastitis therapy was assessed in the mouse model of  mastitis primarily by its effect on bacterial cell numbers in the gland. in addition histological studies showed that the drug was not an irritant in the mammary gland. pharmacokinetic studies showed that it was slowly absorbed from the gland (six days to absorb 500 micrograms) but was easily removed by milking.  in ascending order of efficacy cefoperazone (500 micrograms/gland) was active against four-hour-old intramammary infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and strep uberis. the effect against staph aureus was titrated down to a dose of 50 micrograms/gland. cefoperazone was not bactericidal against intracellular staphylococci but it did sensitise them to the action of lytic enzyme. cefoperazone and cloxacillin behaved similarly against progressive staphylococcal mastitis. both antibiotics significantly reduced the bacterial numbers when four-hour-old infections were treated but the effect on 26-hour-old infections was perceptible only when each antibiotic was assayed against saline treatment in the mouse. the results suggest that further studies in dairy cattle should be undertaken.

TI  == interbacterial adherence between actinomyces viscosus and strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == interbacterial adherence was sought between strains of actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. six of nine strains of s. pyogenes, three of five strains of s. agalactiae, and two of four strains of p. aeruginosa were found to coaggregate with each of five strains of a. viscosus tested. some coaggregation reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose and were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive actinomyces components. such reactions appear to involve the galactosyl-binding adhesin previously described in type 2 fimbriae on a. viscosus. other coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pathogen. that such pathogen  strains possessed an adhesin(s) was further suggested by the observation that they agglutinated human erythrocytes. the ability of coaggregation-positive and -negative strains of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae to adhere to actinomyces-coated agarose beads was also studied. coaggregation-positive streptococcal strains attached in higher numbers to the actinomyces-coated beads  than did strains which were coaggregation negative. lactose (0.05 m) inhibited the attachment of those streptococcal strains which coaggregated with a. viscosus in a lactose-sensitive manner. the adherence of those streptococcal strains whose coaggregation appeared to depend upon the galactosyl-binding adhesin of a. viscosus was also reduced by components of human saliva. crude sonic extracts of  coaggregation-positive streptococci or of p. aeruginosa were also effective in aggregating actinomyces cells. the effect of lactose and of salivary components on this extract-induced aggregation of actinomyces cells generally paralleled that observed in other assays. the apparent prevalence and diversity of adherent  reactions between the pathogens studied and indigenous strains of a. viscosus suggest that some may affect host susceptibility to these infectious agents.

TI  == comparative opsonic activity of intravenous gamma globulin preparations for common bacterial pathogens.
AB  == immune globulin intravenous is a reduced and alkylated preparation of gamma globulin that is stabilized in 10 percent maltose and 0.1 m glycine at ph 6.8. recently, a modified immune globulin intravenous preparation was developed that is identical to the standard preparation except that it does not contain glycine  and the ph has been lowered to 5.25. the effect of these modifications has resulted in a higher igg monomer content in the preparation. in the present studies the opsonic activity against several common bacterial pathogens was assessed in the standard (ph 6.8) versus the more acidic immune globulin intravenous (ph 5.25). opsonic activity was detected in each preparation for staphylococcus aureus, group b streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, and serratia marcescens. with all of the organisms except s. marcescens, an intact complement system was required for optimal uptake and killing with each preparation. in general, the opsonic activity of the ph 5.25 immune globulin intravenous was equivalent to the standard ph 6.8 preparation. with several organisms, however, the more acidic preparation had greater activity than the standard one. an immune globulin intravenous preparation with increased antibody  titers to p. aeruginosa was also prepared from selected donors and tested for opsonic activity against six of the seven pseudomonas immunotypes. this preparation was found to have strikingly increased opsonic titers for most of the pseudomonas immunotypes when compared with the standard immune globulin intravenous. these studies indicate that changes in donor selection or minor modifications in production techniques may markedly affect the biologic activity  of intravenous gamma globulin.

TI  == comparative anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa activity of chemically modified and native immunoglobulin g (human), and potentiation of antibiotic protection against pseudomonas aeruginosa and group b streptococcus in vivo.
AB  == immunoglobulin g intravenous is prepared by controlled reduction and alkylation of approximately four interheavy chain disulfide bonds per molecule. to determine if the protective activity of antibody modified by this process is diminished, mice were treated with identical doses of reduced and alkylated igg and native igg prepared from the same plasma pool. three hours later mice were given a 10 percent body surface burn followed by challenge with the seven fisher-devlin-gnabasik immunotypes of pseudomonas aeruginosa. against five of the seven immunotypes, the 50 percent protective doses were approximately 100 mg or less per kg body weight. overall there was no significant difference in protection afforded to the mice by the two immunoglobulin preparations indicating that in vivo the activity of igg against p. aeruginosa remains unimpaired by reduction and alkylation. in the second part of this study, immunoglobulin g intravenous significantly enhanced the activity of tobramycin and carbenicillin in the treatment of p. aeruginosa infection in burned mice and of penicillin g in the treatment of group b streptococcus 1c infection in normal mice.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == a study of 320 samples of mammary quarters from cows in 40 dairy farms around santa fe city during 1977-1978 was made. the samples were selected based on clinical examination and california mastitis test (gmt). high percentage of subclinical mastitis was found. the etiological agents most frequently isolated were staphylococcus aureus (54,1%), streptococcus agalactiae (23.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (13,2%). a winter increment of s. aureus (48,1%) and p. aeruginosa (3,7% and 22,5%) was observed. but s. agalactiae did not experiment considerable variation (26,8% and 20% throughout the year. the sensitivity to antibiotics of some strains decreased in winter specially in s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (61,5% and 38,9%), and some biochemical properties related with their  virulence increased. penicillin in milk was not detected, but the levels of contamination by non specific inhibitory substances were very high (40%). besides it was found a great contamination with aerobic sporeforming bacteria in these samples, being bacillus coagulans (59,1%), b. polymyxa (26,1%) and b. sphaericus  (9,5%) the most frequent.

TI  == hygiene in the prevention of udder infections. iv. evaluation of teat dips with excised cows' teats.
AB  == suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to contaminate teats excised from cows. commercially available teat dips were applied for evaluation of comparative germicidal activity. iodophors, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium dichloro-s-triazenetrione were highly effective against all four test organisms.  quarternary ammonium, chlorhexidine, and cetylpyridinium chloride were effective  against staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae but not escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bronopol and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate were marginally effective on the two gram positive organisms and ineffective on the two gram negatives. three of the dips were ineffective against all four pathogens; two were in nonaqueous bases, and the other was a blend of pine oil and antibodies with udder origin. in other trials, iodophor at .3% titratable iodine was highly effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. products containing .5 and 1% iodophor maintained effectiveness after each was used to dip 140 teats under conditions of commercial dairying. logarithmic reduction in the geometric mean number of organisms recovered from teats was more meaningful for evaluating data than percent reduction.

TI  == pathogenesis of bacteremia due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice and potentiation of virulence of endogenous streptococci.
AB  == mice treated with cyclophosphamide on day 0 were killed at sequential intervals during subsequent administration of pseudomonas aeruginosa in drinking water and  were examined for sites of bacterial colonization and multiplication with use of  peroxidase-labeled antibody and culture techniques. these studies were coordinated with those of clinical and histopathologic changes. bacterial antigen was first detected on day 4 on the surface of nasal squamocolumnar junctions and  the stratum corneum of gingival sulci and crests. invasion of tissue by p. aeruginosa proceeded rapidly from these sites and led to bacteremia. there was no invasion of the lower alimentary canal. endogenous group b beta-hemolytic streptococci colonized and penetrated ulcers created by previous pseudomonas invasion. these results suggest that epithelial colonization is the critical event in the pathogenesis of bacteremia due to p. aeruginosa in the immunosuppressed host. the resulting infection may provide a conduit for invasion and enhancement of the virulence of endogenous streptococci.

TI  == bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. the bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), enterobacteriaceae (four patients), staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups a and b) (three patients), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had  six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.

TI  == ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than .001), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (p less than .001) and aeromonas hydrophilia (p less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for staphylococcus aureus (p less than .001), streptococcus agalactiae (p less than .001), staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .001) and streptococcus viridans (p less than .005). significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli.

TI  == [selective effect of propolis in the isolation of listeria monocytogenes (author's transl)].
AB  == propolis is a substance produced by honeybees. it is inhibitory to some bacteria  species, mainly gram-positive bacteria, but less inhibitory to listeria monocytogenes (l.m) than to the other gram-positive bacteria tested. in order to  obtain selective growth of l.m. from contaminated samples, the effect of propolis in plating media and broths on various strains of bacteria was examined. table i  shows the effect of increasing concentrations of propolis in tryptose-agar (ta).  l.m. tolerated higher concentrations of propolis than streptococcus viridans and  staphylococcus aureus. l.m. grew well in tryptosebroth (tb) that contained 0.15 mg propolis pr. ml medium, while streptococcus viridans and streptococcus agalactiae were completely inhibited as seen in table ii. table iii shows that when serum was added to the agar, the inhibitory effect was reduced. it can also  be seen that gram-negative bacteria grew quite well on media that contained 0.19  mg propolis pr. ml. to reduce the growth of gram-negative bacteria, nalidixic acid was added to the medium. table iv illustrates growth of various species of bacteria in tryptosephosphatebroth (tfb) with or without propolis and nalidixic acid. most of the strains tested were inhibited, but pseudomonas aeruginosa and to some extent faecal streptococci were able to grow in the medium that contained the selective substances. as a conclusion it seems that propolis may be a valuable additive to a medium for the selective isolation of l.m.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == [devitalizing effect of jodonal a in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  == in a three-minute exposure in vitro jodonal a devitalized a culture of serological group b streptococci in a 2% concentration, staphylococcus aureus in  a 16% concentration, pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. hence jodonal a concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  == colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. since the microcontour of the canine distal  urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina.  the normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. it consisted principally of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium and acinetobacter-haemophilus. estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-streptococcus and acinetobacter-haemophilus. a normal canine transient, escherichia coli, and a normal resident, corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. in contrast, human escherichia coli and pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus  (8.5 days). the commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the  susceptibility to colonization.
