TI  == isolation of nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants of nitroreductase-producing clostridium sp. strains from the human intestinal tract.
AB  == five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of clostridium leptum, clostridium paraputrificum, two other clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and clostridium perfringens atcc 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. all of the clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. the nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. at least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible bacillus sp. strain. nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. this study indicates that clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.
