TI  == the use of pfge method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. in recent years,  interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly  increased. in order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. pulse-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. the following study describes a way of performing pfge analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus lactobacillus: l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == administration of probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus gasseri k7 during pregnancy and lactation changes mouse mesenteric lymph nodes and mammary gland microbiota.
AB  == the milk and mammary gland (mg) microbiome can be influenced by several factors,  such as mode of delivery, breastfeeding, maternal lifestyle, health status, and diet. an increasing number of studies show a variety of positive effects of consumption of probiotics during pregnancy and breastfeeding on the mother and the newborn. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of probiotics lactobacillus gasseri k7 (lk7) and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) during pregnancy and lactation on microbiota of the mouse mesenteric lymph nodes (mln), mg, and milk. pregnant fvb/n mice were fed skim milk or probiotics lgg or lk7 resuspended in skim milk during gestation and lactation. on d 3 and 8 postpartum, blood, feces, mln, mg, and milk were analyzed for the presence of lgg or lk7. the effects of probiotics on mln, mg, and milk microbiota was evaluated by real-time pcr and by 16s ribosomal dna 454-pyrosequencing. in 5 of 8 fecal samples from the lgg group and in 5 of 8 fecal samples from the lk7 group, more than 1x10(3) of live lgg or lk7 bacterial  cells were detected, respectively, whereas no viable lgg or lk7 cells were detected in the control group. live lactic acid bacteria but no lgg or lk7 were detected in blood, mln, and mg. both probiotics significantly increased the total bacterial load as assessed by copies of 16s ribosomal dna in mln, and a similar trend was observed in mg. metagenomic sequencing revealed that both probiotics increased the abundance of firmicutes in mg, especially the abundance of lactic acid bacteria. the lactobacillus genus appeared exclusively in mg from probiotic  groups. both probiotics influenced mln microbiota by decreasing diversity (chao1) and increasing the distribution of species (shannon index). the lgg probiotic also affected the mg microbiota as it increased diversity and distribution of species and proportions of the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. these results provide evidence that probiotics can modulate the bacterial composition of mln and mg microbiota in ways that could improve the health of the mg and, ultimately, the health of the newborn.

TI  == rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using maldi-tof ms analysis and 16s rdna sequencing.
AB  == background: lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof  ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna  analysis. results: both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral lactobacillus isolates. the concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. in the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei. overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. for several samples, maldi-tof ms  analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result. conclusion: maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant  lactobacillus species.

TI  == phenotypic surface properties (aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation) and presence of related genes in beneficial vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the phenotypic expression of auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation of lactobacilli isolated from human vagina and the presence of related genes. methods and results: seven different strains of three  lactobacillus species (lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri) were evaluated. the auto-aggregation property was determined by spectrophotometric assay and flow cytometry. adhesion and biofilm formation were assayed by crystal violet staining. the presence of the genes encoding sortases, pilin subunits and surface proteins was evaluated by polymerase chain reactions. the two lact. reuteri strains assayed showed high auto-aggregation, adhesion to mucin and biofilm formation ability. in these strains, the genes encoding three adhesion proteins were identified. in lact. rhamnosus crl (centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection) 1332, pilus-encoding genes were detected. in all lact. rhamnosus strains assayed, two genes encoding for other surface proteins related to adhesion and biofilm formation were detected. conclusions: the vaginal lactobacilli assayed exhibited  phenotypic and genetic characteristics that were specific for each strain. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study on auto-aggregation, adhesion and biofilm formation of vaginal lactobacillus strains by phenotypic and genetic assays.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == use of cheese whey for biomass production and spray drying of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == the double use of cheese whey (culture medium and thermoprotectant for spray drying of lactobacilli) was explored in this study for adding value to this wastewater. in-house formulated broth (similar to mrs) and dairy media (cheese and ricotta whey and whey permeate) were assessed for their capacity to produce biomass of lactobacillus paracasei jp1, lb. rhamnosus 64 and lb. gasseri 37. simultaneously, spray drying of cheese whey-starch solution (without lactobacilli cells) was optimised using surface response methodology. cell suspensions of the  lactobacilli, produced in in house-formulated broth, were spray-dried in cheese whey-starch solution and viability monitored throughout the storage of powders for 2 months. lb. rhamnosus 64 was able to grow satisfactorily in at least two of the in-house formulated culture media and in the dairy media assessed. it also performed well in spray drying. the performance of the other strains was less satisfactory. the growth capacity, the resistance to spray drying in cheese whey-starch solution and the negligible lost in viability during the storage (2 months), makes lb. rhamnosus 64 a promising candidate for further technological studies for developing a probiotic dehydrated culture for foods, utilising wastewaters of the dairy industry (as growth substrate and protectant) and spray  drying (a low-cost widely-available technology).

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific pcr and maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to compare maldi-tof results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific pcr. methods: the 87 isolates were analyzed by maldi-tof ms (microflex lt, maldi biotyper 3.0, bruker daltonik, bremen, germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. for the identification with species-specific pcr, oligonucleotide primers (16s rrna) specific for l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri, l. plantarum, and  l. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. the pcr-products were  separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. results: for 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as l. rhamnosus, 16 as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as l. paracasei, 3 as l. gasseri, 2 as l. plantarum, and 1 as l. casei. in 4.5% of the  cases the results were discordant. of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific pcr, 1 strain was identified by maldi-tof ms as l. spec. and 1 as l. parabuchneri. one strain could not be identified by either method. conclusions: both methods are highly sensitive. limitations can be the precision  of the primers (pcr) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == the development of probiotic treatment in obesity: a review.
AB  == recent studies suggested that manipulation of the composition of the microbial ecosystem in the gut might be a novel approach in the treatment of obesity. such  treatment might consist of altering the composition of the microbial communities  of an obese individual by administration of beneficial microorganisms, commonly known as probiotics. here, we intend to contribute to the developmental process of probiotic treatment of human obesity. the aim is to review the evidence regarding the potential effect of probiotic strains on reduction of weight and body fat. a literature study was conducted focusing on clinical trials that examined the effect of specific microorganisms on body weight control. analysis of the eligible articles pointed out that lactobacillus gasseri sbt 2055, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, and the combination of l. rhamnosus atcc 53102 and bifidobacterium lactis bb12 may reduce adiposity, body weight, and weight gain. this suggests that these microbial strains can be applied in the treatment of obesity. furthermore, short chain fatty acid production and low grade inflammation were found as the underlying mechanisms of action that influence metabolism and affect body weight. these findings might contribute to the development of probiotic treatment of obesity. further research should be directed to the most effective combination and dosage rate of probiotic microorganisms.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == a comprehensive approach to determine the probiotic potential of human-derived lactobacillus for industrial use.
AB  == specific strains should only be regarded as probiotics if they fulfill certain safety, technological and functional criteria. the aim of this work was to study, from a comprehensive point of view (in vitro and in vivo tests), three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus paracasei jp1, lactobacillus rhamnosus 64 and lactobacillus gasseri 37) isolated from feces of local newborns, determining  some parameters of technological, biological and functional relevance. all strains were able to adequately grow in different economic culture media (cheese  whey, buttermilk and milk), which were also suitable as cryoprotectants. as selective media, lp-mrs was more effective than b-mrs for the enumeration of all  strains. the strains were resistant to different technological (frozen storage, high salt content) and biological (simulated gastrointestinal digestion after refrigerated storage in acidified milk, bile exposure) challenges. l. rhamnosus 64 and l. gasseri 37, in particular, were sensible to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin, increased the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophage and induced the proliferation of iga producing  cells in small intestine when administered to mice. even when clinical trails are still needed, both strains fulfilled the main criteria proposed by fao/who to consider them as potential probiotics for the formulation of new foods.

TI  == viability of microencapsulated probiotic lactobacilli during storage at different temperatures.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop technological and microbiological basics for the use of microencapsulated probiotics in meat products. probiotic lactobacillus (l.) reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei and l. gasseri strains were chosen for potential use in meat products. the effects of spices and naci on the microbiological stability were investigated in pilot studies. lyophilised samples were stored for 6 months withoud additives. microencapsulation was done with water-soluble and water-insoluble coatings. samples were stored at 2 degrees c and 20 degrees c for six months in gelatine solutions: without additives, with 5% naci, with 10% cloves and with 10% black pepper. spices and salt exhibited a strong inhibitive effect on the bacterial counts of the tested strains. during storage the lyophilised probiotic strains were stable at 2 degrees c and at 20 degrees c. protective effects of the microencapsulation however were heterogenous. although at the beginning protective effects against the antimicrobial activity of cloves were shown for l. rhamnosus, none of the tested  coatings were able to protect durably. l. paracasei proved to be very stable in general. the use of probiotic lactobacilli strains in meat products seems possible as protective effects of the microencapsulation were recognised. however, these effects must be tested for each specific application, e.g. strain/additive combination, due to individual strain differences.

TI  == inhibition of hiv and hsv infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background and the purpose of the study: the cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. methods: the in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle hiv-1 replication and hsv-2 plaque reduction assays. the xtt proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. the in vivo anti-hsv-1 activity was evaluated in balb/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. results and major conclusion: dmem culture supernatant of l. gasseri and l. fermentum (ph 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of hiv replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. co-culture of l. gasseri  (1000 cfu/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of hiv replication. the supernatant of l. crispatus inhibited 50% of hsv replication at  4% and also co-culture of l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. crispatus revokes almost all of the hsv multiplication. culture supernatants of l. gasseri and l. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the hiv and hsv and inhibited  hsv infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. alive l. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting hsv-1 infection in vivo condition. current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with  neutralizing activity against hiv and hsv and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.

TI  == screening of biofilm formation by beneficial vaginal lactobacilli and influence of culture media components.
AB  == aims: to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacilli to form biofilm under different culture conditions and to determine the relationship between their growth and the capability of biofilm formation by selected strains. methods and results: fifteen lactobacillus strains from human vagina were tested for biofilm  formation by crystal violet staining. only lactobacillus rhamnosus centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection (crl) 1332, lact. reuteri crl 1324 and lact. delbrueckii crl 1510 were able to grow and form biofilm in culture media without tween 80. however, lact. gasseri crl 1263 (a non-biofilm-forming strain) did not grow in these media. scanning electron microscopy showed that lact. rhamnosus crl 1332 and lact. reuteri crl 1324 formed a highly structured biofilm, but only lact. reuteri crl 1324 showed a high amount of extracellular material in medium without tween. conclusions: biofilm formation was significantly influenced by the strain, culture medium, inoculum concentration, microbial growth and chemical nature of the support used for the assay. significance and impacts of the study: the results allow the selection of biofilm-forming vaginal lactobacillus strains and the conditions and factors that affect this phenomenon.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

AB  == the utilization of 1-kestose (gf(2)) and nystose (gf(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (fos), by lactobacillus and bacteroides species was examined. of seven lactobacillus and five bacteroides strains that utilized fos,  l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, and l. gasseri utilized only gf(2), whereas l. acidophilus and all the bacteroides strains utilized both gf(2) and gf(3). only the strains able to utilize both gf(2) and gf(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. the culture supernatants  of the lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for gf(2) than for gf(3), whereas those of the bacteroides strains had higher activity for gf(3) than for gf(2). furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the lactobacillus cells grown in the gf(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the gf(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the bacteroides cells grown in the gf(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the gf(2) medium. these results indicate that lactobacillus species metabolize fos in a different way from that of bacteroides species.

TI  == differential targeting of the e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. however, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. probiotic bacteria  have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, and l. rhamnosus, in a t84 cell epithelial barrier model. results of dna microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as e-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr).  furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. in addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction  proteins and the abundance of protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms such as pkcdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal  diseases (e.g., ibd).

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus species in deep carious lesions of primary molars.
AB  == aim: this was to determine the prevalence of lactobacilli (lb) species in different stages of caries progression and are considered as secondary invaders of existing carious lesions and specialists for caries progression. methods: carious dentine samples were collected from 70 primary molars (m) during step-wise (s1, s2: n = 35 m) or one-step (o1: n = 35 m) caries treatment and after 11 months of temporary restorations (s3, o2). lb were identified by selected physiological and biochemical characteristics, ratio of lactic acid isomers, electrophoretic mobilities of lactic acid dehydrogenases, and shotgun mass mapping by maldi mass spectrometry. results: lb were isolated from 46% of soft dentine samples (s1). the prevalence of lb from hard dentine collected during caries excavation (o1) reached 34%, after 8 weeks of temporary filling (s2) 11%, and 9% each after 11 months of temporary restoration (s3, o2). the mean total bacterial counts (cfu) of soft dentine (s1) were 3.6 x 10(5). from hard dentine during caries excavation (o1) 4.4x10(4) cfu were calculated, at s2 3.7 x  10(3) cfu, at s3 0.1 x 10(3) cfu, and at o2 1.8 x 10(3) cfu. the percentages of lb in the cfu for lb positive dentine samples were for s1 / s2 / s3 / o1 / o2: 60% (16 m)/34% (4 m)/54% (3 m)/57% (9 m), and 64% (3 m). five lb species were identified from carious dentine: l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri, and l. alimentarius. conclusions: while l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei occurred in all caries progression stages, the other species were found only sporadically. l. paracasei  subsp. paracasei and l. rhamnosus might be the specialists of the lb in carious progression.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria colonization and clinical outcome after probiotic supplementation in conventionally treated bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
AB  == this randomized double-blind placebo controlled study assessed the vaginal colonization of lactic acid bacteria and clinical outcome. vaginal capsules containing l gasseri ln40, lactobacillus fermentum ln99, l. casei subsp. rhamnosus ln113 and p. acidilactici ln23, or placebos were administered for five  days to 95 women after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis. vulvovaginal examinations and vaginal samplings were performed before and after administration, after the first and second menstruation, and after six months. presence of ln strains was assessed using rapd analysis. ln strains were present 2-3 days after administration in 89% of the women receiving ln strains (placebo: 0%, p < 0.0001). after one menstruation  53% were colonized by at least one ln strain. nine percent were still colonized six months after administration. ninety-three percent of the women receiving ln strains were cured 2-3 days after administration (placebo: 83%), and 78% after one menstruation (placebo: 71%) (ns). the intervention group experienced less malodorous discharge 2-3 days after administration (p = 0.03) and after the second menstruation (p = 0.04), compared with placebo. in summary, five days of vaginal administration of ln strains after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis lead to vaginal colonization, somewhat  fewer recurrences and less malodorous discharge.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium adhesion and cytotoxicity during epithelial cell stress is reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == background: physiological stressors may alter susceptibility of the host intestinal epithelium to infection by enteric pathogens. in the current study, cytotoxic effect, adhesion and invasion of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) to caco-2 cells exposed to thermal stress (41 degrees c, 1 h) was investigated. probiotic bacteria have been shown to reduce interaction of pathogens with the epithelium under non-stress conditions and may  have a significant effect on epithelial viability during infection; however, probiotic effect on pathogen interaction with epithelial cells under physiological stress is not known. therefore, we investigated the influence of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus gasseri on salmonella adhesion and salmonella-induced cytotoxicity of caco-2 cells subjected to thermal stress. results: thermal stress increased the cytotoxic effect of both s. typhimurium (p  = 0.0001) and nonpathogenic e. coli k12 (p = 0.004) to caco-2 cells, and resulted in greater susceptibility of cell monolayers to s. typhimurium adhesion (p = 0.001). thermal stress had no significant impact on inflammatory cytokines released by caco-2 cells, although exposure to s. typhimurium resulted in greater than 80% increase in production of il-6 and il-8. blocking s. typhimurium with anti-shda antibody prior to exposure of salmonella decreased adhesion (p = 0.01)  to non-stressed and thermal-stressed caco-2 cells. pre-exposure of caco-2 cells to l. rhamnosus gg significantly reduced salmonella-induced cytotoxicity (p = 0.001) and salmonella adhesion (p = 0.001) to caco-2 cells during thermal stress, while l. gasseri had no effect. conclusion: results suggest that thermal stress increases susceptibility of intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells to salmonella adhesion, and increases the cytotoxic effect of salmonella during infection. use  of l. rhamnosus gg as a probiotic may reduce the severity of infection during epithelial cell stress. mechanisms by which thermal stress increases susceptibility to s. typhimurium colonization and by which l. rhamnosus gg limits the severity of infection remain to be elucidated.

AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == intra-individual diversity and similarity of salivary and faecal microbiota.
AB  == in the present study, polyphasic analysis [cultivation, combined with the fingerprinting of individual isolates, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] was applied to study whether similar features concerning  the diversity and temporal stability of selected bacterial groups could be detected intra-individually in two different niches - the oral cavity and the colon - from ten adult volunteers consuming probiotics. the predominant bacterial microbiota, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group and bifidobacterial populations, were generally stable in salivary and faecal samples, with the greater diversity seen in faeces. furthermore, different species predominated at  the two different sites. lactobacillus group dgge profiles were unstable, yet the intra-individual profiles from faecal and salivary samples collected at the same  time resembled each other. the ingested probiotic product did not affect the stability of the bacterial groups studied. the culture-based analysis showed that most subjects harboured identical indigenous lactobacillus genotypes in saliva and faeces (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum group). thus, identical indigenous lactobacilli were able to inhabit both ends of the orogastrointestinal tract, whereas the composition of the other bacterial groups studied varied between the  two sites.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. in this study we  analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. we show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between lactobacillus species. lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached  to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli  and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting  in reduced bacterial colonisation. also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of  removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

AB  == caco-2 cells (exhibiting characteristics of mature villus enterocytes) were used  to determine bacteria (salmonella enteritidis causing human gastroenteritis)-intestinal cell interactions. the interference of bacteria with  the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of filter-grown caco-2 cells and the production of il-8 after exposure of the cells to s. enteritidis 857 and/or lactobacillus strains (l. gasseri lf221 and l. rhamnosus bgt10) was evaluated. the strain 857 decreased teer of filter-grown caco-2 cells; in contrast, lactobacilli had a little or no effect. the effect of s. enteritidis on the teer  decreased if caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with lactobacilli. this strain induced high levels of il-8 (which can lead to cell damage). compared to the il-8 synthesis after exposure of caco-2 cells to s. enteritidis 857, simultaneous exposure of caco-2 cells to s. enteritidis and lactobacilli inhibited the il-8 synthesis after short recovery periods.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the cultivable lactobacillus population in adult and infant faecal material to identify strains shared across  a number of individuals. a range of lactobacilli isolated on lactobacillus-selective agar from faeces of 16 infants and 11 adults were genetically fingerprinted and further characterized by 16s rrna gene sequencing.  the relatedness of all the lactobacillus strains isolated to known species was also determined both genetically and phenotypically. this study revealed that the human intestine is initially colonized by only a few (1-2) different cultivable strains whereas in adults the pattern becomes more complex with a higher diversity of strains. the adult samples contained three genetically distinct lactobacillus strains in some cases, while infant samples generally harboured only one dominant lactobacillus strain. moreover, the species in general appeared to differ with lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus casei/paracasei found mainly in adults, whereas lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus salivarius were more commonly isolated in infant samples. the data reaffirm the differences in lactobacillus populations both between individual subjects and between the infant and adult, with an overall change in the diversity and complexity from early stages of life to adulthood.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == characterization of a new virulent phage (mlc-a) of lactobacillus paracasei.
AB  == a new virulent bacteriophage (mlc-a) was recently isolated in argentina from a probiotic dairy product containing a strain of lactobacillus paracasei. observation of the lysate with an electron microscope revealed bacteriophage particles with an icosahedral capsid of 57 +/- 2 nm; with a collar and a noncontractile tail of 156 +/- 3 nm terminating with a baseplate to which a tail  fiber was attached. therefore, phage mlc-a belongs to the siphoviridae family. this phage was able to survive the pasteurization process and was resistant to alcohols and sodium hypochlorite (400 mg/kg). only peracetic acid could inactivate high-titer suspensions of phages in a short time. the maximum rates of phage adsorption to its host cells were obtained at 30 degrees c with a ph between 5 and 7, and in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. the host range of phage mlc-a encompassed l. paracasei and lactobacillus casei strains, but it was not able to infect lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus gasseri strains.  one-step growth kinetics of its lytic development revealed latent and burst periods of 30 and 135 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 69 +/- 4 plaque-forming units per infected cell. phage mlc-a had a distinctive restriction profile when compared with the 2 well-studied lactobacillus phages, pl-1 and j-1. the genome size of the mlc-a phage was estimated to be approximately 37 kb. this  study presents the description of the first phage specific for l. paracasei isolated in argentina. the isolation of phage mlc-a indicates that, beside lactic acid bacteria starters, probiotic cultures can also be sensitive to virulent phages in industrial processes.

TI  == lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  == background: data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. methods: we examined 85 cases of lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the e-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. the clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. results: the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacillus strains was species dependent. the  considerable number of lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. of the 46 l.  rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as l. rhamnosus gg type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. mics of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/ml) for  all other species except lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. disk diffusion and e-test results were concordant. the mics of cephalosporins varied;  cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. benzylpenicillin and ampicillin mics had variable ranges between different species. combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were  receiving inadequate treatment (p=.131, by e-test). conclusion: most clinical lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low mics of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.

TI  == oral cavity as natural reservoir for intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  == ecological studies indicate that most lactobacillus species found in the human gastrointestinal tract are likely to be transient (allochthonous), originating from either the oral cavity or food. in order to investigate if oral lactobacilli constitute a part of the faecal lactobacillus biota, the lactobacillus biota of saliva and faeces of three human subjects were investigated and compared at two time-points in a 3-months interval. bacteriological culture, performed by incubation under standard (37 degrees c, anaerobic) and alternative (30 degrees c, microaerobic) conditions, as well as pcr-dgge with group-specific primers were used to characterize the predominant lactobacilli. cell counts varied among the subjects and over time, reaching up to 10(7)cfu/ml in saliva and 5 x 10(6)cfu/g in faecal samples. the species composition of the lactobacillus biota of human saliva and faeces was found to be subject-specific and fluctuated to some degree, but the species lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus vaginalis were detected at both time-points in saliva and faecal samples of individual subjects. rapd-pcr analysis indicated that several strains of these species were present both in the oral cavity and in the  faecal samples of the same subject. oral isolates of the species l. gasseri and l. vaginalis showing identical rapd types were found to persist over time, suggesting that these species are autochthonous to the oral cavity. our results together with recent published data give strong evidence that some lactobacilli found in human faeces are allochthonous to the intestine and originate from the oral cavity.

TI  == characterisation of potentially probiotic vaginal lactobacilli isolated from argentinean women.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate potentially beneficial properties of 20 strains of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from women in tucuman, argentina, by determining acid and hydrogen peroxide production and auto-aggregation ability. the microorganisms were characterised genetically by amplified ribosomal 16s-dna restriction analysis (ardra). lactobacillus gasseri and l. rhamnosus were the predominant species identified among the 20 vaginal lactobacilli strains. most achieved low ph values after 12 h incubation at 37 degrees c and produced hydrogen peroxide in static culture. however, ph decrease and semi-quantitative hydrogen peroxide production of most homofermentative lactobacilli were significantly higher than those of heterofermentative lactobacilli. of the 20 strains studied, only three demonstrated remarkable auto-aggregation patterns. four strains were selected for possible use in a probiotic product for vaginal application; however, further in vitro study of other potentially probiotic characteristics is required before attempting clinical trials.

TI  == lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether lactobacillus species found in african women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. the vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (bv), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal nigerian women, which were then gram-stained for nugent scoring. microbial dna was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). lactobacillus species were identified by dna sequencing and blast algorithm. results: of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had pcr products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the bv nugent scores. on sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. most women (64%) were colonized by l. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in canadian and swedish women. l. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by l. plantarum, l. suntoryeus, l. crispatus, l. rhamnosus, and other species. conclusion: the findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from northern countries.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of swedish infants.
AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

AB  == the efficacy of a biochemical kit, api50chl kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results  of dna-dna hybridization assay. the results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. especially all strains of some species, such as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. however, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. this suggests that the exact identification of lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by api50chl kit is  difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), lact. rhamnosus (six strains), lact. gasseri (three strains), lact. acidophilus (one strain) and lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to sds-page of whole cell proteins and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. results obtained by rrna probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to lact. reuteri. isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.

TI  == the effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  == four common lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. mice received perorally 10(9) viable  bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and b-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (by 27-28%). conversely, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited  both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation,  particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin a (by 43-68%) and lps (by 23-62%). therefore, these lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on b- and t-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == [protein fingerprinting as a method for strain-specific differentiation of technologically useful lactobacillus strains from clinical isolates].
AB  == lactobacilli are often used in products of animal origin because of their technological properties and as protective cultures against pathogenic microorganisms, however they are supposed to be related to human infections as well. therefore 39 strains of species that are in biotechnological usage, including the type strains, and some clinical isolates were investigated. 9 strains of l. acidophilus, 7 of l. gasseri and 23 strains of l. rhamnosus were tested. biochemical and physiological properties were proved by classical tests.  analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic protein patterns was performed with diamine silver staining, a technique not previously applied to lactobacilli. classical tests were able to confirm all strains as belonging to one of the three species. analysis of protein patterns allowed to differentiate between strains of the same species. in case of l. acidophilus biotechnologically used strains and clinical isolates were clustered separately. l. rhamnosus formed three clusters.  sds-page of proteins together with diamine silver staining seems to be helpful to detect intra-species differences. it was stated, that technologically used strains of lactobacilli could clearly be differentiated from another and also from clinical isolates.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
