TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
