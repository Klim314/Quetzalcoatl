TI  == mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) in clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mics, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in tokyo, japan, in 2000 and 2001. the resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, n. gonorrhoeae atcc 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (pena) that had been amplified by pcr from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (mic, 0.5  micro g/ml). the sequences of pena in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported n. gonorrhoeae pena gene sequences. some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this pena gene were similar to those in the pena genes of neisseria perflava (n. sicca), neisseria cinerea, neisseria flavescens, and neisseria meningitidis. these results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the pena gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of n. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for n. meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == the bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. eye prophylaxis study  group.
AB  == the authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. from 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for  60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. the following isolates were categorized as pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria cinerea, klebsiella pneumoniae, and chlamydia trachomatis. using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (or) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.3-128). among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology  of infant conjunctivitis, streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (or = 5.3, 95% ci 1.8-15.0).  the findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.
