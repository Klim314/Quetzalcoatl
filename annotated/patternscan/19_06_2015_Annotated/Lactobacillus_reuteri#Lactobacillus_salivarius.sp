TI  == characterization of the effects of three lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to  do so. the present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. a chicken macrophage cell line, mq-ncsu, was co-cultured with the three live lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. l. acidophilus and l. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (no) production and phagocytosis, while l. reuteri did not. in fact, l reuteri was shown to inhibit no production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with lps. the results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of l. acidophilus and l. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of l. reuteri.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == characterization of some potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from iranian native chickens.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterize new  lab strains with high probiotic potentials from iranian (isfahan) indigenous chickens. from 90 isolated labs, 11 isolates had high growth rate under different stress conditions, including acid (ph 2.5), bile (0.5% oxgall), salt (6-15%) and  temperatures 15 and 45 degrees c, and their aggregation time was less than 120 min. based on the molecular identification using 16s rdna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to two lactobacillus salivarius and  l. reuteri species. the isolates showed different tolerance to 16 clinically and  veterinary relevant antibiotics, and most of them were resistant to or semi-tolerant of 7-15 different studied antibiotics. the es11, es12, es3 and es13 strains with resistance to or semi-tolerance of 15, 14 and 13 different antibiotics, respectively, were the most tolerant strains. the selected isolates  showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 7 different pathogenic strains. all the isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against e. coli, enterococcus hirae, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus. the isolates es6 and es11 with high antagonistic activity and resistance against 6 of the studied pathogens were the most powerful antagonistic isolates. the values and types of adhesion to the caco-2 cell cultures were significantly different (0-40  bacteria/caco-2 cell), and the maximum adhesion was observed for the isolates es6 and es13 with 35 and 40 bacteria adhesion/cell, respectively. finally, based on all the experiments, 7 strains, including es1, es6, es7, es11, es12 and es13, were selected for the further in vivo assays and possible use in the poultry industry.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the safety and probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from chicken and calves.
AB  == a total of 73 chicken and calves isolates were diagnosed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). after a preliminary subtractive screening based on the high acid tolerance at ph  2.5 and bile resistance at 0.3% oxgall, twenty isolates belonging to the species  lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus amylovorus were in vitro screened for the safety assessment and probiotic properties, including antibiotics susceptibility  patterns, biochemical activity and potential for competitive exclusion of biofilm producing pathogens determined by crystal violet and/or quantitative fluorescent  in situ hybridisation (fish) assays utilizing 5'cy 3 labelled probe enter1432 for enteric group. antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the iso norm 10932. the sixteen strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents, except for two chicken (l. salivarius 12k, l. agilis 13k) and two calves  (l. reuteri l10/1, l. murinus l9) isolates with the presence non wild-type ecoffs (epidemiological cut-off) for gentamicin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)), tetracycline (>/=128 mug ml(-1)), kanamycin (>/=256 mug ml(-1)) and streptomycin (>/=96 mug ml(-1)). the two referenced chicken isolates gave positive aac(6')ie-aph(2'')ia and tet(l) pcr results. the wild-type ecoffs isolates were subjected to the apizym analysis for enzyme profile evaluation and amino acid decarboxylase activities determined by qualitative plate method and multiplex pcr for the detection of four genes involved in the production of histamine (histidine decarboxylase, hdc), tyramine (tyrosine decarboxylase, tyrdc) and putrescine (via eithers ornithine decarboxylase, odc, or agmatine deiminase, agdi). from examined strains only two chicken isolates (l. reuteri 14k; l. salivarius 15k) had no harmful beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase activities connected with detrimental effects in the gastrointestinal tract and together no amino acid decarboxylase activities and no genes associated with biogenic amines production  though only chicken l. salivarius 15k whole cells and acid supernatants shown strong suppressive potential against biofilm-forming klebsiella and escherichia coli. our results highlight that above-mentioned isolate l. salivarius 15k fulfils the principle requirements of a qualified probiotic and may be seen as a  reliable candidate for further validation studies in chicken.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
AB  == thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of  inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the  c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.

TI  == fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity in wild-type strains of lactobacillus, isolated from the intestinal tract of pigs.
AB  == phosphoketolases are key enzymes of the phosphoketolase pathway of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, which include lactobacilli. in heterofermentative lactobacilli xylulose 5-phosphate phosphoketolase (x5ppk) is the main enzyme of the phosphoketolase pathway. however, activity of fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) has always been considered absent in lactic acid bacteria. in this study, the f6ppk activity was detected in 24 porcine wild-type strains of lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus mucosae, but not in  the lactobacillus salivarius or in l. reuteri atcc strains. the activity of f6ppk increased after treatment of the culture at low-ph and diminished after porcine bile-salts stress conditions in wild-type strains of l. reuteri. colorimetric quantification at 505 nm allowed to differentiate between microbial strains with  low activity and without the activity of f6ppk. additionally, activity of f6ppk and the x5ppk gene expression levels were evaluated by real time pcr, under stress and nonstress conditions, in 3 l. reuteri strains. although an exact correlation, between enzyme activity and gene expression was not obtained, it remains possible that the xpk gene codes for a phosphoketolase with dual substrate, at least in the analyzed strains of l. reuteri.

TI  == differential cytokine expression in t-cell subsets of chicken caecal tonsils co-cultured with three species of lactobacillus.
AB  == members of the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the development of t-cells. little is known about responses of intestinal t-cell subsets of chickens to commensal bacteria. therefore, we set out to characterise cytokine responses in t-cells after exposure to lactobacilli. caecal tonsil mononuclear cells were isolated and co-cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius for 12 hours. subsequently the cd4+ and cd8+ cells were fractionated by flow cytometry and the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as toll-like receptor 21 (tlr21) was determined. the results demonstrated that chicken cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells express tlr21 and that the various isolates of lactobacilli differentially induces the expression of interleukin 10, interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor beta. our results demonstrate that different lactobacillus species have the capacity to regulate intestinal t-cell responses and that these responses may be  important to intestinal homeostasis.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans include possible antitumor activity.
AB  == this study examined the effects of three lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, and pediococcus acidilactici were found to inhibit the development and growth of the worm. compared to escherichia coli used as the control, l. reuteri  and p. acidilactici reduced the lifespan of wild-type and short-lived daf-16 worms. on the contrary, l. salivarius extended the lifespan of daf-16 worms when  used live, but reduced it as uv-killed bacteria. the three lab induced the expression of genes involved in pathogen response and inhibited the growth of tumor-like germ cells, without affecting daf16 localization or increasing corpse  cells. our results suggest the possible use of c. elegans as a model for studying the antitumor attributes of lab. the negative effects of these lab strains on the nematode also indicate their potential use against parasitic nematodes.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated during traditional fura processing in ghana.
AB  == fura is a millet-based spontaneously fermented dumpling produced and consumed in  parts of west africa, particularly nigeria, burkina faso and ghana. from eight traditional fura production sites in northern ghana, 862 lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified to species level using a combination of genotypic and phenotypic methods including (gtg)(5)-based pcr fingerprinting and 16s rrna gene sequencing, multiplex pcr by means of reca gene sequence comparison, conventional morphological characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profiling. during millet dough fermentation, ph decreased from 5.6-6.4 to 4.1-3.7 and total lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts increased from 4.4-5.3 to 7.9-9.2 log(10) (cfu/g). the initial stages of the fermentation were characterized by co-dominance of homo- and heterofermentative species of pediococcus acidilactici, weisella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus paraplantarum whereas l. fermentum was dominating at the end of the fermentation. l. fermentum was predominant in all fermentations (p < 0.05) and a high uniformity was observed among production sites regarding the dominance of l. fermentum. l. fermentum and w. confusa were isolated in all production sites and almost at all fermentation stages indicating that they are indigenous to traditional fura processing. the other lab bacteria species which comprised a minor proportion of the total lab occurred occasionally and in an irregular pattern among the production sites.

TI  == evaluating the efficacy of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization of campylobacter jejuni in broiler chickens.
AB  == campylobacteriosis is the most frequent zoonotic disease in humans worldwide, and the contaminated poultry meat by campylobacter jejuni can be considered one of the important sources of enteric infections in humans. the use of probiotics, which can help to improve the natural defense of animals against pathogenic bacteria, is an alternative and effective approach to antibiotic administration for livestock to reduce bacterial contamination. in vitro experiments showed that enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus reuteri isolated from healthy chicken gut inhibited the growth of c. jejuni. to demonstrate this effect in vivo, 1-d-old broiler chicks received 2  mg/bird per day of a multispecies probiotic product via the drinking water. controls received no probiotic treatment, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. results showed that the cecal colonization by c. jejuni was significantly reduced by probiotic treatment at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. to confirm this effect, in a second in vivo experiment, 1-d-old broiler chicks received the same dose of the same probiotic via the drinking water and controls  received no probiotic, and all chicks were infected with c. jejuni orally. similarly, probiotic treatment reduced (p=0.001) cecal colonization by c. jejuni  at both 8 and 15 d postchallenge. the results of our in vivo experiments conclude that probiotic administration reduced the colonization of c. jejuni in broiler chickens.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == comparative evaluation of three lactobacilli with strain-specific activities for  rats when supplied in drinking water.
AB  == to test the in vivo benefits of three lactobacilli and to compare their different efficacies based on strain-specific activities by using rats as an experimental model, a growth-promotion and a challenge trial were conducted. the three strains, lactobacillus salivarius g1-1, lactobacillus reuteri g22-2, and lactobacillus reuteri g8-5 shared antimicrobial, bile-salt-hydrolase and amylolytic activities in vitro, respectively. in the 17 day growth-promotion trial, 48 rats were allotted to four treatments with 12 replicates per treatment: a control group, which received saline, as well as three experimental groups, which received 10(8) cells/ml of one of the three lactobacilli in saline suspension. the results showed that compared with the control group, l. reuteri g8-5 significantly improved feed efficiency and decreased fecal ph values on days 8 and 17, concomitant with reduced faecal coliform counts on d 17 (p < 0.05). all treatments with lactobacilli caused an increase in the moisture content of the faeces and a decrease in the serum total cholesterol and blood urea nitrogen levels. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was only elevated for rats which received l. reuteri g22-2. in the salmonella-challenge trial, 40 rats were allotted to five treatments (8 replicates per treatment) which consisted of a positive control (infected, no lactobacillus pretreatment), a negative control (uninfected, no lactobacillus pretreatment) and three lactobacillus-pretreated groups (10(9) cells/ml in saline). the results showed that rats in all lactobacillus pretreated groups were protected from infection with significantly  higher weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency compared with positive control rats (p < 0.05). rats treated with l. salivarius g1-1 and l. reuteri g22-2 tended to exhibit higher weight gains than those pretreated with l. reuteri g8-5. significantly lower salmonella shedding in faeces, salmonella numbers in the spleen and the relative weight of the spleen were observed in the lactobacillus groups (p < 0.05). based on the overall results, it can be concluded that not all strains within the same lactobacilli species show similar  effects and that some of the beneficial functionalities to animals were strain-specific. therefore strains for practical application need to be carefully selected based on their strain-specific characters.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri protects epidermal keratinocytes from staphylococcus aureus-induced cell death by competitive exclusion.
AB  == recent studies have suggested that the topical application of probiotic bacteria  can improve skin health or combat disease. we have utilized a primary human keratinocyte culture model to investigate whether probiotic bacteria can inhibit  staphylococcus aureus infection. evaluation of the candidate probiotics lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730, lactobacillus rhamnosus ac413, and lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 demonstrated that both l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus, but not l. salivarius, reduced s. aureus-induced keratinocyte cell death in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. keratinocyte survival was significantly higher if the probiotic was applied prior to (p < 0.01) or simultaneously with (p < 0.01) infection with s. aureus but not when added after infection had commenced (p > 0.05). the protective effect of l. reuteri was not dependent on the elaboration of inhibitory substances such as lactic acid. l. reuteri inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion (p = 0.026). l. salivarius ucc118, however, did not inhibit s. aureus from adhering to keratinocytes (p > 0.05) and did not protect keratinocyte viability. s. aureus utilizes the alpha5beta1 integrin to adhere to  keratinocytes, and blocking of this integrin resulted in a protective effect similar to that observed with probiotics (p = 0.03). this suggests that the protective mechanism for l. reuteri-mediated protection of keratinocytes was by competitive exclusion of the pathogen from its binding sites on the cells. our results suggest that use of a topical probiotic prophylactically could inhibit the colonization of skin by s. aureus and thus aid in the prevention of infection.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. thirty-seven lactobacillus spp. strains isolated  from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in de man, rogosa and sharpe broth in a microplate assay. almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the lactobacillus acidophilus group) and  to tetracycline (mic>/=128 mug/ml). only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. the transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using l. acidophilus strain 4m14e (emr), lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5m14e (cmr), lactobacillus salivarius strain 5c14c (emr), and the 4g14l and 3c14c strains of lactobacillus reuteri (cmr) showed a frequency of  approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different  combinations. the exception was the l. salivarius 5c14c (emr) and l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. in vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating l. acidophilus 4m14e (emr) with l. reuteri 3c14c (cmr), l. reuteri 4g14l (cmr) or l. vaginalis 5m14e (cmr) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. this possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == discrimination of probiotic lactobacillus strains for poultry by repetitive sequenced-based pcr fingerprinting.
AB  == background: four repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) methods, namely repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr), polytrinucleotide (gtg)5 -pcr and box-pcr, were evaluated for the molecular differentiation of 12 probiotic lactobacillus strains previously isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens and used as a multistrain probiotic. this study represents the  first analysis of the comparative efficacy of these four rep-pcr methods and their combination (composite rep-pcr) in the molecular typing of lactobacillus strains based on a discriminatory index (d). results: species-specific and strain-specific profiles were observed from rep-pcr. from the numerical analysis  of composite rep-pcr, box-pcr, (gtg)5 -pcr, rep-pcr and eric-pcr, d values of 0.9118, 0.9044, 0.8897, 0.8750 and 0.8529 respectively were obtained. composite rep-pcr analysis was the most discriminative method, with eight lactobacillus strains, namely l. brevis atcc 14869(t) , l. reuteri c 10, l. reuteri atcc 23272(t) , l. gallinarum atcc 33199(t) , l. salivarius atcc 11741(t) , l. salivarius i 24, l. panis jcm 11053(t) and l. panis c 17, being differentiated at the strain level. conclusion: composite rep-pcr analysis is potentially a useful  fingerprinting method to discriminate probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == methodological issues in randomized trials assessing probiotics for periodontal treatment.
AB  == background and objective: probiotics traditionally used in medicine field are now being used in an attempt to control and treat periodontal disease. however, the trials used to analyze the effects of probiotics have been subject to methodological criticism. the aim of this review was to assess the methodological deficiencies in randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral administration of probiotics for the treatment of periodontal disease. material and methods: a manual and electronic literature search (of medline and the cochrane library) was made, to march 2011, for randomized controlled trials presenting clinical, microbiological, immunological and patient-centered data for the efficacy of probiotics compared with a placebo/standard periodontal therapy for the treatment of periodontal disease. results: the literature search yielded  only four randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the  efficacy of probiotics (using lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius  probiotic strains) in patients with gingivitis. the studies were too methodologically flawed (of mediocre quality) with a high risk of bias for any meaningful conclusions to be reached. these studies lacked adequate descriptions  of appropriate randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, formulation and dosage of probiotic and placebo, extent and severity of periodontal disease in patient populations, patient-centered outcomes, results data and potential confounding factors. conclusion: the existing randomized controlled trials have important methodological limitations; consequently, there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of probiotics in treating periodontal disease. more rigorous scientific research, in accordance with existing guidelines and research recommendations of the present review, is required to examine the safety and efficacy of probiotics before they are embraced in periodontal therapy.

TI  == oral treatment of chickens with lactobacilli influences elicitation of immune responses.
AB  == commensal microbes in the intestine are in constant interaction with host cells and play a role in shaping the immune system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius are members of the chicken intestinal microbiota and have been shown to induce different cytokine profiles in mononuclear cells in vitro. the objective of the present study was to examine  the effects of these bacteria individually or in combination on the induction of  antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. the birds received lactobacilli weekly via oral gavage starting on day of hatch and subsequently, at 14 and 21 days, were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc), keyhole limpet  hemocyanin (klh), newcastle disease virus vaccine, and infectious bursal disease  virus vaccine. antibody responses in serum were measured weekly for 4 weeks beginning on the day of primary immunization. the cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at 21 days postimmunization by measurement of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) production in splenocytes stimulated with inactivated vaccine antigens. l. salivarius-treated birds had significantly more serum antibody to srbc and klh than birds that were not treated with probiotics. l. salivarius-treated birds also had decreased cell-mediated immune responses to recall antigen stimulation. l. reuteri treatment did not significantly affect the systemic immune response, while l. acidophilus treatment increased the antibody response to klh. these results indicate that systemic antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses can be modulated by oral treatment with lactobacilli but that these bacteria may vary in their ability to modulate the immune response.

TI  == lactobacilli antagonize the growth, motility, and adherence of brachyspira pilosicoli: a potential intervention against avian intestinal spirochetosis.
AB  == avian intestinal spirochetosis (ais) results from the colonization of the ceca and colorectum of poultry by pathogenic brachyspira species. the number of cases  of ais has increased since the 2006 european union ban on the use of antibiotic growth promoters, which, together with emerging antimicrobial resistance in brachyspira, has driven renewed interest in alternative intervention strategies.  probiotics have been reported as protecting livestock against infection with common enteric pathogens, and here we investigate which aspects of the biology of brachyspira they antagonize in order to identify possible interventions against ais. the cell-free supernatants (cfs) of two lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus reuteri lm1 and lactobacillus salivarius lm2, suppressed the growth of brachyspira pilosicoli b2904 in a ph-dependent manner. in in vitro adherence and  invasion assays with ht29-16e three-dimensional (3d) cells and in a novel avian cecal in vitro organ culture (ivoc) model, the adherence and invasion of b. pilosicoli in epithelial cells were reduced significantly by the presence of lactobacilli (p < 0.001). in addition, live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli inhibited the motility of b. pilosicoli, and electron microscopic observations indicated that contact between the lactobacilli and brachyspira was crucial in inhibiting both adherence and motility. these data suggest that motility is essential for b. pilosicoli to adhere to and invade the gut epithelium and that any interference of motility may be a useful tool for the development of control  strategies.

TI  == effect of glutathione on growth of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is an abundant nonprotein thiol that plays numerous roles within the cell. previously, we showed that lactobacillus salivarius has the capacity to mount a glutathione-mediated acid-tolerance response. in the present  work we provide evidence of a requirement for gsh by lactobacillus reuteri and have studied the role of gsh during cell growth. medium supplementation with 0.5  mm gsh as the sole sulfur source enhanced cell growth, resulting in an increase in glucose consumption, and increased cell gsh and protein contents compared with levels seen in the absence of supplementation. moreover, l. reuteri showed enhanced amino acid consumption when grown with 0.5 mm gsh. these findings indicate that glutathione is a nutrient for bacterial growth.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == luminal administration ex vivo of a live lactobacillus species moderates mouse jejunal motility within minutes.
AB  == gut commensals modulate host immune, endocrine, and metabolic functions. they also affect peripheral and central neural reflexes and function. we have previously shown that daily ingestion of lactobacillus reuteri (lr) for 9 d inhibits the pseudoaffective cardiac response and spinal single-fiber discharge evoked by visceral distension, and decreases intestinal motility and myenteric ah cell slow afterhyperpolarization (sahp) by inhibiting a ca-activated k (ik(ca)) channel. we tested whether luminal lr could acutely decrease motility in an ex vivo perfusion model of naive balb/c jejunum. live lr dose dependently decreased  motor complex pressure wave amplitudes with 9- to 16-min onset latency and an ic(50) of 5 x 10(7) cells/ml krebs. heat-killed lr or another live commensal, lactobacillus salivarius, were without effect. the ik(ca) channel blocker tram-34, but neither the opener (dcebio) nor the hyperpolarization-activated cationic channel inhibitor zd7288 (5 mum) (or ttx 1 mum), mimicked the lr effect  on motility acutely ex vivo. we provide evidence for a rapid, strain-specific, dose-dependent action of a live lactobacillus on small intestinal motility reflexes that recapitulates the long-term effects of lr ingestion. these observations may be useful as a first step to unraveling the pathways involved in bacteria to the nervous system communication.

TI  == bile salt deconjugation and cholesterol removal from media by lactobacillus strains used as probiotics in chickens.
AB  == background: bile salt deconjugation by lactobacillus strains is often closely linked to bile tolerance and survival of the strains in the gut and lowering of cholesterol in the host. the present study investigated the deconjugation of bile salts and removal of cholesterol by 12 lactobacillus strains in vitro. the 12 strains were previously isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. results: the 12 lactobacillus strains could deconjugate sodium glycocholate (gca, 16.87-100%) and sodium taurocholate (tca, 1.69-57.43%) bile salts to varying degrees, with all strains except l. salivarius i 24 having a higher affinity for  gca. the 12 lactobacillus strains also showed significant (p < 0.05) differences  in their ability to remove cholesterol from the growth medium (26.74-85.41%). significant (p < 0.05) correlations were observed between cholesterol removal and deconjugation of tca (r = 0.83) among the l. reuteri strains (c1, c10 and c16) and between cholesterol removal and deconjugation of tca (r = 0.38) and gca (r =  0.70) among the l. brevis strains (i 12, i 23, i 25, i 211 and i 218). in contrast, although l. gallinarum i 16 and i 26 and l. panis c 17 showed high deconjugating activity, there was no correlation between cholesterol removal and  deconjugation of bile salts in these strains. conclusion: the results showed that the 12 lactobacillus strains were able to deconjugate bile salts and remove cholesterol in vitro, but not all strains with high deconjugating activity removed cholesterol effectively.

TI  == screening lactic acid bacteria from swine origins for multistrain probiotics based on in vitro functional properties.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria originated from swine feces and intestines were selected for potential probiotics based on their bile-salt resistance, low ph tolerance, potential adhesion to epithelial cells and especially functional properties, including production of antimicrobial substances, bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) and amylolytic activity. results showed 7 isolates with antimicrobial activity, 5 with bsh activity and 3 with amylolytic activity were preliminarily selected from 485 lactic acid bacteria based on their highest potential with functional properties in vitro. the 15 isolates were further assayed on the essential characteristics as potential probiotics. all isolates were fully tolerant to 0.3% bile salts and 11 of them were able to resist ph 3 for 3 h without loss of viable cells. the eleven isolates were then evaluated on their adhesion capability. wide variation in the hydrophobic character and specific adhesion efficiency was observed and three isolates g1-1, g22-2 and g8-5, with respective antimicrobial,  bsh and amylolytic activities were finally selected. in addition, the three isolates were compatible in the coexistence assay. isolate g1-1 was identified as lactobacillus salivarius by api system and a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. both g8-5 and g22-2 showed the closest homology to lactobacillus reuteri according to their 16s rrna gene sequences (99%). from the study, the three lactobacilli strains were shown to share the functional properties necessary for  probiotics use in animal additives. their compatibility with respective in vitro  activities was expected to show enhanced in vivo efficacy after combination for multistrain probiotics use.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

AB  == probiotics might be one of the solutions to reduce the effects of the recent ban  on antimicrobial growth promoters in feed. however, the mode of action of probiotics still not fully understood. therefore, evaluating probiotics (microbial feed additives) is essential. thus the objective of this work was to investigate the efficacy of a new microbial feed additive (lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri) in broiler nutrition. the body weight (bw), average daily weight gain was relatively increased by the dietary inclusion of lactobacillus sp. in broiler diets. furthermore, the lactobacillus feed additive  influenced the histomorphological measurements of small intestinal villi. the addition of lactobacillus sp. increased (p < 0.05) the villus height (vh)/crypt depth ratio and the vh was numerically increased in duodenum. the duodenal crypt  depth remained unaffected (p > 0.05), while the ileal crypt depth was decreased by dietary supplementation of lactobacillus sp. compared with the control. at the end of the feeding period, the basal and glucose stimulated short-circuit current (isc) and electrical tissue conductivity were measured in the isolated gut mucosa to characterize the electrical properties of the gut. the addition of glucose on  the mucosal side in ussing chamber produced a significant increase (p = 0.001) in isc in both jejunum and colon relative to the basal values in lactobacillus probiotic group. this increase in isc for probiotic group in jejunum is equivalent to an increase of about two times that for the basal values, while in  the control group is about half fold that for the basal value. in addition, the deltaisc after glucose addition to the large intestine was greater than the deltaisc in the small intestine in both control and probiotic group. moreover in  both jejunum and colon, the increase in isc for birds fed lactobacillus was higher than their control counterparts (p < or = 0.1). this result suggests that  the addition of lactobacillus sp. to broiler diets increased the glucose transport. additionally, the results indicated that the conductivity of jejunal and colonic tissues remained unaffected by the dietary inclusion of lactobacillus and support the concept that this additive enhances the maintenance and function  of the epithelial barrier. in conclusion, dietary inclusion of a microbial feed additive (l. salivarius and l. reuteri) slightly increased the growth performance and improved intestinal nutrient absorption which was in association with the intestinal architecture improvement.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of porcine bacteria that inhibit  the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae in vitro.
AB  == aims: to identify bacilli, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria that inhibit the growth of brachyspira hyodysenteriae. methods and results: a total of 80 isolates were obtained from various porcine intestinal compartments using selective conditions and grouped into 15 similarity clusters based on whole-cell  protein profiles. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr patterns identified 24 genotypes. 16s rdna sequencing assigned all genotypes, except eight aerobes, to established species (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, bifidobacterium thermophilum). according to their minimum inhibitory  concentrations, four strains (ent. faecium, lact. reuteri, lact. amylovorus, bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(b) determinant. a cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. the brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of lact. salivarius, bif. thermophilum, ent. faecium and b. subtilis. conclusions: three porcine strains of ent. faecium, bif. thermophilum and b. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity. significance and impact of the study: for the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. these findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed  additives for prevention of swine dysentery.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus isolates originating from porcine intestine and feces.
AB  == in this study, a total of 94 lactic acid bacterial (lab) isolates of porcine small intestinal and fecal origin were screened for their probiotic properties. the aim was to evaluate whether their isolation site and putative species identity play a role in these characteristics and whether either of these can be  used as a predictive factor for the probiotic potential of bacterial isolates. the isolates were preliminarily identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing and characterized in vitro for their ph and bile tolerance, adhesion capacity towards porcine enterocytes isolated from five intestinal sites and for antimicrobial activity towards five indicator pathogens. the interdependence of these characteristics was statistically evaluated. the isolates tolerated low ph  and bile well. adherence to the enterocytes of different origins did not correlate with the strain isolation site. in general, higher adherence was observed to colon cells in comparison to the small intestinal enterocytes. culture filtrates of the isolates caused a decrease of up to three orders of magnitude in the intestinal pathogen cell numbers. the inhibition was mostly due  to lactic and other organic acids. the predominating phylotypes identified were lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius, of which the former generally had the best adhesion capacity, whereas the latter appeared to be the best inhibitor. based on the results, several strains of the pig lactobacillus isolates tested may function as promising candidates for use in probiotic products. however, it was not possible to use the isolation site or the species identity of the isolates as reliable preliminary screening factors.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli from sow milk and evaluation of their probiotic potential.
AB  == sow milk protects the piglet against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. in this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in this biological fluid was investigated. milk samples were obtained from 8 sows and a total of 19 rod-shaped isolates were selected for identification and assessment of their probiotic potential. rapd profiling revealed the existence of 8 different genetic profiles among them. one representative of each profile was selected for further characterization and they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri, lb. salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. paraplantarum, lb. brevis and weissella paramesenteroides. then, their probiotic  potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. three strains, lb. reuteri cr20 (a reuterin-producing strain), lb. salivarius cela2 (a  bacteriocin-producing strain) and lb. paraplantarum clb7 displayed the highest probiotic potential.

TI  == isolation of lactobacilli with probiotic properties from the human stomach.
AB  == aims: recent evidence suggests that the human gastric microbiota is much more diverse than previously thought. the aim of this study was to assess the potential for isolating lactobacilli from the human stomach. methods and results: lactobacilli were selectively cultured from gastric biopsies from 12 patients undergoing routine endoscopy. lactobacilli were present in four of 12 biopsies. we isolated, in total 10 different strains representing five species (lactobacillus gasseri, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis, l. reuteri and l. salivarius). the 10 isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of two gram-positive bacteria and two gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, the acid and bile resistance profiles of the 10 isolates spanned a wide range. conclusions: five different lactobacillus species were cultured from human gastric biopsies for the first time. significance and impact of the study: diverse lactobacillus species are more prevalent in the human stomach than previously recognized, representing an untapped source of bacteria with beneficial probiotic and/or biotechnological properties.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == estimation of 16s rrna gene copy number in several probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == the copy numbers of 16s rrna genes in 12 probiotic lactobacillus strains of poultry origin were analyzed. genomic dna of the strains was digested with restriction endonucleases that do not cut within the 16s rrna gene of the strains. this was followed by southern hybridization with a biotinylated probe complementary to the 16s rrna gene. the copy number of the 16s rrna gene within a lactobacillus species was found to be conserved. from the hybridization results,  lactobacillus salivarius i 24 was estimated to have seven copies of the 16s rrna  gene, lactobacillus panis c 17 to have five copies and lactobacillus gallinarum strains i 16 and i 26 four copies. the 16s rrna gene copy numbers of l. gallinarum and l. panis reported in the present study are the first record. lactobacillus brevis strains i 12, i 23, i 25, i 211, i 218 and lactobacillus reuteri strains c 1, c 10, c 16 were estimated to have at least four copies of the 16s rrna gene. in addition, distinct rrna restriction patterns which could discriminate the strains of l. reuteri and l. gallinarum were also detected. information on 16s rrna gene copy number is important for physiological, evolutionary and population studies of the bacteria.

TI  == detection of t lymphocytes in intestine of broiler chicks treated with lactobacillus spp. and challenged with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.
AB  == the expression of immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+ cells in the epithelium and in the intestinal lamina propria of chicks was studied in the present work by means of immunohistochemical reaction.  the chicks were treated with lactobacillus spp. or cecal microflora (cm) and experimentally challenged or not with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. the 320 birds utilized were divided into 4 groups containing 80 chicks each and submitted to treatments with lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus, and cm. each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of  20 birds each and classified into a subgroup that did not receive treatment (negative control), subgroup treated, subgroup treated and challenged with salmonella enteritidis, and subgroup only challenged with salmonella enteritidis  (positive control). the results obtained show that the treatment with l. reuteri, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis determine immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+ and cd8+ lymphocytes followed by cd4+ in the epithelium and in the lamina propria of the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicks up to 12 d of age. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the intestine of chicks treated with l. acidophilus or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis; however, the higher quantity of cd8+ lymphocytes was in the intestine of chicks treated with cm and challenged with salmonella enteritidis. the duodenum was the segment in which the immune response by t cells (cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+) was stimulated with the greatest intensity, followed by, respectively,  the jejunum and cecum. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes present in the duodenum,  jejunum, and cecum increases with the age of chicks, independent of the stimulus  determined by treatments or challenge.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == identification of the most abundant lactobacillus species in the crop of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens.
AB  == bacteria from crops of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens fed with two brands (diets a and b) of wheat-based diets were isolated on lactobacillus-selective medium and identified (n = 300) based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence. the most abundant lactobacillus species were l. reuteri (33%), l. crispatus (18.7%), and l. salivarius (13.3%). regardless of farm and feed, l. reuteri was the most abundant species (p < 0.005) in the crops of the younger chickens. however, the amount of l. reuteri was significantly reduced in the crops of the 5-week-old chickens regardless of the feed (p = 0.016). the diversity of l. reuteri isolates was studied by fatty acid analysis, and the 94 l. reuteri isolates could be arranged into several clusters. the nisin sensitivities of the l. reuteri isolates were determined because nisin is a candidate coccidiostat. sensitive isolates were found more frequently in younger chickens (77%) than in 5-week-old  chickens (23%), whereas chickens fed with commercial feed b had a higher proportion of nisin-resistant isolates (73%) than did chickens fed with feed a (45%). nisin-resistant strains are potential candidates for adjunct cultures for  maintaining l. reuteri in its natural niche in the crop and are potential targets for genetic engineering with nisin-selectable food-grade vectors. the diversity of the l. reuteri population suggested that one should consider including several strains representing different clusters and nisin resistance phenotypes in candidate probiotic feed supplements for chickens.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == cloacal lactobacillus isolates from broilers often display resistance toward tetracycline antibiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus, l. reuteri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius strains isolated from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 20 different farms in belgium were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline. acquired resistance percentages to these antibiotics were extremely high for l. crispatus, l. reuteri, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius (75%-100%). l. amylovorus on the  contrary, displayed lower resistance percentages (25%) toward minocycline and tetracycline. in several strains, resistance against the tetracycline antibiotics was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(k), tet(l), tet(m),  tet(w), and tet(z). to our knowledge, this is the first report of tet(z) in lactobacilli and tet(k), tet(l), and tet(w) in lactobacilli identified to species level. our findings strengthen the evidence of intestinal lactobacillus species acting as a pool of antimicrobial resistance genes urging the need for prudent use of tetracycline antibiotics in poultry production.

TI  == oral treatment with live lactobacillus reuteri inhibits the allergic airway response in mice.
AB  == rationale: clinical trials have demonstrated that probiotics may be effective in  the treatment and prevention of atopic disease in children but there have been few reports of therapeutic effects of oral probiotics outside the gastrointestinal tract. objectives: we investigated the effect of two probiotic organisms on the response to antigen challenge in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. methods: we used an ovalbumin-sensitized asthma model in balb/c and toll-like receptor 9-deficient mice. animals were treated with probiotic organisms via gavaging needle before antigen challenge. after antigen challenge, airway responsiveness to methacholine, influx of inflammatory cells to the lung, and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed. results: oral treatment with live lactobacillus reuteri but not lactobacillus salivarius significantly attenuated the influx of eosinophils to the airway lumen and parenchyma and reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, il-5, and il-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of antigen-challenged animals, but there was no change in eotaxin or il-10. l. reuteri but not l. salivarius also decreased allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. these responses were dependent on toll-like receptor 9 and were associated with increased activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. killed organisms did not mimic the ability of the live l. reuteri to attenuate inflammation or airway hyperresponsiveness. conclusion: oral treatment with live  l. reuteri can attenuate major characteristics of an asthmatic response in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. these results suggest that oral treatment with specific live probiotic strains may have therapeutic potential in  the treatment of allergic airway disease.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of some lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic-nutritional status in growing goat kids. twenty growing maltese goat kids (10 control and 10 bios) were studied. the animals of the bios group received a concentrate including 1 g x kg(-1) of seb bovino (spray-dried), akron s.r.l., italy, with non bacterial components: gum arabic, soybean meal, silicate alum of magnesium, and with bacterial components: 10(11) cfu kg(-1) each of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri. monthly, bio-metric and weight evaluations were carried out on each animal and individual blood samples were taken. the bios group showed the highest body weight (control 19 vs. bios 23 kg p < 0.001), anamorphosis (control 71 vs. bios 78 p < 0.05) and body proportion (control 35 vs. bios 41 p < 0.001) indices; the lowest levels of non esterified fatty acids (control 0.778 vs. bios 0.403 mmol l(-1) p < 0.001), triglycerides (control 0.21 vs. bios 0.18 mmol l(-1) p < 0.05), urea (control 8.83 vs. bios 7.65 mmol l(-1) p < 0.05) and the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase (control 270 vs. bios 851 u l(-1) p <  0.01) and creatine kinase (control 173 vs. bios 285 u l(-1) p < 0.01). the results testify to the better metabolic activity of the bios group which achieved, at the end of the trial (7 months old), about 99% of the morphological  development of the adult, therefore an adequate structure for mating and going into production within the first year of life.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == impact of two probiotic lactobacillus strains feeding on fecal lactobacilli and weight gains in chicken.
AB  == two probiotic strains, lactobacillus agilis jcm 1048 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius jcm 1230 isolated from chicken intestine, exhibited probiotic characteristics that can be applied for chicken production. after 7 days of probiotic feeding (fd7), the count of intestinal lactobacilli in the probiotic group (group p, n=10) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in the control  group (group c, n=9). after 40 days of probiotic feeding (fd40), the lactobacilli and enterococci counts were stable but the enterobacteriaceae number was significantly reduced (p<0.05). a total of 163 isolated lactobacilli were identified as the l. acidophilus/gallinarum group (49.7%), l. agilis (30.7%), l.  salivarius (9.2%), l. reuteri (9.2%), and lactobacillus spp. (1.2%). the probiotic lactobacilli positively affected the lactobacillus biota in chickens at fd7, with a significant increase in the number (p<0.05) of l. agilis and group p. the viable counts of each lactobacillus species at fd40, however, showed no differences between two groups. an increasing incidence of l. agilis was also noted with probiotic feeding. the probiotic effect of two strains resulted in significantly increased weight gains (10.7%) of group p in comparison with group  c at fd40 (p<0.01).

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16s rdna clone libraries.
AB  == the chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. a strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16s rdna clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. a comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. the 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rdna sequences, 58% of which were classified as low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as proteobacteria. based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. approximately 94% of cloned sequences were  classified into low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to bacteroides  spp., and 2% were classified into proteobacteria. clostridium subcluster xiva (38%), clostridium cluster iv (13%), lactobacillus spp. (24%), and bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in  which the clostridium subcluster xiva was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. the 16s rdna sequences of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. reuteri were the most frequently found in the lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826; l. fermentum kld; l. reuteri 100-23; l. salivarius ucc43321; l. paracasei lbtgs1.4; l. casei atcc393), based on pcr amplification of 16s rna coding sequences. first, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16s rna coding sequences of six lactobacillus strains. the reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. the expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. the specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal dna. for five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. for the strain l. casei atcc393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.

TI  == colonization of the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach by lactobacilli.
AB  == selective adhesion to only certain epithelia is particularly common among the bacterial members of the indigenous microflora of mammals. we have found that the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach is colonized by gram-positive rods. the microscopic features of a dense layer of these bacteria on the epithelium were found to be similar to those reported in mice, rats, and swine. adhering microorganisms were isolated and identified as lactobacillus salivarius, l. crispatus, l. reuteri, and l. agilis by dna-dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing techniques. these lactobacilli associated with the horse, except for l. reuteri, were found to adhere to horse epithelial cells in vitro but not to those of rats. a symbiotic relationship of these lactobacilli with the horse is suggested.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == in vitro studies of porcine lactobacilli for possible probiotic use.
AB  == fourteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from the gut of suckling pigs were identified and studied to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial feed additives, acid tolerance, adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine and antimicrobial activity. four strains were identified as lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, two strains as lactobacillus rhamnosus as well  as lactobacillus reuteri and three strains as lactobacillus salivarius. the remaining strains could not be identified. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed susceptibility of the lactobacilli to many of the antimicrobial feed additives commonly used in pigs. strains resistant to cyadox and nourseothricin occurred in high numbers. the tested lactobacilli were acid-resistant at ph 3. thirteen strains of lactobacilli exhibited strong adherence to epithelial cells from the porcine intestine while one strain was classed as weakly-adherent. all lactobacilli showed inhibitory activity against indicator bacteria in the presence of glucose. lactate and acetate were the principal final products of glucose fermentation in all strains. only three strains produced h2o2 in detectable amounts.

TI  == [a microflora study of the gastrointestinal tract of mink housed within and outside of the area of the chernobyl atomic electric power station].
AB  == quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the chernobyl npp (experimental animals) and at the cherkassy fur farm (control animals). obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevailed  in the stomach of experimental minks. species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--l. bavaricus, l. coryniformis, l. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--l. salivarius and l. jensenii. in limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of l. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--l. confusus and l. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the chernobyl and cherkassy minks. among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (l. acidophilus, l. sharpeae) and,  heterofermentative (l. confusus, l. fermentum) in the control were found.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. it has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. on the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. as starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus and l. sanfrancisco. in addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily  l. acidophilus, l. reuteri and l. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).
