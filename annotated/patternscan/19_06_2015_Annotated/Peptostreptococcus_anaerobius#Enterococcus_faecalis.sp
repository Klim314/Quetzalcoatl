TI  == a comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. the present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. materials and methods: to analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions  were employed: a. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 5% b. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 3% c. chlorhexidine 2% d. chlorhexidine (chx) 0.12% e. doxycycline 0.01% f. doxycycline 0.005% g. mtad. an agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. enterococcus faecalis (mtcc-439) 2. candida albicans (mtcc-183) 3. fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586) 4. peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc-27337) the inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. the inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. by this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against  different pathogens could be compared. results: mtad showed maximum antibacterial activity. in case of c. albicans mtad was less effective than 5% naocl, 3% naocl  and 2% chx, 0.12% chx. however, it was more effective against e. faecalis, f. nuleatum and p. anaerobicus. in any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only  prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. e. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against c. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. conclusion: it was found that mtad was more antimicrobial than 5% naocl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of mtad to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% naocl. in addition, 5 and 3% naocl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. the best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% naocl.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
