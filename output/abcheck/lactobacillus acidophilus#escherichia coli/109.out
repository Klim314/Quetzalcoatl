oligosaccharide-mediated inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human gut epithelial cells in vitro.
the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (pos) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic e. coli, and one nonclinical strain of desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures.
lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison.
attachment was determined in the human ht29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria.
pos in buffer at ph 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic e. coil and verotoxigenic e. coli strains to less than 30% of control values.
concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). l. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of l. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value.
pos reduced the adhesion of d. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value.
pos also had a protective effect against e. coli verocytotoxins vt1 and vt2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.
