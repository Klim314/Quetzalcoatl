TI  - Autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  - Autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. The luxS gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (AI-2). The gene was identified in a shotgun library of Erwinia amylovora and primers designed for PCR amplification from bacterial DNA. Supernatants of several Erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for AI-2 activity with a Vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. Many other plant-associated bacteria also showed AI-2 activity such as Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia tasmaniensis. The luxS genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha and a Salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxS, for synthesis of AI-2. Assays to detect AI-2 activity in culture supernatants of several Pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of AI-2 or synthesis of another type. Several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL, AI-1) by Erwinia amylovora, but confirmed AHL-synthesis for Erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and Pantoea stewartii.
TI  - Molecular differentiation of Erwinia amylovora strains from North America and of  two Asian pear pathogens by analyses of PFGE patterns and hrpN genes.
AB  - In order to determine a possible genomic divergence of Erwinia amylovora'fruit tree' and raspberry strains from North America, several isolates were differentiated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, the size of short DNA sequence repeats (SSRs) and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of their hrpN genes. By PFGE analysis European strains are highly related, whereas strains from North America were diverse and were further distinguished by the SSR numbers from plasmid pEA29. The E. amylovora strains from Europe showed identical HrpN sequences in contrast to the American isolates from fruit trees and raspberry. Those were related to each other, but distinguishable by their HrpN patterns. The Asian pear pathogens differed in HrpN among each other and from E. amylovora. Erwinia pyrifoliae isolates and the Erwinia strains from Japan were ordered via their HrpN sequences in agreement with the PFGE patterns. For all three pathogens, dendrograms from PFGE and sequence data indicate an evolutionary diversity within the species in spite of a genetic conservation for parts of the hrpN genes suggesting a long persistence of the Asian pear pathogens in Korea and Japan as well as of fire blight in North America. Some of the divergent American E. amylovora isolates share PFGE patterns with the relatively uniform European strains.
TI  - Molecular characterization of natural Erwinia pyrifoliae strains deficient in hypersensitive response.
AB  - From necrotic tissue of a Nashi pear tree, 24 Erwinia pyrifoliae strains, found to be identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, were isolated. Thirteen strains were not virulent on immature pears and did not induce a hypersensitive response in tobacco leaves. The defective gene hrpL was complemented with intact genes from E. pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora.
