TI  - KpsC and KpsS are retaining 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Several clinically important Gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for CPS biosynthesis and export; examples include Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Pasteurella multocida. Each CPS contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini. In E. coli and N. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the CPS via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo), referred to as a poly-Kdo linker. The Kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. To date, the only characterized Kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. Here, we identify two conserved proteins from CPS assembly systems, KpsC and KpsS, as the beta-Kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-Kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. KpsS adds the first Kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by KpsC. Cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the E. coli and N. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.
TI  - One-pot multi-enzyme (OPME) chemoenzymatic synthesis of sialyl-Tn-MUC1 and sialyl-T-MUC1 glycopeptides containing natural or non-natural sialic acid.
AB  - A series of STn-MUC1 and ST-MUC1 glycopeptides containing naturally occurring and non-natural sialic acids have been chemoenzymatically synthesized from Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide using one-pot multienzyme (OPME) approaches. In situ generation of the sialyltransferase donor cytidine 5'-monophosphate-sialic acid (CMP-Sia) using a CMP-sialic acid synthetase in the presence of an extra amount of cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) and removal of CMP from the reaction mixture by flash C18 cartridge purification allow the complete consumption of Tn-MUC1 glycopeptide for quantitative synthesis of STn-MUC1. A Campylobacter jejuni beta1-3GalT (CjCgtBDelta30-His6) mutant has been found to catalyze the transfer of one or more galactose residues to Tn-MUC1 for the synthesis of T-MUC1 and galactosylated T-MUC1. Sialylation of T-MUC1 using Pasteurella multocida alpha2-3-sialyltransferase 3 (PmST3) with Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase (NmCSS) and Escherichia coli sialic acid aldolase in one pot produced ST-MUC1 efficiently. These glycopeptides are potential cancer vaccine candidates.
TI  - Complete chemoenzymatic synthesis of the Forssman antigen using novel glycosyltransferases identified in Campylobacter jejuni and Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - We have identified an alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase (CgtD) and a beta1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CgtE) in the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) locus of Campylobacter jejuni LIO87. Strains that carry these genes may have the capability of synthesizing mimics of the P blood group antigens of the globoseries glycolipids. We have also identified an alpha1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Pm1138) from Pasteurella multocida Pm70, which is involved in the synthesis of an LOS-bound Forssman antigen mimic and represents the only known bacterial glycosyltransferase with this specificity. The genes encoding the three enzymes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble recombinant proteins that can be used to chemoenzymatically synthesize the Forssman antigen, and its biosynthetic precursors, in high yields.
TI  - Prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in Ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  - Visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across Ontario. Between May and July 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. One specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. All dogs were judged to be in good health. Zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. The primary pathogen was Clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. Seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase E. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the genus Salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. Giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Campylobacter spp., Microsporum canis, group A streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. Further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.
TI  - Survey of parasites and bacterial pathogens from free-living waterfowl in zoological settings.
AB  - To determine if free-living waterfowl residing in a zoological setting pose health risks for its animal collections, visitors, and employees, 450 fecal samples were collected and cultured for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella multocida. A survey of endoparasites infecting the waterfowl was also conducted. Sixty-seven percent, 42%, and 1.7% of the samples tested positive for E. coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella spp., respectively. No P. multocida was isolated from the sampled population. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the bacterial isolates demonstrated that a majority of the isolates were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. A survey for parasites revealed 16% of the samples had coccidia oocytes; 8% of the sample had spirurid ova; and 17% of the sample had strongylate-type nematode ova. Ascaris spp. ova, Capillaria spp. ova, oxyurid ova, and mites were also noted in some fecal samples.
TI  - Bacterial flora of free-living double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) chicks on Prince Edward Island, Canada, with reference to enteric bacteria and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Cloacal and pharyngeal swabs from 100 tree-nesting Double-crested cormorant (DCC) chicks were examined by culture for commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. No Salmonella or Erysipelothrix were isolated from the cloacal swabs. Twenty-two cloacal swabs were positive for Campylobacter, of which 14 were C. jejuni, C. coli, and 1 C. lari. None belonged to common serotypes isolated from humans or animals in recent years in Canada. Tests for antimicrobial drug resistance among 187 commensal Escherichia coli isolates from the cloacal swabs indicated that < or =5% were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. This contrasts with the frequently high resistance rates among E. coli isolates from poultry. Pharyngeal swabs from DCC were negative for Pasteurella multocida. Culture of cloacal swabs from 100 ground-nesting DCC chicks resulted in the recovery of 19 Salmonella isolates, all of which were S. enterica serotype Typhimurium. None of these isolates were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. Altogether, these findings suggest that DCC from this region are not being colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria from agricultural or human sources and that enteric bacteria isolated from these birds are unlikely to contribute to a gene pool of antimicrobial drug resistance.
TI  - [The current antimicrobial resistance situation in Swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight Swiss laboratories from May 1999 to February 2000. Using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococci, and enterococci. Differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in E. coli and salmonella. Some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. A significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. This includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli. A similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid. Staphylococci from dogs (S. intermedius and S. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. Finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in Switzerland is relatively favorable.
TI  - Fecal shedding and antimicrobial susceptibility of selected bacterial pathogens and a survey of intestinal parasites in free-living waterfowl.
AB  - Free-living waterfowl residing in metropolitan parks in central Ohio were surveyed for the fecal shedding and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella multocida. In addition, a survey for intestinal parasites was also conducted in these same waterfowl to determine parasite burdens in free-living waterfowl. Prevalences of 67%, 50%, and 0.2% of E. coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella spp., respectively, were observed for all waterfowl species. Pasteurella multocida was not isolated from the sampled population. Salmonella java was isolated from one mallard duck. Statistically, there was a significantly higher E. coli isolation rate for mallard ducks than for Canada geese, but no difference was observed for C. jejuni isolation rates between waterfowl species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted via the disk diffusion method and multidrug resistance was exhibited for penicillin G, lincomycin, vancomycin, erythromycin, and bacitracin. In addition, the prevalence of endoparasites in these sampled waterfowl ranged from 5% to 66%. Protozoan oocysts were most prevalent followed by nematode ova. No trematode or cestode ovum was recovered from this sampled population.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of chicken and turkey heterophil peptides CHP1, CHP2, THP1, and THP3.
AB  - Four avian heterophil antimicrobial cationic peptides (Chicken Heterophil Peptides 1 and 2, and Turkey Heterophil Peptides 1 and 3) were evaluated for in vitro microbicidal activity against selected avian pathogens and human pathogens which are harbored by birds. At concentrations of 16-2 micrograms/ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of Candida albicans, Salmonella enteriditis, and Campylobacter jejuni. None of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of Pasteurella multocida by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration (16 micrograms/ml) tested. At 16 micrograms/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - [The "diseased" or "dead" guillemots (Uria aalge), three-toed gulls (Rissa tridactyla), silver gulls (Larus argentatus) and laughing gulls (Larus ridibundus) found in the area of the German Bay, 1982-1985].
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 Guillemots (Uria aalge), 41 Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 26 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 34 Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. The probable cause of death was established. Parasitosis were particularly prevalent in Herring Gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in Black-headed Gulls--was with Cestoides. In Kittiwakes and Guillemots mainly Spiruroideae were recorded. The commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was Escherichia coli, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. The species of Salmonella most frequently isolated was Salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. Also recorded were Yersinia intermedia Serovar 0:17 (1x), Pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the Haemophilus-Pasteurella-Actinobacillus group (1x), Pasteurella multocida (2x), Moraxella septicaemiae (1x), Campylobacter spec. (1x), Mycoplasma spec. (6x), DNase positive Staphylococcus spec. (4x) and Streptococcus spec. (6x). Less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with Aspergillus spec. (4x) and Blastomyces spec. (4x). As for viruses one Guillemot was found to have an Adenovirus and another one to have a Paramyxovirus. From one of the Herring Gulls there also was isolated a Paramyxovirus, from a second one to a Reovirus. Three other species isolated have get to be identified. The chief cause of sickness and death in the Guillemots was oil-contamination. The majority of the examined Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. Many of the Black-headed Gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. In order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. Without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. Azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 microgram/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It inhibited Campylobacter spp. and Pasteurella multocida, and had an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.
