TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - [Preliminary investigation of intestinal microflora in patients with hepatic cirrhosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the differential levels of fecal Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile between patients with hepatic cirrhosis and healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected from 29 patients with hepatic cirrhosis treated in the Department of Digestive Diseases at Zunyi Hospital between March and December of 2010. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 13 healthy college students for use as controls. All samples were assessed by pH measurement, bacterial culture for turbidity, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The t-test and rank correlation test were used to determine statistical significance of intergroup differences in each tested parameter. RESULTS: The feces of patients with hepatic cirrhosis had higher pH than that of healthy controls (6.79+/-0.64 vs. 6.18+/-0.74, P less than 0.05). The bacterial turbidity was not significantly different between the feces of hepatic cirrhosis patients and healthy controls (1.15+/-0.59 vs. 1.39+/-1.01, P more than 0.05). The numbers of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile in feces of patients with hepatic cirrhosis were significantly lower than those of the controls (all P less than 0.01). No significant correlation was found between the number or ratio of bacteria species and the severity of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh scores; P more than 0.05). CONCLUSION: The total quantity of intestinal bacteria in patients with hepatic cirrhosis is not significantly different from that in healthy patients. However, the profile of intestinal bacteria is different, which may explain the increased pH of fecal samples from patients with hepatic cirrhosis, but the differential profile is not correlated to cirrhosis pathogenesis.
TI  - Smokers with active Crohn's disease have a clinically relevant dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have an intestinal dysbiosis with  components of the microbiota exerting differential immune effects. Smoking is associated with an increased incidence of CD, more frequent relapse, and greater burden of surgery. This study aimed to investigate the association between smoking and the intestinal microbiota in patients with active CD. METHODS: Patients with active CD (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 66) were recruited and demographic and clinical data recorded including current smoking behavior. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization using probes targeting 16S rRNA of bacteria previously shown to be altered in active CD (bifidobacteria, bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Escherichia coli, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). RESULTS: In total, 29/101 (29%) patients with CD and 8/58 (14%) controls were current smokers (P = 0.032). Following multivariate analysis, smoking was found to have a significant and independent effect on the microbiota of patients with CD, with higher Bacteroides-Prevotella in smokers (38.4%) compared with nonsmokers (28.1%) (F((1,93)) = 12.6, P = 0.001). Healthy controls who smoked also had higher Bacteroides-Prevotella (34.8%) than nonsmokers (24.1%) (F((1,55)) = 4.5, P = 0.038). In the pooled multivariate analysis, patients with CD had higher bifidobacteria (F((1,156)) = 30.5, P < 0.001), higher Bacteroides-Prevotella (F((1,156)) = 6.5, P = 0.012), and lower F. prausnitzii (F((1,156)) = 3.8, P = 0.052) compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have luminal microbiota that consist of significantly higher bacteroides. Investigation of whether this is one mechanism through which the negative effects of smoking on CD are mediated is warranted.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of Crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 CD patients (age- and sex-matched). The DNA extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. Specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. The same DNA extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled cRNA amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. RESULTS: Even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and CD patients were detected. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal CD patients, respectively. Additionally, probes specific for Ruminococcus bromii, Oscillibacter valericigenes, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the DNA samples from healthy subjects. Conversely, species overrepresented in CD patients were E. coli, Enterococcus faecium, and species from the Proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human GI tract. Furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that are not closely related to any known species (Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. CONCLUSIONS: These two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal CD patients. Specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for CD, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.
TI  - The role of pH in determining the species composition of the human colonic microbiota.
AB  - The pH of the colonic lumen varies with anatomical site and microbial fermentation of dietary residue. We have investigated the impact of mildly acidic pH, which occurs in the proximal colon, on the growth of different species of human colonic bacteria in pure culture and in the complete microbial community. Growth was determined for 33 representative human colonic bacteria at three initial pH values (approximately 5.5, 6.2 and 6.7) in anaerobic YCFA medium, which includes a mixture of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with 0.2% glucose as energy source. Representatives of all eight Bacteroides species tested grew poorly at pH 5.5, as did Escherichia coli, whereas 19 of the 23 gram-positive anaerobes tested gave growth rates at pH 5.5 that were at least 50% of those at pH 6.7. Growth inhibition of B. thetaiotaomicron at pH 5.5 was increased by the presence of the SCFA mix (33 mM acetate, 9 mM propionate and 1 mM each of iso-valerate, valerate and iso-butyrate). Analysis of amplified 16S rRNA sequences demonstrated a major pH-driven shift within a human faecal bacterial community in a continuous flow fermentor. Bacteroides spp. accounted for 27% of 16S rRNA sequences detected at pH 5.5, but 86% of sequences at pH 6.7. Conversely, butyrate-producing gram-positive bacteria related to Eubacterium rectale represented 50% of all 16S rRNA sequences at pH 5.5, but were not detected at pH 6.7. Inhibition of the growth of a major group of gram-negative bacteria at mildly acidic pH apparently creates niches that can be exploited by more low pH-tolerant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro effects of selected synbiotics on the human faecal microbiota composition.
AB  - Synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. However, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition has not been determined. Eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four probiotics, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or Bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h pH-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. The prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. Effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using FISH. Rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. Synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group. Lower levels of Escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10 h of fermentation. Probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. Multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of Lactobacillus-Enterococcus were observed when the probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. Here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
TI  - Characterization of the gastrointestinal mucosa-associated microbiota of pigs and chickens using culture-based and molecular methodologies.
AB  - The microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) can play an important role in  the healthy status of farm animals and in the safety of the whole food chain. In this study, the mucosa-associated microbiota of the GIT of pigs and chickens was analyzed by culture methods and fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry (FCM-FISH). In all pig GIT sections, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Atopobium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium histolyticum were the predominant bacterial groups. Atopobium, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus were detected at higher levels (P < 0.05) in the intestine than in the stomach. In all broilers' GIT sections, lactic acid bacteria, Atopobium, Bacteroides, and Escherichia coli were the predominant bacterial groups. Atopobium, Bifidobacterium, E. coli, and Eubacterium rectale--Clostridium coccoides counts were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the crop, while those of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus were higher (P < 0.05) in the large intestine. Lactic acid bacteria were one of the predominant GIT mucosa-associated bacteria of pigs and broilers, which could be an index of their healthy status. FCM-FISH analysis also allowed the detection of bacterial groups hard to cultivate yet quantitatively important. The distribution of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides followed the same trend in both animal species, whereas that of Atopobium and Bifidobacterium was the opposite. These results contribute to the knowledge on the diversity and distribution of the animal GIT mucosa-associated microbiota.
TI  - Imbalance in the composition of the duodenal microbiota of children with coeliac  disease.
AB  - Coeliac disease (CD) is the most common immune-mediated enteropathy characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa. The ingestion of gluten is responsible for the symptoms of CD, but other environmental factors are also thought to play a role in this disorder. In this study, the composition of the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children with active disease, symptom-free CD patients on a gluten-free diet and control children was determined. Bacteriological analyses of duodenal biopsy specimens were carried out by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry. The proportions of total bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were significantly higher in CD patients with active disease than in symptom-free CD patients and controls. Bacteroides and Escherichia coli groups were significantly more abundant in CD patients with active disease than in controls, whilst these bacterial deviations were normalized in symptom-free CD patients. The ratio of Lactobacillus--Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides--E. coli was significantly reduced in coeliac patients with either active or inactive disease compared with controls. The differences in Atopobium, Eubacterium rectale--Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium lituseburense, sulphate-reducing bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii populations among the three groups of children were less relevant. Overall, the higher incidence of Gram-negative and potentially pro-inflammatory bacteria in the duodenal microbiota of coeliac children was linked to the symptomatic presentation of the disease and could favour the pathological process of the disorder.
TI  - Flavanol monomer-induced changes to the human faecal microflora.
AB  - We have investigated the bacterial-dependent metabolism of ( - )-epicatechin and  (+)-catechin using a pH-controlled, stirred, batch-culture fermentation system reflective of the distal region of the human large intestine. Incubation of ( - )-epicatechin or (+)-catechin (150 mg/l or 1000 mg/l) with faecal bacteria, led to the generation of 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 5-phenyl-gamma-valerolactone and phenylpropionic acid. However, the formation of these metabolites from (+)-catechin required its initial conversion to (+)-epicatechin. The metabolism of both flavanols occurred in the presence of favourable carbon sources, notably sucrose and the prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharides, indicating that bacterial utilisation of flavanols also occurs when preferential energy sources are available. (+)-Catechin incubation affected the growth of select microflora, resulting in a statistically significant increase in the growth of the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, Bifidobacterium spp. and Escherichia coli, as well as a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of the C. histolyticum group. In contrast, the effect of ( - )-epicatechin was less profound, only significantly increasing the growth of the C. coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group. These potential prebiotic effects for both (+)-catechin and ( - )-epicatechin were most notable at the lower concentration of 150 mg/l. As both ( - )-epicatechin and (+)-catechin were converted to the same metabolites, the more dramatic change in the growth of distinct microfloral populations produced by (+)-catechin incubation may be linked to the bacterial conversion of (+)-catechin to (+)-epicatechin. Together these data suggest that the consumption of flavanol-rich foods may support gut health through their ability to exert prebiotic actions.
TI  - Cloning, expression and purification of arylsulfate sulfotransferase from Eubacterium A-44.
AB  - A gene (astA) encoding arylsulfate sulfotransferase (ASST), which transfers a sulfate group from phenolic sulfate esters to phenolic acceptors, was cloned from a Eubacterium A-44 genomic library. The probe (1.5 kb fragment) for the astA gene was prepared from the PCR product of the primers produced using two internal amino acid sequences of ASST, which had been purified from Eubacterium A-44. The astA gene was cloned into the pKF3 vector. Its sequence revealed a 1863 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein containing 620 amino acids with a secretary signal peptide, and showed 91% homology (identity) to Eubacterium rectale IIIH previously reported. The cloned astA gene was expressed under the T7 promoter of the expression vectors, pET-39b(+) and pET-26b(+), in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the expressed ASSTs were purified using His Bind column chromatography. The specific activities of the purified ASSTs were 25.6 micromol/min/mg and 37.1 micromol/min/mg, respectively.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
AB  - Liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium paraputrificum. This study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Eubacterium rectale.
