TI  - New iron acquisition system in Bacteroidetes.
AB  - Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a dog mouth commensal and a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum, causes rare but often fatal septicemia in humans that have been in contact with a dog. Here, we show that C. canimorsus strains isolated from human infections grow readily in heat-inactivated human serum and that this property depends on a typical polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL), namely, PUL3 in strain Cc5. PUL are a hallmark of Bacteroidetes, and they encode various products, including surface protein complexes that capture and process polysaccharides or glycoproteins. The archetype system is the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Sus system, devoted to starch utilization. Unexpectedly, PUL3 conferred the capacity to acquire iron from serotransferrin (STF), and this capacity required each of the seven encoded proteins, indicating that a whole Sus-like machinery is acting as an iron capture system (ICS), a new and unexpected function for Sus-like machinery. No siderophore could be detected in the culture supernatant of C. canimorsus, suggesting that the Sus-like machinery captures iron directly from transferrin, but this could not be formally demonstrated. The seven genes of the ICS were found in the genomes of several opportunistic pathogens from the Capnocytophaga and Prevotella genera, in different isolates of the severe poultry pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer, and in strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Odoribacter splanchnicus isolated from human infections. Thus, this study describes a new type of ICS that evolved in Bacteroidetes from a polysaccharide utilization system and most likely represents an important virulence factor in this group.
TI  - Metagenomic analysis of the gastric microbiota cultivable from a patient with gastritis concomitant with Barrett's esophagus.
AB  - Barrett's esophagus is a distal metaplasia characterized by the transformation of squamous mucosa into columnar mucosa. This esophageal phenotype is a product not only of the chronic reflux of gastric acids, but also by microorganisms that colonize the oral cavity and stomach. Two classes of microbiota can be identified in Barrett's esophagus; microbiota type I is associated with the normal esophagus and type II with an inflamed esophagus. The present study describes the gastric microbiota of a patient with antral gastritis concomitant with Barrett's esophagus absent infection with Helicobacter pylori. Gastric biopsies were obtained following the protocol of Sydney and following ethical practices. The isolates were cultivated under microaerophilic conditions on Columbia Agar supplemented with IsoVitaleX and 7% sterile blood. Extracted DNA was sequenced using 454-GS and the results analyzed on the MG-RAST server. Gram negative isolates were found and bacteria resistant to levofloxacin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. The phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, the genus Bacteroides and the species group Bacteroides fragilis were most abundant. Functionally, the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and to a lesser extent, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were most dominant, and of which the enzymes beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) were most dominant. The findings of this study, because they are of only one case may probably suggest a possible pathogenic role, previously undescribed for Bacteroides fragilis, associated with human gastritis when concomitant esophageal pathology exists.
TI  - A commensal bacterial product elicits and modulates migratory capacity of CD39(+) CD4 T regulatory subsets in the suppression of neuroinflammation.
AB  - Tolerance established by host-commensal interactions regulates host immunity at both local mucosal and systemic levels. The intestinal commensal strain Bacteroides fragilis elicits immune tolerance, at least in part, via the expression capsular polysaccharide A (PSA). How such niche-specific commensal microbial elements regulate extra-intestinal immune responses, as in the brain, remains largely unknown. We have recently shown that oral treatment with PSA suppresses neuro-inflammation elicited during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. This protection is dependent upon the expansion of immune-regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) expressing CD39, an ectonucleotidase. Here, we further show that CD39 modulation of purinergic signals enhances migratory phenotypes of both total CD4 T cells and Foxp3(+) CD4 Tregs at central nervous system (CNS) lymphoid-draining sites in EAE in vivo and promotes their migration in vitro. These changes are noted during PSA treatment, which leads to heightened accumulation of CD39(+) CD4 Tregs in the CNS. Deficiency of CD39 abrogates accumulation of Treg during EAE, and is accompanied by elevated Th1/Th17 signals in the CNS and in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Our results demonstrate that immune-modulatory commensal bacterial products impact the migratory patterns of CD4 Treg during CNS autoimmunity via the regulation of CD39. These observations provide clues as to how intestinal commensal microbiome is able to modulate Treg functions and impact host immunity in the distal site.
TI  - A pilot study on the effect of Lactobacillus casei Zhang on intestinal microbiota parameters in Chinese subjects of different age.
AB  - Ageing of the population is an imminent global problem. Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LcZ) was isolated from Inner Mongolian fermented milk, koumiss. LcZ possesses numerous probiotic properties in in vitro tests and in animal models. However, it has never been tested in any human trial. In the current study, the impact of oral consumption of LcZ on different age groups was tested. Chinese subjects, including 10 young, 7 middle-aged and 7 elderly volunteers (with mean age of 24.3, 47.6 and 64.7, respectively), were recruited. Each subject took 10.6 log10 cfu LcZ daily for a continuous period of 28 days. Several parameters, including the amounts of LcZ and four selected groups of bacteria, change of bacterial diversity, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and total bile acids (TBA), were monitored in faecal samples collected from the subjects before starting, during and after stopping oral LcZ consumption. The consumption of LcZ exhibited beneficial effects to the subjects by modulating faecal microbiota in a temporal manner with a prolonged elevation of SCFA and reduction of TBA. The potentially harmful Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter genera were suppressed by the probiotic administration. Furthermore, a moderately divergent response was observed in the indigenous gut populations of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis group in different age subjects. Taken together, the current study has provided proof on the positive effect of probiotic consumption and crucial insights into the design and application of probiotic-based products to users of different age segments.
TI  - In vitro effect of antibiotics on biofilm formation by Bacteroides fragilis group strains isolated from intestinal microbiota of dogs and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - The Bacteroides fragilis group strains colonize the intestinal tract of dogs as commensal bacteria. Nevertheless, they can be opportunistic pathogens responsible for significant morbidity and mortality rates in dogs, like in oral infections, abscesses and wound infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility in B. fragilis strains isolated from dogs intestinal microbiota and to evaluate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of some antimicrobials on biofilm formation. A total of 30 B. fragilis group strains were tested for susceptibility to ten antimicrobial agents by broth microdilution method. Thirteen B. fragilis strains were tested for biofilm formation and the biofilm producer strains were chosen to evaluate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobials on biofilm formation. The isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, metronidazole, imipenem and chloramphenicol. Tetracycline and clindamycin were active against 50% and 33% of the strains, respectively. When biofilm-forming strains were grown in the presence of sub-MICs of imipenem and metronidazole, the inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. In contrast, enrofloxacin at (1/2) MIC caused a significant increase in biofilm formation in two of four strains examined. In conclusion, the B. fragilis group strains isolated were susceptible to most of the antimicrobials tested and the sub-MIC concentrations of imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were able to inhibit the biofilm formation.
TI  - Design and in vitro evaluation of a novel poly(methacrylic acid)/metronidazole antibacterial nanogel as an oral dosage form.
AB  - To overcome the undesirable side-effects of metronidazole (MTZ), ethylene glycol  dimethacrylate is used as the cross-linker, and a series of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) nanogels were prepared to load the MTZ. We investigated the morphology, size, in vitro release property in the simulated gastrointestinal medium, long-term antibacterial performance against Bacteroides fragilis, cytotoxicity, stability and activity of this novel MTZ/PMAA nanogel. The results indicate that the MTZ/PMAA nanogel sustained the release of MTZ in long-term antibacterial activity in the simulated gastrointestinal medium. This MTZ/PMAA nanogel exhibits less cytotoxicity than MTZ alone, suggesting that MTZ/PMAA nanogel is a more useful dosage form than MTZ for mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile infections. The novel aspects of this study include the synthesis of a nanogel and the three-phase study of the release profile, which might be useful for other researchers in this field.
TI  - Structural and functional characterization of NanU, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes species.
AB  - Many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. We identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in Tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (NanOU), where NanO (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative TonB-dependent receptor and NanU (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted SusD family protein. Using heterologous complementation of nanOU genes into an Escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanOU system from the gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on TonB for function. We also show that nanU is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. We also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. Ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to NanU (Kd ~400 nM) from two Bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. Determination of the crystal structure of NanU revealed a monomeric SusD-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. The results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific PUL (polysaccharide utilization locus).
TI  - Microbiota modulate behavioral and physiological abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are defined by core behavioral impairments; however, subsets of individuals display a spectrum of gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities. We demonstrate GI barrier defects and microbiota alterations in the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model that is known to display features of ASD. Oral treatment of MIA offspring with the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis corrects gut permeability, alters microbial composition, and ameliorates defects in communicative, stereotypic, anxiety-like and sensorimotor behaviors. MIA offspring display an altered serum metabolomic profile, and B. fragilis modulates levels of several metabolites. Treating naive mice with a metabolite that is increased by MIA and restored by B. fragilis causes certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that gut bacterial effects on the host metabolome impact behavior. Taken together, these findings support a gut-microbiome-brain connection in a mouse model of ASD and identify a potential probiotic therapy for GI and particular behavioral symptoms in human neurodevelopmental disorders.
TI  - Proteomic changes in Bacteroides fragilis exposed to subinhibitory concentration  of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from clinical specimens and piperacillin/tazobactam is among the drugs that can be used to treat polymicrobial infections in which this bacteria is often involved. During antibiotic therapy, inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics are always followed by subinhibitory concentrations which can generate phenotypic changes in bacteria. So, in this study we aimed to evaluate changes in the proteomic profile of B. fragilis grown in a sub-MIC of PTZ, using 2-D electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time of-flight. Analysis of the 2-DE gels showed 18 spots with significantly different volume percentages between experimental conditions and 12 were successfully identified by MS/MS. Two proteins with decreased abundance in sub-MIC condition were involved in the glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase), others two involved in amino acid metabolism (Oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase II and dihydrodipicolinate reductase), and finally, one protein involved in fatty acid metabolism (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase). Among the proteins with increased abundance, we founded three ATP synthase (alpha, beta, and alpha type V), which could be involved in antibiotic bacterial resistance by efflux pump, one protein involved in glycolysis (enolase), and one involved in protein degradation (aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase). In conclusion, our data show overall changes in the proteome of B. fragilis conducted by sub-MIC of PTZ, whose consequences on bacterial physiology deserve further investigation.
TI  - Discrimination based on Gly and Arg/Ser at position 673 between dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 7 and DPP11, widely distributed DPPs in pathogenic and environmental gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, expresses the novel Asp/Glu-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 11 (Ohara-Nemoto, Y. et al. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 38115-38127), which has been categorized as a member of the S46/DPP7 family that is preferential for hydrophobic residues at the P1 position. From that finding, 129 gene products constituting five clusters from the phylum Bacteroidetes have been newly annotated to either DPP7 or DPP11, whereas the remaining 135 members, mainly from the largest phylum Proteobacteria, have yet to be assigned. In this study, the substrate specificities of the five clusters and an unassigned group were determined with recombinant DPPs from typical species, i.e., P. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Shewanella putrefaciens. Consequently, clusters 1, 3, and 5 were found to be DPP7 with rather broad substrate specificity, and clusters 2 and 4 were DPP11. An unassigned S. putrefaciens DPP carrying Ser(673) exhibited Asp/Glu-specificity more preferable to Glu, in contrast to the Asp preference of DPP11 with Arg(673) from Bacteroidetes species. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that Arg(673)/Ser(673) were indispensable for the Asp/Glu-specificity of DPP11, and that the broad specificity of DPP7 was mediated by Gly(673). Taken together with the distribution of the two genes, all 264 members of the S46 family could be attributed to either DPP7 or DPP11 by an amino acid at position 673. A more compelling phylogenic tree based on the conserved C-terminal region suggested two gene duplication events in the phylum Bacteroidetes, one causing the development of DPP7 and DPP11 with altered substrate specificities, and the other producing an additional DPP7 in the genus Bacteroides.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of Aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. In the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of Aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (Streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (Bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. Twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to Aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. S. mutans was the species most sensitive to Aloe vera gel with a MIC of 12.5 microg/ml, while A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and B. fragilis were less sensitive, with a MIC of 25-50 microg/ml (P < 0.01). Based on our present findings it is concluded that Aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Effect of the oral intake of yogurt containing Bifidobacterium longum BB536 on the cell numbers of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in microbiota.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains have been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are needed for clarification. Here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the cell numbers of fecal ETBF in a healthy population. Among 420 healthy adults, 38 subjects were found to be ETBF carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%. Among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium longum BB536 (BB536Y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group (milk group). The cell numbers of ETBF and the dominant species of the B. fragilis group were measured by a quantitative PCR method. Compared with the baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of ETBF at week 8 in the BB536Y group but not in the milk group. Linear mixed models analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes of ETBF cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. These results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating ETBF in the microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future. This is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on ETBF in the microbiota.
TI  - Comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. Thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. The treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. Mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. The numbers of Escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. No toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains were found. No major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.
TI  - Gatifloxacine-loaded PLGA and beta-tricalcium phosphate composite for treating osteomyelitis.
AB  - Gatifloxacine (GFLX)-containing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was introduced  to the pores and surfaces of porous beta-tricalcium phosphate (betaTCP) granules by melt compounding whereby no toxic solvent was used. The granular composite of GFLX-loaded PLGA and betaTCP released GFLX for 42 days in Hanks' balanced solution and exhibited sufficient in vitro bactericidal activity against Streptococcus milleri and Bacteroides fragilis for at least 21 days. For in vivo evaluation, the granular composite was implanted in the dead space created by the debridement of osteomyelitis lesion induced by S. milleri and B. fragilis in rabbit mandible. After a 4-week implantation, the inflammation area within the debrided area was markedly reduced accompanied with osteoconduction and vascularization in half of the rabbits, and even disappeared in one of the six rabbits without any systemic administration of antibiotics. Outside the debrided area, inflammation and sequestrum were observed but the largest of such affected areas amounted to only 0.125 times of the originally infected and debrided area. These findings showed that the granular composite was effective for the local treatment of osteomyelitis as well as an osteoconductive scaffold which supported and encouraged vascularization.
TI  - Development of novel oral formulations prepared via hot melt extrusion for targeted delivery of photosensitizer to the colon.
AB  - Colon-residing bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis, can cause a range of serious clinical infections. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) may be a novel treatment option for these multidrug resistant organisms. The aim of this study was to formulate a Eudragit(R)-based drug delivery system, via hot melt extrusion (HME), for targeting colonic release of photosensitizer. The susceptibility of E. faecalis and B. fragilis to PACT mediated by methylene blue (MB), meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine tetra-tosylate (TMP), or 5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl-ester (h-ALA) was determined, with tetrachlorodecaoxide (TCDO), an oxygen-releasing compound, added in some studies. Results show that, for MB, an average of 30% of the total drug load was released over a 6-h period. For TMP and h-ALA, these values were 50% and 16% respectively. No drug was released in the acidic media. Levels of E. faecalis and B. fragilis were reduced by up to 4.67 and 7.73 logs, respectively, on PACT exposure under anaerobic conditions, with increased kill associated with TCDO. With these formulations, photosensitizer release could potentially be targeted to the colon, and colon-residing pathogens killed by PACT. TCDO could be used in vivo to generate oxygen, which could significantly impact on the success of PACT in the clinic.
TI  - Trans locus inhibitors limit concomitant polysaccharide synthesis in the human gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Bacteroides is an abundant genus of bacteria of the human intestinal microbiota.  Bacteroides species synthesize a large number of capsular polysaccharides (PS), a biological property not shared with closely related oral species, suggesting importance for intestinal survival. Bacteroides fragilis, for example, synthesizes eight capsular polysaccharides per strain, each of which phase varies via inversion of the promoters located upstream of seven of the eight polysaccharide biosynthesis operons. In a single cell, many of these polysaccharide loci promoters can be simultaneously oriented on for transcription of the downstream biosynthesis operons. Here, we demonstrate that despite the promoter orientations, concomitant transcription of multiple polysaccharide loci within a cell is inhibited. The proteins encoded by the second gene of each of these eight loci, collectively designated the UpxZ proteins, inhibit the synthesis of heterologous polysaccharides. These unique proteins interfere with the ability of UpxY proteins encoded by other polysaccharide loci to function in transcriptional antitermination of their respective operon. The eight UpxZs have different inhibitory spectra, thus establishing a hierarchical regulatory network for polysaccharide synthesis. Limitation of concurrent polysaccharide synthesis strongly suggests that these bacteria evolved this property as an evasion-type mechanism to avoid killing by polysaccharide-targeting factors in the ecosystem.
TI  - A polysaccharide from the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis protects against CNS demyelinating disease.
AB  - The intestinal microbiome may have a critical roll in susceptibility or resistance to immune-mediated diseases. Alterations of the gut microflora after oral antibiotic treatment can regulate encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for human multiple sclerosis (MS). We now show that a zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide A (PSA) of Bacteroides fragilis can protect against central nervous system demyelinating disease. Oral administration with purified PSA protected mice against EAE prophylactic and therapeutically. PSA treatment enhanced CD103 expressing dendritic cells (DCs) that accumulated in the cervical lymph nodes. Exposure of naive DCs to PSA induced the conversion of naive CD4(+) T cells into interleukin (IL)-10-producing FoxP3(+)Treg cells. Protection against EAE was completely abrogated in IL-10-deficient mice. Our results show an important role for a molecule from human commensal bacteria in protecting against EAE and suggest the possibility for protection in MS.
TI  - The structurally similar, penta-acylated lipopolysaccharides of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides elicit strikingly different innate immune responses.
AB  - Lipid A structural modifications can substantially impact the host's inflammatory response to bacterial LPS. Bacteroides fragilis, an opportunistic pathogen associated with life-threatening sepsis and intra-abdominal abscess formation, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a symbiont pivotal for proper host intestinal tissue development, both produce an immunostimulatory LPS comprised of penta-acylated lipid A. Under defined conditions, Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen associated with periodontitis, also produces an LPS bearing a penta-acylated lipid A. However, this LPS preparation is 100-1000 times less potent than Bacteroides LPS in stimulating endothelial cells. We analyzed Bacteroides and P. gingivalis lipid A structures using MALDI-TOF MS and gas chromatography to determine the structural basis for this phenomenon. Even though both Bacteroides and P. gingivalis lipid A molecules are penta-acylated and mono-phosphorylated, subtle differences in mass and fatty acid content could account for the observed difference in LPS potency. This fatty acid heterogeneity is also responsible for the peak "clusters" observed in the mass spectra and obfuscates the correlation between LPS structure and immunostimulatory ability. Further, we show the difference in potency between Bacteroides and P. gingivalis LPS is TLR4-dependent. Altogether, the data suggest subtle changes in lipid A structure may profoundly impact the host's innate immune response.
TI  - Metronidazole-loaded bioabsorbable films as local antibacterial treatment of infected periodontal pockets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is infectious in nature and leads to an inflammatory response. It arises from the accumulation of subgingival bacterial plaque and leads to the loss of attachment, increased probing depth, and bone loss. It is one of the world's most prevalent chronic diseases. In this study we developed and studied metronidazole-loaded 50/50 poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA), 75/25 PDLGA, and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) films. These films are designed to be inserted into the periodontal pocket and treat infections with controlled-release metronidazole for >or=1 month. METHODS: The structured films were prepared using the solution-casting technique. Concentrated solutions and high solvent-evaporation rates were used to get most of the drug located in the bulk, i.e., in whole film's volume. The effects of copolymer composition and drug content on the release profile, cell growth, and bacterial inhibition were investigated. RESULTS: The PDLLA and 75/25 PDLGA films generally exhibited a low- or medium-burst release followed by a moderate release at an approximately constant rate, whereas the 50/50 PDLGA films exhibited a biphasic release profile. The drug released from films loaded with 10% weight/weight metronidazole resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial viability within several days. When exposed to human gingival fibroblasts in cell culture conditions, these films maintained their normal fibroblastic features. CONCLUSIONS: This study enabled the understanding of metronidazole-release kinetics from bioabsorbable polymeric films. The developed systems demonstrated good biocompatibility and the ability to inhibit Bacteroides fragilis growth; therefore, they may be useful in the treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Genetic tools for studying Capnocytophaga canimorsus.
AB  - Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from canine oral flora, has been isolated throughout the world from severe human infections caused by dog bites. Due to the low level of evolutionary relationship to Proteobacteria, genetic methods suitable for the genus Capnocytophaga needed to be established. Here, we show that Tn4351, derived from Bacteroides fragilis, could be introduced by conjugation into C. canimorsus and conferred resistance to erythromycin. By mapping and sequencing a naturally occurring plasmid isolated from a clinical isolate of C. canimorsus, we identified a repA gene that allowed us to construct Escherichia coli-Capnocytophaga shuttle vectors. Most commonly used antibiotic markers were not functional in C. canimorsus, but cefoxitin (cfxA), tetracycline (tetQ), and erythromycin (ermF) resistances could be used as markers for plasmid maintenance in C. canimorsus and even in some other Capnocytophaga spp. Shuttle vectors were introduced into C. canimorsus either by conjugation using the origin of transfer (oriT) of RP4 or by electrotransformation. Taking advantage of the promoter of ermF, an expression vector was constructed. Finally, a method that allows site-directed mutagenesis is described. All these genetic tools pave the way, not only for molecular studies of the pathogenesis of C. canimorsus, but also for studies of other oral Capnocytophaga species.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis with spinal epidural abscess in two patients with Bacteroides fragilis bacteraemia.
AB  - We report 2 cases of vertebral osteomyelitis and contiguous epidural abscess due  to Bacteroides fragilis with no concomitant or past intra-abdominal infection. Decompressive surgery with laminectomy was required for both patients due to the occurrence of neurologic deficits. Clinical recovery was achieved after 8 weeks of antibiotic therapy. It included 3 weeks of intravenous therapy with clindamycin followed by an oral regimen of clindamycin for 1 patient and oral metronidazole for the other. In both cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proved to be essential for diagnostic. The primary source of infection remained unknown despite careful investigations.
TI  - Cranial osteomyelitis: a late complication of a dental infection.
AB  - Dental infections are associated with a range of serious complications. The orofacial region provides potential spaces in the tissue that infections of dental origin can occupy. We describe the subtemporal extension of a dental infection, the late development of cranial osteomyelitis, and its surgical management.
TI  - Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of four medicaments used as intracanal medication.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of iodoform, calcium hydroxide, IKI (iodine potassium iodine) and CFC (ciprofloxacin, Flagyl (metronidazole) and calcium hydroxide) required to kill S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and B. fragilis. In the experiment, medicaments were added to bacterial species into test tubes, in 10 different concentrations. The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug at which bacterial growth could not be observed. In this investigation, CFC was the most effective medicament against all bacteria. All drugs were able to eliminate E. faecalis and B. fragilis, while IKI was not effective against S. aureus. IKI and calcium hydroxide were not able to eliminate P. aeruginosa as well.
TI  - Metronidazole single versus multiple daily dosing in serious intraabdominal/pelvic and diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of once-daily versus multiple dose regimens of metronidazole in inpatients with serious/systemic Bacteroides fragilis infections, i.e., intraabdominal/pelvic and diabetic foot infections. A retrospective chart review was performed on 145 adult inpatients who received combination therapy with metronidazole for B. fragilis abdominal/pelvic infection or diabetic (deep) foot infections/osteomyelitis. Exclusion criteria included metronidazole given for indications other than those mentioned, patients who received only one dose of metronidazole, and patients who received oral metronidazole only. The 145 patients were in two groups: 66 patients in the metronidazole 1 g (i.v.) q24h (Group A) and 79 patients who received metronidazole 500 mg (i.v./p.o.) q6-8h dosing (Group B). Patient demographics included age, gender, indications of metronidazole, concomitant, antibiotics, and co-morbidities. Data collection also included length of stay (LOS), antibiotic days, and clinical outcomes. The 145 patients in our study had a mean age of 66 years, 61% were female and 39% male. Most patients were being treated for definitive intraabdominal/pelvic infections (82%), or probable intraabdominal/pelvic infections (22%). Only 6% had deep diabetic foot infections of osteomyelitis (percentages exceed 100% since a patient can have more than one indication) and were included since B. fragilis is also and important pathogen in diabetic osteomyelitis. Group A patients had more concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05 respectively, chi-square test for trend) than Group B patients. There were no statistically significant differences between groups A and B for LOS and antibiotic days (p = 0.42 and p = 0.92 respectively, by rank-sum test), but after adjusting for concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities Group A patients had clinically shorter LOS and fewer antibiotic days. Unadjusted mortality and failure rates were non-significantly higher in group A (relative ratios of 12.1%/6.3% = 6.3% = 1.91 and 18.2%/ 10.1% = 1.80 respectively), but after adjusting for concomitant antibiotics and co-morbidities with stratification analysis, groups A and B were virtually the same (risk differences of </= 1%). The authors conclude that for B. fragilis infections, as part of combination therapy, metronidazole 1 g (i.v.) q 24h appears to eb as efficacious and not inferior to multiply-dosed metronidazole regimens. Once daily metronidazole, i.e., 1 g (i.v.) q24h for the treatment of serious systemic infections where B. fragilis is an important co-pathogen (intraabdominal/pelvic and deep diabetic foot infections) has pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-economic advantages.
TI  - Lemierre Syndrome associated with dental infections. Report of one case and review of the literature.
AB  - The first publication on Lemierre Syndrome appears in 1936 by Lemierre. It is defined as an "oropharynx bacterial infection characterized by the thrombophlebitis in the internal jugular vein, derived in a systemic septic embolism". In 81% of the cases, the Fusobacterium necrophorum is the most frequent etiologic agent. Fever is the most common symptom, but it can depending on the primary infection, tonsillitis, mastoiditis or odontogenic infection. According to the literature the mortality is very low, but with a significant morbidity, that is why the diagnosis and early treatment is very important. The diagnosis it's clinical, even though the CT scan and other diagnosis methods (echography, MRI) help to determine the extent of the infection. It's necessary to administer the antibiotics endovenous at high dose, (keeping in mind that the most frequent micro organism is anaerobic), and vital support measures if necessary. We present a case report of Lemierre Syndrome associated to an odonthogenic infection caused by the 4.8 molar.
TI  - The RprY response regulator of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe associated with chronic adult periodontitis. Its ecological niche is the gingival crevice, where the organism adapts to the challenges of the infectious process such as host defence and bacterial products. Bacterial responses to environmental changes are partly regulated by two-component signal transduction systems. Several intact systems were annotated in the genome of P. gingivalis, as well as an orphan regulator encoding a homologue of RprY, a response regulator from Bacteroides fragilis. With the goal of defining the environmental cues that activate RprY in P. gingivalis, we used several strategies to identify its regulon. Results from gene expression and DNA-protein binding assays identified target genes that were either involved in transport functions or associated with oxidative stress, and indicated that RprY can act as an activator and a repressor. RprY positively activated the primary sodium pump, NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NQR), and RprY protein also interacted with the promoter regions of nqrA genes from B. fragilis and Vibrio cholerae. Given that gingival bleeding and infiltration of host defence cells are symptoms of periodontal infection, iron products released from blood and reactive oxygen species from polymorphonuclear leucocytes may be potential inducers of the RprY regulon.
TI  - Transcriptional organization, regulation and role of the Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 hmu haemin-uptake locus.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral bacterium associated with periodontal disease,  requires haemin for growth. Although several multigenic clusters encoding haemin-uptake systems are present on the genome of P. gingivalis, little is known regarding their transcriptional organization and expression. This study identified a 23 kDa iron-regulated haemin-binding protein encoded by a larger than previously reported variant of hmuY. It was shown that the hmu locus is larger than previously reported and is composed of six genes, hmuYRSTUV, encoding a novel hybrid haemin-uptake system. The locus has an operonic organization and the transcriptional start site is located 292 bp upstream of hmuY. The data indicate that the regulation of the operon is iron-dependent. Interestingly, differential regulation within the operon was demonstrated, resulting in excess of the hmuYR message encoding the outer-membrane proteins when compared to the full-length transcript. In addition, the hmuY transcript is more prevalent than the hmuR transcript. Secondary structure analysis of the hmuYRSTUV mRNA predicted the formation of several potential stem-loops in the 5' ends of hmuR- and hmuS-specific mRNAs, consistent with the differential regulation observed. Finally, it was demonstrated that haemin binding and uptake are elevated in iron-depleted conditions and are reduced 45 % and 70 %, respectively, in an hmu-deficient strain when compared to the parental strain, indicating that the hmu locus plays a major role in haemin acquisition in P. gingivalis. Since homologues of the hmu locus were also found in Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella intermedia, these findings may have implications for a better understanding of haemin acquisition in those organisms as well.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase-encoding gene of the obligate anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated by the redox-sensing transcription activator OxyR.
AB  - Inspection of the genomic DNA sequence of the oral anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis reveals that the micro-organism possesses the peroxide-sensing transcription activator OxyR, but not the superoxide-sensing transcription factor SoxR. Investigatation of oxidative-stress-responsive proteins in P. gingivalis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that two proteins were predominantly upregulated in oxidative conditions. In a P. gingivalis oxyR mutant these two proteins were not induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. By N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the two proteins were found to be superoxide dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, encoded by sod and ahpC, respectively. Northern blot and lacZ fusion analyses revealed that P. gingivalis sod and ahpC were positively regulated by OxyR. Primer extension analysis located the promoter regions of sod and ahpC, and putative -35 boxes of these promoters were found immediately adjacent to their putative OxyR-binding sequences. Moreover, the promoter regions of sod and ahpC had the ability to bind P. gingivalis OxyR protein. These results demonstrate that P. gingivalis sod is one of the OxyR regulons, suggesting that OxyR functions as an intracellular redox sensor rather than a peroxide sensor in this organism. A sod gene of Bacteroides fragilis, which is taxonomically related to P. gingivalis, is inducible by redox stresses but not controlled by its OxyR. A DNA fragment including the B. fragilis sod promoter region could bind the P. gingivalis OxyR protein; however, a putative OxyR binding sequence within the DNA fragment was 14 bases distant from a putative -35 box of its promoter.
TI  - Commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce Th1, Th2 or Treg differentiation.
AB  - In various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. Dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. The aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the T-lymphocyte response. To assess the T-lymphocyte response, the expression of CD25, CD69, intracellular interferon gamma (cIFN-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cIL-4) was determined. Dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. Monocytes were stimulated with IL-4 and GM-CSF and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. Cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. Lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Dendritic cells, primed with antigens of Bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation and expression of intercellular IFN-gamma by T lymphocytes compared to negative controls. The dendritic cells primed with antigens of P. acnes had no effect on T-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD25bright cells (regulatory T cells) with a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. Dendritic cells primed with antigens of S. mitis induced increased expression of cIL-4. We conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from B. fragilis, S. mitis, and P. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce Th1, Th2, and T(reg) differentiation, respectively. This may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.
TI  - Sixteen homologs of the mex-type multidrug resistance efflux pump in Bacteroides  fragilis.
AB  - Sixteen homologs of multidrug resistance efflux pump operons of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family were found in the Bacteroides fragilis genome sequence by homology searches. Disruption mutants were made to the mexB homologs of the four genes most similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa mexB. Reverse transcription-PCR was conducted and indicated that the genes were transcribed in a polycistronic fashion and that the promoter was upstream of bmeA (the mexA homolog). One of these disruption mutants (in bmeB, the mexB homolog) was more susceptible than the parental strain to certain cephems, polypeptide antibiotics, fusidic acid, novobiocin, and puromycin. The gene for this homolog and the adjacent upstream gene, bmeA, were cloned in a hypersensitive Escherichia coli host. The resultant transformants carrying B. fragilis bmeAB were more resistant to certain agents; these agents also had lower MICs for the B. fragilis bmeB disruption mutants than for the parental strain. The putative efflux pump operon is composed of bmeA, bmeB, and bmeC (a putative outer membrane channel protein homologous with OprM). Addition of the efflux pump inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (a proton conductor that eliminates the energy source) and Phe-Arg beta-naphthylamide (MC-207,110) (the first specific inhibitor described for RND pumps in P. aeruginosa), resulted in lowered MICs in the parental strain but not in the bmeB disruption mutant, indicating that the bmeB pump is affected by these inhibitors. This is the first description of RND type pumps in the genus Bacteroides.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of pulse dosing versus standard dosing: in vitro metronidazole activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  - Pulse dosing is a novel approach to dosing that produces escalating antibiotic levels early in the dosing interval followed by a prolonged dose-free period. Antibiotic is frontloaded by means of four sequential bolus injections, after which antibiotic levels are allowed to diminish until the next dose. This study compares standard thrice-daily dosing and pulse dosing of metronidazole against Bacteroides spp. in an in vitro model. Two American Type Culture Collection Bacteroides fragilis isolates (metronidazole MIC for each organism = 1 mg/liter) were exposed to metronidazole for 48 or 96 h. Human pharmacokinetics were simulated for an oral 500-mg dose given every 8 h (maximum concentration of drug [C(max)] = 12 mg/liter; half-life = 8 h; area under the curve [AUC] = 294 mg . h/liter) and for pulse dosing. Pulses, each producing an increase in metronidazole concentration of 9 mg/liter, were administered at times 0, 2, 4, and 6 h of each 24-h cycle, with a targeted half-life of 8 h (AUC = 347 mg . h/liter). A metronidazole-resistant B. fragilis strain (metronidazole MIC = 32 mg/liter) was exposed to both dosing regimens and, additionally, to a regimen of 1,500 mg administered once daily (C(max) = 36 mg/liter; AUC = 364 mg . h/liter). Furthermore, regimens against one B. fragilis isolate and one B. thetaiotaomicron isolate corresponding to one-fourth and one-eighth of the thrice-daily and pulse dosing regimens, mimicking peak metronidazole concentrations achieved in abscesses, were simulated in 48-h experiments (metronidazole MIC = 1 mg/liter). Time-kill curves were generated for each experiment and analyzed for bactericidal activity, defined as a bacterial burden reduction >/= 3 log(10) CFU/ml. The results of paired (Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test) and nonpaired (Mann-Whitney test) statistical analyses conducted on time to 3 log(10) kill data and area under the kill curve data from each of the thrice-daily dosing experiments versus each of the pulse dosing experiments were considered not significant for a given isolate-dosing regimen combination. The thrice-daily dosing, pulse dosing, and once-daily dosing regimens all exhibited bactericidal activity. Metronidazole administered in standard or pulse dosing fashion was highly active against both susceptible and resistant strains of Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Evidence for local production of antibodies to auto and non-self antigens in periodontal disease.
AB  - Autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to periodontal disease (PD) pathogenesis; autoantibody to collagen type 1 is produced at the periodontal site and local levels are found to be higher than in serum. OBJECTIVES: To find any evidence of autoimmune destruction in diseased periodontal tissues in patients with periodontitis. The study examines the relationship of antibodies to a self antigen collagen Type 1 and antigens from two periodontal pathogens namely Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and a non-oral bacterium Bacteroides fragilis (Bf) in disease sites and in serum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Granulomatous tissues from periodontally diseased sites and serum samples were obtained from 13 patients (15 sites) undergoing surgical therapy. Tissues were homogenized at 4 degrees C on Tris saline buffer [1 g (5 ml)-1], homogenate was centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were used in assays. Antibody to collagen and Aa, Pg and Bf in tissue eluates and serum were determined by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and conventional ELISA respectively using an alkaline phosphatase/p-nitrophenyl phosphate enzyme-substrate system. Sera from age and sex matched healthy subjects and pooled human serum were used as controls. Antibody (Ab) levels in tissues and serum were standardized by concomitant albumin assay. RESULTS: Level of antibodies to collagen type 1 in tissue was significantly higher than in serum (P = 0.0001). Antibody levels in tissue to Pg were significantly higher than in serum (P = 0.0271). Ab levels to both Aa and Bf in tissues and serum were not significantly different from each other. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the process of the local production of antibodies to autoantigen namely collagen type-1 and to bacterial antigens in the granulomatous tissues housed within the periodontal lesions in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin: the role of 3 newer fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and  show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and Bacteroides fragilis. These agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. The pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae. All 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. The toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. All 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. These agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the oral pathogenic Bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83.
AB  - The complete 2,343,479-bp genome sequence of the gram-negative, pathogenic oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83, a major contributor to periodontal disease, was determined. Whole-genome comparative analysis with other available complete genome sequences confirms the close relationship between the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum and the green-sulfur bacteria. Within the CFB phyla, the genomes most similar to that of P. gingivalis are those of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis. Outside of the CFB phyla the most similar genome to P. gingivalis is that of Chlorobium tepidum, supporting the previous phylogenetic studies that indicated that the Chlorobia and CFB phyla are related, albeit distantly. Genome analysis of strain W83 reveals a range of pathways and virulence determinants that relate to the novel biology of this oral pathogen. Among these determinants are at least six putative hemagglutinin-like genes and 36 previously unidentified peptidases. Genome analysis also reveals that P. gingivalis can metabolize a range of amino acids and generate a number of metabolic end products that are toxic to the human host or human gingival tissue and contribute to the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - [Two patients with fever, chills and pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant accompanied by hyperbilirubinaemia: pylephlebitis].
AB  - Two male patients aged 55 and 77 years, respectively, presented to the casualty department with fever, chills and right abdominal upper quadrant tenderness. They also had hyperbilirubinaemia. Based on CT scan findings and blood cultures yielding Bacteroides fragilis, a diagnosis of pylephlebitis (septic thrombophlebitis of the mesenteric veins and/or the portal vein) was made. This is a condition with a mortality rate of 10-70%. Primary sources such as diverticulitis are often seen in patients with pylephlebitis, in which bacteria are drained by the mesenteric veins and cause a thrombus in the portal system. In the two patients no primary focus was detected. They were treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics, and were discharged in good health. Pylephlebitis can be complicated by liver abscesses. Treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics which are adjusted based on the blood cultures results. The duration of treatment is between two and six weeks, depending on the presence of liver abscesses. In patients with abscesses that cannot be drained, longer treatment may be indicated.
TI  - Immunomodulatory consequences of oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Probiotic microorganisms, especially lactic acid bacteria, are effective in the treatment of infectious diarrhoeal diseases and experimental colitis. Although the mechanisms by which these organisms exert their anti-inflammatory effects are largely unknown, immunomodulating effects are suggested. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus subspecies GG (Lb. GG) on the cellular immune response to intestinal microorganisms in ten healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood cells (PB) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated Bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (Bfg) or Escherichia coli (Esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured in the culture supernatant. CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of intracellular ATP following lysis of the cells. The activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes towards isolated and heat-inactivated intestinal organisms was increased after the probiotic treatment. Additionally, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and in part IFN-gamma cytokine secretion by PB cells following stimulation with whole stool preparations and single members of the flora was significantly decreased, whereas the IL-10 and in part IL-4 cytokine secretion was increased at the end of the study. In contrast, the activational response of CD4+ T-lymphocytes following stimulation with whole 'non-self' intestinal flora was higher than by 'self' intestinal flora, but both responses showed a trend towards a reduction at the end of the study. This study documents a direct effect by Lb. GG on the cellular immune system of healthy volunteers and offers a promising tool to investigate systemic immunomodulation due to oral administration of probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Chemical structure and immunobiological activity of lipid A from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The novel chemical structure and immunobiological activities of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipid A were investigated. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparation of P. intermedia was extracted using a phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method, after which its purified lipid A was prepared by weak acid hydrolysis followed by chromatographic separations. The lipid A structure was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to be a diglucosamine backbone with a phosphate at the 4-position of the non-reducing side sugar, as well as five fatty acids containing branched long chains. It was similar to that of Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, except for the phosphorylation site. P. intermedia lipid A induced weaker cytokine production and NF-kappaB activation in murine cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as compared to Escherichia coli synthetic lipid A (compound 506). Our results indicate that P. intermedia lipid A activates cells through a TLR4-dependent pathway similar to E. coli-type lipid A, even though these have structural differences.
TI  - [Bactericidal activity of Trovafloxacin and Moxifloxacin against Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli].
AB  - Anaerobes are often involved in human pathology, including oral infections. The therapy of anaerobic infection requires certain antibiotics such as: metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. But the incidence of resistant strains among anaerobes is continuously increasing and it is necessary to find some new agents effective against these bacteria. The aim of our study was to establish the bactericidal activity of two new quinolones against 14 strains of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. The MIC of tested strains was first detected and then time-kill kinetics was determined by using Miles and Misra methodology. Ciprofloxacin was used as standard-quinolone. The results show that trovafloxacin and moxifloxacin have good activity against anaerobes, better than that of ciprofloxacin. Bactericidal curves suggest a rapid action of moxifloxacin (within the first 4 hours), but a prolonged cidal activity for trovafloxacin (24 hours). For both agents, the antimicrobial effect is concentration-dependent. As previous studies suggest, the new quinolones have good activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria so they are useful in the treatment of mixed infections (common feature of anaerobic infections).
TI  - High prevalence of cfxA beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - This prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. Three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. One to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the Prevotella genus (Bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; Prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). PCR assays were used to detect cfxA and cepA/cblA, the genes encoding class A/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the Bacteroides fragilis group. The present investigation confirmed the role of Prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. Additionally, this PCR screening showed (1): the high prevalence of CfxA beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepA/cblA (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxA in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to anal dilatation.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report of anaerobic vertebral osteomyelitis after anal dilatation. OBJECTIVES: To present a patient with monomicrobial anaerobic vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to a previously undescribed source of infection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A 17-year-old boy presented with low back pain 3 months after anal dilatation. METHODS: Physical examination, technetium-99m bone scan, plain radiograph, CT, and MRI studies of the lumbar spine were used to clinically diagnose lumbar osteomyelitis. Culture material from the involved disc was positive for Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: The patient recovered after 8 weeks of treatment with oral metronidazole. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides fragilis hematogenous osteomyelitis is a rare entity. This is the first reported case of such disease after anal dilatation.
TI  - Strain differentiation in Bacteroides fragilis by RAPD and Dendron computer-assisted gel analysis.
AB  - Batteroides fragilis is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from human infections. Strains of this species are not easily distinguished by phenotypic tests. It is important to make this distinction because virulence may vary between strains and because B. fragilis seems to be a heterogeneous species. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis for differentiation of 46 strains of B. fragilis. Twenty-seven of the strains belonged to Johnson's DNA homology group I and 8 to group II, while 11 strains had not been assigned to any of these groups (NI group). The primers OPA16 and 18 were chosen among 30 primers tested for optimal RAPD analysis. OPA18 gave best discrimination, revealing a total of 15 genotypes while OPA16 gave 13. The gels obtained after RAPD analysis were evaluated with the Dendron computer-assisted program. Most strains showed similarity levels (S(AB)) within 70%. Strain clusters thus established were not always in agreement with DNA homology since strains from both homology groups fell in the same cluster. Similarly, strains of the NI group fell among the group I and II homology strains. RAPD was useful for differentiation of B. fragilis strains and thus probably suitable for epidemiological studies. On the other hand, DNA-DNA homology, comparing the entire genome of strains rather than a few random priming sites, would be more reliable for taxonomy. Computer-assisted gel analysis made it possible to objectively evaluate multiple banding patterns, thereby increasing the reliability of the RAPD analysis.
TI  - Effects of single oral doses of gemifloxacin (320 milligrams) versus trovafloxacin (200 milligrams) on fecal flora in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Gemifloxacin and trovafloxacin were administered to 12 volunteers in a randomized crossover trial with a 2-week washout period. Stool samples were collected predose and 1, 2, and 3 days postdose. Both quinolones reduced the number of organisms of the family Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic gram-positive organisms. Escherichia coli reduction was greater with gemifloxacin than with trovafloxacin, with postdose isolation of quinolone-resistant strains for which MICs of trovafloxacin were higher than those of gemifloxacin.
TI  - Strain differentiation in Bacteroides fragilis by ribotyping and computer-assisted gel analysis.
AB  - It is important to distinguish between Bacteroides fragilis strains as their virulence may vary and as B. fragilis seems to be a heterogeneous species. The aim of our study was to evaluate ribotyping for differentiation of 46 strains of B. fragilis and for assessment of strain heterogeneity within and between the two DNA-DNA homology strain groups established in this species. Twenty-seven strains belonged to Johnson's DNA homology group I and eight to group II. Eleven strains had not been assigned to any group (NI group). DNA from all strains was cut with BglI, EcoRI and HindIII. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms were investigated using a non-radioactive digoxigenin-labelled cDNA probe transcribed from Escherichia coli 16S+23S rRNA. Ribotyping with BglI was most discriminatory, revealing a total of 26 different patterns by visual inspection of gels. EcoRI followed with 20 patterns and HindIII with 13 patterns. The gels from ribotyping were processed using the Dendron computer-assisted program. Strain clusters established using Dendron were not always in agreement with homology-based strain groups. Strains of the NI group fell into both homology groups. Ribotyping, as it is based on a relatively small portion of the genome, is useful for strain distinction in epidemiological studies with B. fragilis, whereas DNA-DNA homology, using the entire genome, is more reliable for taxonomy. The Dendron computer-assisted program, which enabled objective assessment of multiple banding patterns, increased the reliability of ribotyping.
TI  - Comparison of oral immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) metronidazole bactericidal activity against Bacteroides spp. using an in vitro model of infection.
AB  - We used an anaerobic infection model capable of simulating human serum pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), C(min), half-life, and AUC) to compare the activity of oral immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) MTZ formulations. Four oral regimens of MTZ plus a control regimen were simulated in the model: [i] (IR) 500 mg q8h, [ii] ER 750 mg q12h, [iii] ER 750 mg q24h, and [iv] ER 1500 mg q24h. Two clinical Bacteroides fragilis isolates (MICs 0.5, 4.0 microg/mL) and two non-fragilis Bacteroides isolates (MICs 0.5, 3 microg/mL) were studied. All four oral MTZ regimens exhibited rapid, bactericidal activity (> or =3-log(10) decrease from the starting inoculum) within 12 h against both fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides isolates. Overall, no appreciable difference in the rate of bacteria killing was noted among the four MTZ formulations against either B. fragilis isolates (P = 0.907, 0.737) or non-fragilis isolates (P = 0.809, 0.768). We conclude that ER MTZ dosed at 12 or 24-h intervals possesses equivalent bactericidal activity to standard IR MTZ dosed every eight hours against susceptible Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Identification and cloning of genes from Porphyromonas gingivalis after mutagenesis with a modified Tn4400 transposon from Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. Previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the Bacteroides transposon Tn4351. Characterization of Tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing Tn4351. In this study, we mutagenized P. gingivalis with a modified version of the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4400. Plasmid pYT646B carrying the transposon was mobilized from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 by conjugation. Both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). However, the inverse transposon (Tn4400') contains a pBR322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus, the cloning of disrupted genomic DNAs from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into E. coli. Thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by Southern hybridization. By this procedure the disrupted genes from P. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.
TI  - [An experimental study of the patterns in the development of an inflammatory process in the mandibular bone tissue caused by exposure to anaerobic microflora].
AB  - Inflammatory process in mandibular bone was induced in 39 outbred rats by a pure  culture of Bacteroides fragilis and by an associative culture of B. fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Anaerobic microflora notably aggravated the course of inflammation. In contrast to inflammation in other parts of the skeleton, inflammation of the jaws involves a high risk of infection of the oral cavity by pathogenic microflora. A variety of microorganisms is isolated from the focus: from gram-positive staphylococci to gram-negative enterobacteria, which fact should be borne in mind when planning antibiotic therapy. Combined use of antibiotics active towards the entire spectrum of agents detected in this study is the most effective.
TI  - Activities of the Porphyromonas gingivalis PrtP proteinase determined by construction of prtP-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in Bacteroides species.
AB  - PrtP is a major cysteine proteinase of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The gene encoding this proteinase, prtP, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vectors pFD288 and pFD340 and was expressed in Bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pFD288, or a Bacteroides promoter present on pFD340. Proteolytically active PrtP was detected by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several Bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. The proteinase was recovered from Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. Lys-amidolytic activity, but not Arg-amidolytic activity, was detected. PrtP was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. It also was inhibited by Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and, to a lesser extent, H-D-Tyr-L-Pro-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (YPRCK) and was relatively insensitive to EDTA and leupeptin. Neither B. fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells nor the CHAPS extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. Furthermore, P. gingivalis W12, ATCC 33277, KDP110, and HG66 with knockout mutations in prtP were constructed by allelic replacement. Unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. These strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a Lys-specific peptide substrate. This report presents the results of the first characterization of the PrtP proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other P. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of P. gingivalis cells defective in the production of PrtP.
TI  - The translational hop junction and the 5' transcriptional start site for the Prevotella loescheii adhesin encoded by plaA.
AB  - The Prevotella loescheii adhesin gene, plaA, contains a coding gap between a small open reading frame (ORF-1) and a large open reading frame (ORF-2). Translation of the plaA mRNA requires bypassing this 29-nt coding gap on the plaA transcript. We have determined the N-terminal peptide sequence of the SO34 adhesin beyond the gap sequence. This sequence shows that the peptide junction between ORF-1 and ORF-2 is continuous in the adhesin and supports the conclusion that synthesis of the SO34 adhesin occurs by a ribosomal hop mechanism. To elucidate upstream signals, we used the 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) technique to map the start point of the plaA mRNA. DNA sequencing of plasmids with the 5' RACE products placed the 5' end of plaA mRNA 270 nt upstream from the plaA start codon. A region corresponding to a Bacteroides fragilis promoter consensus sequence precedes this start site.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive assay for detection of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis is an obligatory anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium found among the normal intestinal flora of humans. Enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis (ETBF) have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. The enterotoxin of ETBF induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal segments and cytotoxic response in HT29/C1 cells. By using a pair of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs; MAb C3 and MAb 4H8) specific for the lipopolysaccharide of B. fragilis, an assay based on immunomagnetic separation (IMS) in combination with PCR (IMS-PCR) was developed. After DNA extraction, a 294-bp fragment was amplified. The specificity of the IMS-PCR assay was evaluated by adding previously isolated and confirmed ETBF strains to normal fecal samples. All fecal samples to which ETBF strains were added were positive, showing a 100% specificity. The spiked fecal samples were also used for evaluation of the sensitivity of the assay. The detection limit was found to be approximately 50 CFU/g of feces. By this method 10 clinical fecal samples (5 from patients with diarrhea and 5 from healthy controls) were examined. The results of PCR were in accordance with the results of the HT29/C1 cell assay for all samples. The minimum time to retrieval of the final result by the IMS-PCR method is 36 h. The proposed IMS-PCR assay is rapid and sensitive for the direct detection of ETBF in stool samples.
TI  - [The application of a transponson, Tn4351, to an oral anaerobe, Porphyromonas gingivalis].

TI  - In vitro activities of E1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - E1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. E1101 was the most active agent against S. agalactiae and E. coli. Since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, E1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Absence of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis and Chlamydia pneumoniae in human subgingival plaque.
AB  - Little is known about the presence of common medical pathogens in the human oral  cavity. Using a 16S rRNA-based PCR identification method, this study determined the occurrence of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis and Chlamydia pneumoniae in subgingival plaque from 50 adults with advanced periodontitis. Each patient contributed samples from 3 deep periodontal pockets collected by paper points. The PCR primers were for P. asaccharolytica 5'-CTC TAG CTA GAG TGT ACT GG-3' and 5'-ATA GGG TTT ATA GAT TAG CTC TCT-3', for B. fragilis 5'-AAT GAT TCC GCA TGG TTT CAT TA-3' and 5'-GCG GTG ATT GCT CAC TGA CA-3', and for C. pneumoniae 5'- TGA CAA CTG TAG AAA TAC AGC-3' and 5'-CGC CTC TCT CCT ATA AAT-3'. The primers yielded a single amplicon with the respective reference strains and produced no amplicon with colonies of 25 groups of oral organisms. None of the three test species were detected in any of the 50 pooled subgingival samples tested. P. asaccharyolytica, B. fragilis and C. pneumoniae do not seem to be part of the periodontopathic microbiota in humans.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - News & notes: adhesiveness of Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from feces of healthy donors, abscesses, and blood.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis strains attached to oral epithelial cells (ECs) and the cell line Intestine 407 and associated with human phagocytes with different efficiencies depending on their source. The 58%, 75%, and 40% of strains isolated from feces, abscesses, and blood respectively adhered to ECs with good efficiency (11-40 bacteria/cell). Of the strains from feces and abscesses, 17% and 20% exhibited a high adherence (>40 bacteria/cell); however, none of the blood isolates presented this property. Similar results were obtained with the cell line Intestine 407 and human phagocytes. Of the isolates from feces, abscesses, and blood, 20%, 56%, and 71% respectively also exhibited hemagglutination ability, indicating that this property is a virulence trait more frequently present among pathogenic isolates than in commensal strains.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of low-dose clindamycin administered at 8- and 12-hour intervals against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Twelve volunteers received 300 mg of clindamycin intravenously (i.v.) or orally (p.o.) administered every 8 h (q8h) or q12h by random assignment over four study periods. Serum bactericidal titers were determined for each regimen against two isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (one penicillin-sensitive isolate and one penicillin-resistant isolate), and Bacteroides fragilis. The duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval (expressed as a percentage of the dosing interval) was determined for each isolate. No significant differences in the duration of activity were observed between i.v. and p.o. regimens dosed according to the same interval (P > 0.05). All regimens provided bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae for 100% of their respective dosing intervals. Against B. fragilis, bactericidal activity was observed for greater than 80% of the dosing interval for each of the regimens. Although a statistically significant difference favoring the q8h i.v. regimen (P < 0.05) was detected, this difference is not believed to be clinically significant. The q8h and q12h regimens provided measurable bactericidal activity against S. aureus for greater than 85 and 50% of the dosing intervals, respectively (P < 0.001). Clindamycin dosed at 300 mg i.v. or p.o., q8h or q12h, provides adequate coverage against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and B. fragilis.
TI  - Comparison of lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Campylobacter and Wolinella spp. by tricine-SDS-PAGE.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera Bacteroides (B. fragilis), Prevotella (Pr. melaninogenica), Porphyromonas (Po. gingivalis), Campylobacter (C. fetus subsp. fetus), and Wolinella (W. succinogenes), and from the type strains of B. distasonis, B. forsythus, B. ureolyticus, Po. levii, Po. macacae, and C. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (Westphal method). S-form LPSs, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Lipid A was not stained. Also profiles from LPS of Escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:B4 and 055:B5, could be distinguished. While W. succinogenes showed a relatively short S-form LPS on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including B. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder LPSs. Po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest O-chain. The long O-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of DU-6859a and other fluoroquinolones against  Japanese isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis. DU-6859a was the most active agent; it inhibited 90% of isolates of almost all species tested, including Bacteroides fragilis at < or = 0.39 micrograms/mL. Although the other quinolones tested were active against gram-positive anaerobes, inhibiting their growth at < or = 1.56 micrograms/mL, these agents were less active against the B. fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (90% of which were inhibited at > or = 6.25 micrograms/mL). Mobiluncus species and G. vaginalis, which are well associated with bacterial vaginosis, were inhibited by DU-6859a at 0.1 microgram/mL. These results suggest that DU-6859a is a promising oral agent for the treatment of bacterial infections due to anaerobic bacteria; however, further studies, including determination of vaginal levels of this compound, should be performed to study the role of DU-6859a in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Detection and prevalence of the tetracycline resistance determinant Tet Q in the  microbiota associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with a history of moderate to severe adult periodontitis and enumerated on Trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml. Each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene tet(Q) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA hybridization, using a fragment of tetA(Q)2 from Bacteroides fragilis 1126. PCR primers (5'-GGCTTCTACGACATCTATTA-3' and 5'-CATCAACATTTATCTCTCTG-3') were chosen to amplify a 755 bp region of tet(Q). The subgingival plaque samples were also tested by PCR. Approximately 12% of the total cultivable flora was resistant to tetracycline, and the percentage of the tetracycline-resistant cultivable flora with the tet(Q) gene varied greatly from one patient to another with a range from 0.0 to 67%. Half of the 68 subgingival plaque samples were positive or weakly positive for tet(Q) by PCR. Approximately 15% of the 210 isolates subcultured with resistance to tetracycline, (> or = 4 micrograms/ml) contained tet(Q), and 60% contained tet(M). All of the tet(Q)-resistant isolates were gram-negative anaerobic bacilli and included all of the Prevotella and Bacteroides isolates.
TI  - Characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates following active immunization with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Periodontal disease is an infectious disease manifested by the progressive change of a healthy resident commensal microbiota to a pathogenic one characterized by a specific microbiota. Thus, the prospect for the use of selected bacteria or their antigens as a vaccine to interfere with the microbial changes and resulting progression of periodontal tissue destruction has been proposed. As a first step in examining the use of bacterial antigens as immunogens in periodontitis, this study characterized the humoral immune response in Macaca fascicularis after systemic immunization with intact Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Bacteroides fragilis. Parental immunization of the nonhuman primate with the intact bacteria resulted in the production of specific and significantly elevated levels of antibodies to P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, with the predominant isotype being immunoglobulin G (IgG). In contrast, the principal response to the nonoral, intestinal bacterium, B. fragilis, was of the IgM isotype. Immunization increased IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody by 14-227 fold to P. gingivalis and 8-108 fold to P. intermedia. The level of serum IgA antibody increased (77-227 fold). The kinetics of the antibody response post-immunization and post-ligation differed with respect to each of the bacteria tested. IgG antibody to P. gingivalis increased through week 16 of the experiment and remained elevated above baseline through week 32. The IgG antibody level to P. intermedia peaked at 4 weeks following the third immunization and decreased post-ligation to near baseline levels by week 16. Characterization of the immune response after active immunization in the nonhuman primate has demonstrated a substantial and specific increase in antibody response which was sustained for several weeks. The insights obtained from these studies should help optimize the potential for immunologic interference with progressing periodontitis.
TI  - Recent advances in antibiotic regimens for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections.
AB  - This paper reviews new information on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic infections. The bacteriology of these infections is complex, reflecting the bacteria that usually colonize the vagina and cervix. In general, these infections are polymicrobial in nature: the most frequently isolated microorganisms are gram-negative facultative aerobes, anaerobes, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic regimens that do provide coverage of these pathogens showed unacceptably high failure rates. A review of the studies recently published confirmed the recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for severe (inpatients) and mild-to-moderate (outpatients) pelvic inflammatory disease infections. In the case of severe infections, two regimens are recommended: a second-generation cephalosporin like cefoxitin or cefotetan, plus doxycycline or clindamycin/gentamicin. In the case of mild-to-moderate infection, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus doxycycline, or oral clindamycin plus an oral quinolone are recommended. Such studies produce high bacteriologic and clinical success rates. New studies indicate that gentamicin may be replaced with a monobactam such as aztreonam; this regimen leads to slightly better efficacy and less toxicity. The possibility of using clindamycin and a quinolone antibiotic is also discussed.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219), a new quinolone with extended activities against gram-positive pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The interesting in vitro antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of the new quinolone trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) warranted further studies to determine its in vivo efficacy in models of infectious disease. The significance of the pharmacokinetic and in vitro antimicrobial profiles of trovafloxacin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models by employing primarily oral therapy. Against acute infections, trovafloxacin was consistently more effective than temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens while maintaining activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative organisms. In a model of murine pneumonia, trovafloxacin was more efficacious than temafloxacin, while ciprofloxacin failed against S. pneumoniae (50% protective doses, 2.1, 29.5, and >100 mg/kg, respectively). In addition to its inherent in vitro potency advantage against S. pneumoniae, these data were supported by a pharmacokinetic study that showed levels of trovafloxacin in pulmonary tissue of S. pneumoniae-infected CF1 mice to be considerably greater than those of temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin (twice the maximum drug concentration in serum; two to three times the half-life, and three to six times the area under the concentration-time curve). Against localized mixed anaerobic infections, trovafloxacin was the only agent to effectively reduce the numbers of recoverable CFU of Bacteroides fragilis ( >1,000-fold), Staphylococcus aureus (1,000-fold), and Escherichia coli ( >100-fold) compared with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of trovafloxacin and its pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals provide support for the ongoing and planned human phase II and III clinical trials.
TI  - Comparison of the pharmacodynamic activity of cefotaxime plus metronidazole with  cefoxitin and ampicillin plus sulbactam.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of three drug regimens: cefotaxime plus metronidazole, cefoxitin, and ampicillin-sulbactam against two organisms frequently isolated in intraabdominal infection, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. DESIGN: Open-label, three-way crossover study. SETTING: Hartford Hospital Clinical Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Nine healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received the following regimens: (1) a single 1-g intravenous dose of cefotaxime plus a single 500-mg oral dose of metronidazole; (2) two intravenous doses of cefoxitin, 2 g each dose given every 6 hours; and (3) two intravenous doses of ampicillin-sulbactam, 3 g each dose given every 6 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum bactericidal titers and drug concentrations were measured over a 12-hour period. The cefotaxime-metronidazole regimen showed superior activity against E. coli compared with ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin. The mean areas under the bactericidal activity curve (AUBC) for the three regimens were 550.2, 68.7, and 48.9, respectively (p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in AUBC among the three regimens for B. fragilis. Serum concentrations of cefotaxime remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for E. coli significantly longer than did concentrations of ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0023, respectively). Serum concentrations of metronidazole were still at 9 times the MIC for B. fragilis at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval; for ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoxitin concentrations remained above the MIC for one-half and less than one-fourth, respectively, of the dosing interval (p < 0.0001). The ratio of AUC:MIC was also favorable for metronidazole (212.2) compared with 63.4 for ampicillin-sulbactam and 9.2 for cefoxitin. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cefotaxime-metronidazole, even at the relatively low doses used in this study, provides coverage against gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens that is at least as effective as that of cefoxitin and ampicillin-sulbactam. In addition, its cost is considerably less expensive than that of the other regimens.
TI  - Comparison of rufloxacin and norfloxacin effects on faecal flora.
AB  - The suppression of faecal Escherichia coli by quinolones was studied in a randomized cross-over phase I trial with single oral doses of 400 mg rufloxacin or norfloxacin. Both drugs caused > 70% decontamination in a similar number of subjects in the 72 h post-dose period (83% vs 100% respectively), but suppression of E. coli at 168 h was significantly (P < 0.05) higher after rufloxacin (83.3 vs 40%).
TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis and parotid abscess in children.
AB  - Acute suppurative parotitis and parotid gland abscess are infrequently encountered among children. Fourteen children were diagnosed in the Sheba Medical Center as suffering from these infections and their clinical features are described. Discussion reveals neither significant differences nor predominating factors to differentiate between these two entities.
TI  - IS1139 from Streptococcus salivarius: identification and characterization of an insertion sequence-like element related to mobile DNA elements from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - An insertion sequence-like element, IS1139, was cloned and sequenced from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 chromosome. This insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. This IS possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of IS1161 from S. salivarius ATCC 25975, IS4351 from Bacteroides fragilis, IS30 from Escherichia coli, and IS1086 from Alcaligenes eutrophus. Sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. Southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpA), revealed that IS1139 is found in two strains of S. salivarius, ATCC 25975 and ATCC 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.
TI  - The role of neuraminidase in haemagglutination and adherence to colon WiDr cells  by Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The role of neuraminidase in haemagglutination and adherence to colon WiDr cells  by eight strains of Bacteroides fragilis and four strains of oral black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes was studied. Neuraminidase treatment resulted in a very small increase of haemagglutination by some of the strains but had no effect on adherence to WiDr cells by all bacterial strains tested except one strain of Prevotella intermedia (HG 110). Inhibition of neuraminidase had no effect on haemagglutination or adherence, nor was any correlation found between haemagglutinating ability and neuraminidase activity in the B. fragilis strain. The results indicated that haemagglutination and adherence of B. fragilis to WiDr cells were not mediated by neuraminidase.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in human oral and intestinal anaerobic microfloras.
AB  - In the present study we determined the resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria  from human saliva and stool specimens and investigated whether there were significant differences in resistance between outpatients and hospitalized patients, regardless of whether they had received antimicrobial agents. No bacterial strains resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, imipenem, clindamycin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole were isolated from the saliva samples. However, resistance to ampicillin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime was found in strains from 70% of the fecal samples (mainly Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium innocuum, and Bacteroides ovatus). Resistance to both ampicillin and cefuroxime was frequently found in 19% of the isolated strains (mainly B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and Bacteroides vulgatus). No strains that were resistant to imipenem, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole were found. Hospitalization and/or intake of antimicrobial agents was associated with an increase in the relative number of resistant anaerobic intestinal bacteria. The percentage of resistant anaerobic strains encountered, compared with the total number of anaerobic bacteria in the normal fecal microflora, was between 5.2 and 14.8%, with the lower value associated with the outpatient group. Two-thirds of the resistant strains from this group had a relative frequency of less than 1% of the total anaerobic flora, while one-third of the strains were present at a level of greater than 1%; for the hospitalized patients, two-thirds of the strains were present at a level of greater than 1%, and one-third of the strains were present at a level of less than 1% (P < 0.001). Patients who had received antimicrobial agents for 6 days or more (n=20) had an average of 1.6 resistant anaerobic strains each, while patients treated for 3 to 5 days (n = 30) had a mean number of 0.87 resistant strains each ( P < 0.05).
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - [Subcutaneous abscess formation in the mice inoculated intragastrically with Bacteroides fragilis].
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis when inoculated intragastrically induced abscess formation in the mice of which the intestinal microbial flora had been disturbed by the prior intake of streptomycin and erythromycin in their drinking water. The lesion usually developed at the left axillary lymph node one week after inoculation and persisted for at least two months. Without the antibiotic treatment, B. fragilis did not induce such abscess formation. Although B. fragilis was isolated from blood after inoculation, intravenous administration of B. fragilis into mice did not induce the abscess formation. Therefore, B. fragilis inoculated did not appear to spread from the intestine to the distant locus via the bloodstream. The number of B. fragilis in the mesenteric lymph nodes reached 10(5) colony-forming units per lymph node 6 h after oral administration and remained unchanged over a 24-h period of infection. These results suggest that the lymphatic dissemination of B. fragilis accounts for the abscess formation at the left axillary lymph node.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from University departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. Susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified Wilkins-Chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. Anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the University departments were mainly resistant Bacteroides spp., especially Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, Peptostreptococcus spp, Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. The study shows that the members of most Bacteroides spp. encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.
TI  - Classification and typing methods of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  - Until recently, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes were classified as 'black-pigmented Bacteroides'. At present, 11 distinct species are recognized in this group. Because of major differences with Bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus Bacteroides, new genera have been proposed: Porphyromonas for three asaccharolytic species, and Prevotella for the saccharolytic species. Typing methods have been developed for some species of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes. These include biotyping and serotyping, but relatively few types can be distinguished with these methods. Recently, DNA restriction endonuclease analysis has been used for typing of P. gingivalis, Pr. intermedia and P. endodontalis strains. Great heterogeneity was observed within all three species. This typing method can be useful for epidemiological studies.
TI  - Comparative chemotherapeutic activity of temafloxacin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, imipenem and ampicillin/sulbactam against Bacteroides fragilis in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model.
AB  - The new fluorinated 4-quinolone temafloxacin was compared with cefoxitin, clindamycin, imipenem (with or without cilastatin) and ampicillin/sulbactam in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model of Bacteroides fragilis infection. Based upon in-vitro susceptibility data, temafloxacin may represent an effective oral and parenteral alternative to standard oral and parenteral anti-anaerobic agents currently in use. Temafloxacin therapy with dosage regimens of < 200 mg/kg/day typically yielded 2-3 x log10 reductions in cfu/abscess, similar to ampicillin/sulbactam, while cefoxitin and clindamycin were generally unable to produce similar reductions at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Imipenem (with or without cilastatin) was unable to produce a 1 x log10 reduction at doses of 400 mg/kg/day. This study suggests that temafloxacin has potential for the treatment of anaerobic or mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections in man.
TI  - Chromosomal DNA probes for the identification of Bacteroides tectum and Bacteroides fragilis from the oral cavity of cats.
AB  - A dot-blot hybridisation assay using high molecular weight DNA as whole chromosomal probes was used to differentiate Bacteroides tectum from Bacteroides fragilis. 32P-labelled probes were compared with digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes. The whole chromosomal probes were specific--differentiating B. tectum from B. fragilis and both from a variety of other species (including other members of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Prevotella) found in normal and abnormal mouths of cats and horses. However, even at very high stringencies, B. tectum homology groups I, II and III were not distinguishable from one another using either 32P-labelled or DIG-labelled probes. Thus, DIG-labelled whole chromosome probes directed against cellular DNA released directly onto nitrocellulose membranes is considered a useful method for diagnostic veterinary laboratories wishing to identify B. tectum and distinguish it from B. fragilis and other oral anaerobic flora of cats.
TI  - [Biological activity of Bacteroides fragilis].
AB  - The investigation was performed with 9 strains of B. fragilis isolated from pregnant women in their 38th week of pregnancy, strain IPLE 323 obtained from France, strains BE17 and BE61 obtained from Netherlands and a strain 210 isolated from a case of appendicitis. The strains were identified by indirect immunofluorescence method and by API 32 ATB test. Ability to adhere to epithelium of oral cavity and vaginal mucosa and sheep and human erythrocytes was investigated. Susceptibility to antibiotics was also measured. It was found that strains isolated from vagina easier adhere to epithelial cells of vagina than to cheek epithelium and erythrocytes.
TI  - [Immunomodulating properties of various microbes--representatives of normal intestinal microflora].
AB  - The impact of oral administration of heat-killed bifidobacteria, lactobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides on mouse resistance to experimental salmonellosis and content of immunoglobulin-synthesizing cells in the proper plate of the small intestine was studied. It was shown that the administration of the killed bifidobacteria, lactobacteria and enterococci increased the animal resistance to experimental salmonellosis infection and induced an increase in the content of immunoglobulin-synthesizing cells in the proper plate of the small intestine. The administration of the killed bacteroides had no such effect. Possible development of bacterial preparations with immunomodulating properties based on killed bifidobacteria, lactobacteria or enterococci is discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of Ro 40-6890, Ro 41-3399, and other antimicrobial  agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the ester Ro 41-3399 and its free active acid Ro 40-6890 was tested against 189 strains of anaerobic bacteria in comparison to other oral cephalosporins and to antimicrobial agents established in the treatment of anaerobic infections. Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium and Clostridium spp. were susceptible to Ro 40-6890, with few exceptions. Due to its lack of activity against the major pathogens of the Bacteriodes fragilis group, Ro 40-6890 does not promise to be of major use in the treatment of infections caused by anaerobes.
TI  - Cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis.
AB  - A case of cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis is reported. The resulting treatment was successful but disfiguring. The diagnosis and management of this condition is discussed with particular regard to features which might allow earlier diagnosis.
TI  - Comparative mitogenicity and polyclonal B cell activation capacity of eight oral  or nonoral bacterial lipopolysaccharides in cultures of spleen cells from athymic (nu/nu-BALB/c) and thymic (BALB/c) mice.
AB  - Optimal stimulatory doses of purified phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides  (LPS) from 5 selected strains of 3 putative periodontopathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Veillonella), 3 strains of 2 nonoral bacterial species (Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella enteritidis), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced significantly higher maximum mitogenic responses and polyclonal Ig production in cultures of unfractionated spleen cells from nu/nu-BALB/c (nude) than from BALB/c (normal) mice. Compared with PWM, the LPS were stronger mitogens showing relative mitogenic capacities: B. fragilis LPS greater than F. nucleatum LPS greater than S. enteritidis LPS, Veillonella LPS, and P. intermedia LPS. B. fragilis LPS was the most and S. enteritidis LPS the least effective polyclonal B cell activator of total Ig, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA, and IgM secretion. IgG1 was not detected. P. intermedia LPS was the strongest IgA inducer. Kinetic observations indicated mitogenic responses and polyclonal B cell activation in a close sequential order in nude and normal cells. The LPS were potent Ag- and T cell-independent polyclonal B cell activators and LPS of subgingival plaque bacteria may therefore play a nonspecific role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like activity of Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from marmosets.
AB  - The ability of strains of the B. fragilis group, isolated from the oral cavity and intestine of marmosets, to produce bacteriorin-like substances in solid medium, in terms of auto-, iso- and heteroantagonism, was evaluated. Antagonistic activity was exhibited by 52% of the intestinal strains, 3 of which showed autoantagonistic activity. Three out of 9 oral strains isolated, tested against themselves, showed simultaneous isoantagonism to 4 indicator strains; but not autoantagonism. The same 9 oral strains, when tested against 16 reference strains, revealed interspecific activity only against 2 Gram-positive microorganisms. Higher activity, evaluated by the size of the inhibition halo, was observed in BHI-S agar, and greatest inhibition was obtained after 72 h of incubation.
TI  - The use of bacteriophages of Bacteroides fragilis as indicators of the efficiency of virucidal products.
AB  - The potential use of bacteriophage B40-8 of Bacteroides fragilis for the evaluation of the virucidal activity of antiseptics or disinfectants was investigated. The antiviral activity of two antiseptics and two disinfectants was evaluated according to a standard guideline. The effect of the virucidal agents was assessed on (i) viruses usually spread by direct contact with surfaces with contaminated secretions, i.e. herpes virus 1 and 2, and vaccinia virus, and (ii) viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route, i.e. hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, adenovirus and rotavirus. The survival of B40-8 always equalled or exceeded that of the animal viruses tested. Our data suggest the use of bacteriophage B40-8 to complement the information furnished by some standardized methods in ascertaining the antiviral activity of virucidal preparations.
TI  - The comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. Canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides gingivalis or Bacteroides fragilis. After treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. All test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. The combined data for Pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for S. mutans and B. gingivalis or B. fragilis but showed no difference for A. viscosus.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in irreversible hydrocolloid impression material and gingival retraction cord.
AB  - This study tested two dental materials in factory-sealed containers for the presence of bacteria that may be a source of infection. Twenty samples of two dental materials found to have contamination in a pilot study were taken from unopened containers using a sterile technique. The samples were inoculated onto chocolate agar plates and into thioglycolate broths with appropriate controls. Plates were examined, colonies were enumerated, Gram stained, and identified. The resulting contamination frequencies were compared for statistical significance using Fisher's exact test. Organisms were isolated from 10% of the negative inoculation control agar plates, while none of the control broths showed contamination. The alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) showed contamination in 50% of the plates and in 65% of the broths (p less than 0.05). The retraction cord had a small sample size and yielded organisms on 5% of the sample plates and in 20% of the thioglycolate broths (p greater than 0.05).
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria in oral infections of dental origin. The characteristics of Bacteroides species and diagnosis].
AB  - Pyogenic orofacial infections are generally the result of a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection. The aerobic germ, particularly the Bacteroides, have a prevailing role, even though their etiopathogenetic role is not clear yet.
TI  - [Studies on suppurative lesion and bone distribution of peroral antimicrobial agents (LAPC and TFLX) to experimental infected rabbits].
AB  - The models of infection in the rabbits mandible using Streptococcus milleri and Bacteroides fragilis by the method of Satoh-Heimdahl were prepared. A penicillic peroral antimicrobial agent, lenamipicillin (LAPC), and pyridone carboxylic acid peroral antimicrobial agent, tosufloxacin tosilate (TFLX), were administered to infected and healthy groups. Drug concentrations in the serum, pus, mandible, maxilla, humerus, sternum, costa, ilium, femur, tibia, liver, and kidney were determined by a biological method. The data were submitted to pharmacodynamic analysis and compared. The following results were obtained. The concentration of LAPC in the serum and various bone tissues was 1.2-6.4 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. The concentration of TFLX in the serum and bone tissues was 1.1-3.7 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. Moreover, concentrations in the liver 1.1-fold and 2.1-fold higher in the infectious group than in the healthy group in the LAPC and TFLX administration groups, respectively, and 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold higher in the kidney in the LAPC and TFLX groups, respectively. Both LAPC and TFLX diffused to the pus more satisfactorily than to the serum. The Cmax ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.48 and 1.81 for LAPC and TFLX, respectively, and the AUC ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.31 and 1.62 in LAPC and TFLX, respectively. These results indicated that both LAPC and TFLX are distributed satisfactorily to the local foci in the mandible, and that their systemic diffusion exerted immediate clinical effects.
TI  - Role of neuraminidase-dependent adherence in Bacteroides fragilis attachment to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Of 50 B. fragilis strains isolated from clinical samples we have demonstrated that 24 (48%) possess an adhesin that mediates a neuraminidase-dependent attachment of B. fragilis to mammalian epithelial cells, but does not mediate any association with human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. This ligand interacts with a mammalian cell receptor that contains a galactoside residue, exposed after neuraminidase pretreatment. Our results suggest a possible role for cell associated neuraminidase in mediating a two step adherence mechanism.
TI  - Prevotella, a new genus to include Bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus Bacteroides.
AB  - It was recently proposed that the genus Bacteroides should be restricted to Bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus). By contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral Bacteroides species, which include B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus Bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. Therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, Prevotella. The type species is Prevotella melaninogenica.
TI  - Metronidazole resistant Bacteroides fragilis infection of a prosthetic hip joint.
AB  - A case of infection involving a prosthetic joint in a patient with adult Still's  Disease is described. The causative organism was a strain of Bacteroides fragilis which was resistant to metronidazole. The rarity of this occurrence is emphasised. Diagnostic difficulties which arose are described and the problems encountered with therapy discussed.
TI  - Detection of conjugal transfer systems in oral, black-pigmented Bacteroides spp.
AB  - Oral, black-pigmented Bacteroides spp. are important pathogens in oral anaerobic  infections and dental disease. We detected conjugation systems in isolates of Bacteroides denticola and Bacteroides intermedius that transferred tetracycline resistance (Tetr) and penicillin resistance to Bacteroides buccae and to Bacteroides fragilis, an intestinal Bacteroides species. A cloned Tetr gene from B. fragilis hybridized to the transferable Tetr locus in the oral strains, indicating that genetic exchange occurs between these two groups of anaerobes.
TI  - Correlation of the extravascular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin with in-vivo efficacy in models of localized infection.
AB  - Infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. In-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the MIC and tissue levels generally above the MIC at time of challenge and during the course of infection. The efficacy of azithromycin against a Salmonella enteritidis oral challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. The significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. Ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). In another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized Staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. Extravascular fluid levels of azithromycin were greater than the MIC of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the MIC at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. Serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the MIC at the time of challenge. The antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of Staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, P less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. The significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with Escherichia coli or a mixture of Staph. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Isolation and identification of strains of Bacteroides fragilis group from the digestive tract of Callithrix penicillata marmosets.
AB  - Thirty-five strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group were isolated from oral and intestinal samples from 5 wild caught, captive Callithrix penicillata. Nine oral strains of Bacteroides fragilis (7) and Bacteroides distasonis (2), and 26 intestinal strains of Bacteroides fragilis (14) and Bacteroides distasonis (12) were identified.
TI  - [Study on the formation of experimental infected rabbit].
AB  - The purpose of the present study is to produce a model of infections of oral cavity by inducing abscess in the mandibla of New Zealand White rabbits as close to the oral cavity infection site as possible in order to determine whether the administered antimicrobial agents will transfer to the localized inflammatory foci. The pus to be collected should be 0.5 to 1.0g or more to permit bioassay and it should be collectable under nearly uniform conditions at all times. New Zealand White rabbit was the experimental animal used, in which anesthesia was induced intraperitoneally to expose the mandibula. A hole was made in the mandibula, into which a small cotton pellet inoculated with Streptococcus milleri and Bacteroides fragilis, whose cell concentrations had been adjusted to 10(8)CFU/ml, was implanted and the opening was carefully closed with sutures tightly. These two species of bacteria had been selected because mixtures of gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated in most cases from the occluded abscess of oral cavity infections. As a result of the above procedure, it was found that one week after production of the infected model animal, the abscess contained adequate volume of, pus for collection and demonstrated viability of the two transplanted species of bacteria. This animal model was considered an ideal model for use in the studies on treatment of infections in the oral cavity by administering antimicrobial agents to determine the extent of drug transfer into the pus and bones where purulent foci are present.
TI  - Activity of FCE 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic activity of FCE 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. In experimental pneumonia FCE 22891 was the most active antibiotic. In aerobic abscesses FCE 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against Str. pyogenes. In abscesses caused by Gram-negative bacteria, FCE 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. Cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant Esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of Ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. Cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against Gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of Ent. cloacae. FCE 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by Bacteroides fragilis 101. We conclude that FCE 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
TI  - Bacteroides species from the oral cavity and oral-associated diseases of cats.
AB  - One hundred and sixty-seven strains of Bacteroides were isolated from 71 subcutaneous fight-wound abscesses of cats, 21 cases of feline pyothorax, normal gingival margins from 10 cats and 6 cases of feline gingivitis. Bacteroides species constituted (as a proportion of all anaerobic isolates examined) 44.5% from subcutaneous abscesses, 33.7% from pyothoraxes, 37.5% from normal gingiva and 27.7% from diseased gingiva. Bacteroides tectum comprised 43.7% or 73 of 167 strains, followed by the black- or brown-pigmented asaccharolytic feline species of B. gingivalis, B. salivosus and Group B, comprising 32.3% or 54 of 167 strains. B. heparinolyticus (some 10% or 17 of 167 strains) was the next most common species described. The remainder consisted of two strains of B. fragilis and 21 unspeciated strains. Bacteroides tectum was frequently isolated from subcutaneous abscesses (43.7%) and pyothoraxes (46.6%), and it constituted some 33% of anaerobic isolated from normal gingiva. Bacteroides heparinolyticus was more commonly encountered in purulent lesions (abscesses and pyothoraxes) than in the oral cavity.
TI  - [Influence of the oral administration of indigenous microorganisms on the resistance of mice to Salmonella infection].
AB  - The influence of the oral administration of killed bifidobacteria, lactobacteria, bacteroids and fusobacteria on the anti- Salmonella resistance of mice, infected orally with S. dublin, was studied. Bifidobacteria and lactobacteria were shown to produce a dose-dependent immunostimulating effect. The oral administration of killed bifidobacteria and lactobacteria led to the enhanced resistance of mice to Salmonella infection. The oral administration of killed bifidobacteria was conductive to the normalization of the intestinal microflora in dysbacteriosis developing in cases of Salmonella infection. Bacteroids and fusobacteria were found to possess no such effect.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis endocarditis.
AB  - We recently diagnosed and treated an unusual case of primary endocarditis due to  Bacteroides fragilis, for which no underlying etiology was found. Antibiotic treatment involved multiple parenteral and oral antibiotics, and sensitivity studies allowed choice of antibiotics. Despite complications, the patient was cured. Few cases of Bacteroides fragilis endocarditis have been reported, and therapy has changed with newer antibiotics.
TI  - Cefotaxime i.v. versus oral neomycin-erythromycin for prophylaxis of infections after colorectal operations.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in oral and colonic bacteroides.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in Bacteroides from oral and colonic flora influences the selection of antimicrobial therapy to treat infections involving these organisms. An antimicrobial susceptibility study of 49 clinical isolates of oral bacteroides to 9 drugs revealed high resistance rates for penicillin 53%, for cefaclor 45%, and for tetracycline 27%, while there were low rates (less than 10%) with cefoxitin, piperacillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole. Review of our U.S. nationwide survey of the susceptibility of colonic bacteroides (Bacteroides fragilis group) reveals low resistance to clindamycin, cefoxitin, piperacillin, imipenem, chloramphenicol and metronidazole. However, the identification of clindamycin, clindamycin, cefoxitin, piperacillin, imipenem and chloramphenicol resistant isolates is worrisome. The mechanism of resistance and the resistant transfer mechanism to the different classes of drugs in the oral and colonic bacteroides are reviewed.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Inhibitory and cidal antimicrobial actions of electrically generated silver ions.
AB  - One promising alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of localized infections is the generation of antimicrobial silver ions by the use of low intensity direct current from a pure silver anode implanted at the site of an infection. This study investigates the in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of this system on a variety of organisms.
TI  - Chromosomal DNA probes for the identification of Bacteroides species.
AB  - We compared 22 Bacteroides species by DNA-DNA homology studies using the S1 endonuclease method. None of the currently defined species shared more than 30% DNA homology with any other species examined with the exception of B. buccae and B. capillus (which along with B. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their DNA sequences. Two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with DNA homology greater than 10%. The first cluster included B. coporis, B. disiens, B. bivius, B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus. The second cluster included B. fragilis, B. eggerthii, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis. Five of the oral species, B. asaccharolyticus, B. gingivalis, B. loescheii, B. intermedius and B. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. These were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as Bacteroides species. The DNA probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. DNA probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. In contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as B. intermedius were identified by the DNA probe. The DNA probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of ciprofloxacin in intra-abdominal abscesses caused by Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Experimental intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in mice by intraperitoneal injections of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. The therapeutic efficacy of ciprofloxacin was investigated in this mixed intra-abdominal abscess model and was compared with that of rifampicin. Treatment with ciprofloxacin at 0.2 to 20 mg/kg or rifampicin at 20 mg/kg prevented all mice from death, as compared to the 60% mortality rate observed in the vehicle-treated controls. Rifampicin concentrations at 10 and 20 mg/kg were effective in preventing abscess formation and eradicated bacterial abscess. Ciprofloxacin at all the levels tested neither reduced the incidence of abscess nor eradicated Bact. fragilis from abscesses. However, ciprofloxacin at levels of 20, 10, 5, and 1 mg/kg reduced significantly the number of E. coli cells in the abscess. The peak serum level of ciprofloxacin at the oral dose of 20 mg/kg was 0.43 mg/l which was well above the MIC values for E. coli but not for Bact. fragilis.
TI  - Diffusion of metronidazole through the dentinal tubules of extracted teeth.
AB  - Passing of metronidazole from the root canal of extracted gangrenous teeth through the dentinal tubules was proved by agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assay. The findings explain the excellent clinical experience with metronidazole in root treatment.
TI  - [In vitro study of the diffusion of metronidazole (Klion) in extracted teeth].
AB  
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Oral neomycin and erythromycin compared with single-dose systemic metronidazole and ceftriaxone prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery.
AB  - A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare oral neomycin and erythromycin with single-dose intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone in elective colorectal surgery. The study was discontinued after 60 patients were entered. The overall rate of infection was 41 percent in the oral neomycin and erythromycin group (n = 29) compared with 9.6 percent in those who received intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone (n = 31) (p less than 0.01). Infections in the oral group were principally due to resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli. Preoperative administration of oral neomycin and erythromycin was associated with a significant reduction of Escherichia coli counts (1 X 10(7) to 3 X 10(5) organisms/ml, p less than 0.05) compared with the intravenous group, but there was no significant reduction in the counts of Bacteroides fragilis (2 X 10(8) to 1 X 10(7) organisms/ml) and there was an increase in the counts of Clostridia (2 X 10(4) to 1 X 10(6) organisms/ml). These results indicate that single-dose systemic prophylaxis with appropriate antibiotics is superior to oral neomycin and erythromycin.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  - The distribution of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) and IgA2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the IgA subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In 12 subjects examined, antibodies to Streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen I/II, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans B1355 fraction S and B512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the IgA1 subclass. In contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli were predominantly of the IgA2 subclass. The data indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of IgA.
TI  - Serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  - In the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (SP). Subjects with SP were often seropositive for Eubacterium brachy, Fusobacterium nucleatum E3C22, and Peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (JP) and subjects with healthy periodontium (HP) were not. Both SP and JP subjects were more frequently seropositive for Bacteroides gingivalis, F. nucleatum D52B16, and F. nucleatum E1D1 than were HP subjects. The data were most striking for B. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for SP and JP subject groups. However, SP subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. In contrast, JP and HP subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. Except at very low levels of antibody, neither SP nor JP groups differed significantly from the HP group for antibody to Eubacterium nodatum, Bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or Lactobacillus minutus antibody. There was a high frequency of antibody to E. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite the fact that this organism is rarely found in HP subjects. For Eubacterium timidum, the JP group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the HP group. Despite high levels of L. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 SP subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the HP and JP subjects had detectable antibody. These results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. B. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. However, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., L. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.
TI  - Characteristics of the outer membrane of selected oral Bacteroides species.
AB  - The outer membranes from selected oral Bacteroides species were isolated and characterized morphologically, chemically, and physically. Both sucrose density gradient centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed outer membranes which varied slightly with the species, as well as showing complex polypeptide patterns after SDS--PAGE. The polypeptide distribution revealed a species-specific pattern; however, there was often a variation within a given species in many minor polypeptide bands, with heat-modifiable minor peptides occurring in nearly all species. Protein-associated carbohydrates occurred in several species. Outer membrane fragments (blebs) recovered by ultracentrifugation of the growth supernatants were either nearly identical to the outer membrane polypeptide patterns, or contained reduced amounts of specific polypeptides, again varying with the species. 125I-labelling of whole cells indicated possible surface exposure for several of the major polypeptides.
TI  - Response of a 'susceptible' Escherichia coli to metronidazole therapy: an investigation using experimental subcutaneous abscesses.
AB  - Earlier experiments under anaerobic conditions in vitro had indicated that Gram-negative facultative anaerobes were susceptible to therapeutically attainable concentrations of metronidazole. This prompted us to study the response of one such strain to metronidazole therapy. Mice with 3-day-old subcutaneous abscesses induced by 'susceptible' Escherichia coli (accompanied by potentiating agent and obligately anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis) were given metronidazole by mouth (250 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly) either as a two- or a four-dose course. This therapy reduced the viable numbers of E. coli/abscess by a mere 0.3 log10 and 0.7 log10, respectively. Assays showed that concentrations of metronidazole in abscess-contents compared favourably with those in the earlier in vitro experiments. But measurement of redox potentials in abscesses indicated that the conditions in these (-191 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) were not nearly as reduced as those in experiments in vitro (-650 mV). This, and the known dependence of metronidazole on low redox potentials for expression of its antimicrobial ability, appears to be the explanation for the poor anticoliform effect in the subcutaneous abscess model. Full assessment of the clinical implications of these observations must await the availability of data regarding redox potentials in clinical situations.
TI  - Adhesion of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria to mucosal surfaces.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and black-pigmented Bacteroides species adhere to red blood cells and crevicular epithelium. The attachment of the bacteroides, but not F. nucleatum, is associated with the presence of fimbriae-like structures on the bacterial surface. Such structures have been observed also in unencapsulated Bacteroides fragilis able to adhere to human red cells and cheek epithelium. Encapsulated B. fragilis adheres to porcine brush borders, but the number of adhering cells per brush border fragment is low.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of rifampicin in a Bacteroides fragilis intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  - The efficacy of rifampicin in treating a Bacteroides fragilis infection was investigated and compared to clindamycin and metronidazole in an experimental model of intra-abdominal abscess in mice. Rifampicin, when given subcutaneously, showed activity superior to that of clindamycin in reducing the incidence of abscess formation as well as the number of Bacteroides organisms recovered from the abscess, and rifampicin was comparable in efficacy to metronidazole when given orally at the same dose level. The comparative pharmacokinetic properties of rifampicin and clindamycin demonstrated that the peak serum and abscess levels reached with rifampicin were significantly higher than those of clindamycin. The half-life of rifampicin in serum and in the abscess was longer than that of clindamycin.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis: a possible cause of acute diarrheal disease in newborn lambs.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis with enterotoxin-like activity (BFEL) was isolated from the  feces of 24- to 48-h-old lambs with acute diarrheal disease on three different sheep ranches in the Northern Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The lamb intestinal loop test was used to enrich for the bacterium before its initial isolation. Pure cultures of B. fragilis from the feces of diarrheic lambs caused fluid accumulation in five of five lamb intestinal loop tests and in three of three calf intestinal loop tests. Two different serogroups of BFEL were found in diarrheic lambs, and a third serogroups was found in the feces of a diarrheic ewe. Enteric disease characterized by diarrhea, depression, and inappetence occurred in three of eight newborn, colostrum-fed lambs after oral challenge inoculation with viable BFEL. One of the three lambs died 32 h after challenge. Clinical signs of disease were similar to those observed in the naturally occurring disease. B. fragilis is an obligately anaerobic bacterium found in the intestinal tract of most animals and humans. It is a serious cause of extraintestinal infection in humans. The bacterium has not been reported to cause fluid accumulation in the intestine or to cause diarrhea in any species of animal.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - Anaerobic mediastinitis.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria often are neglected in discussions of the bacteriology of mediastinitis. Two cases of anaerobic mediastinitis are reported and the literature in this field is reviewed. Anaerobes are important pathogens in the etiology of mediastinitis secondary to perforation of the esophagus, extension of a retropharyngeal abscess, or extension of cellulitis or abscess of dental origin from the neck. Although anaerobes indigenous to the oral cavity predominate in these cases, there are also a few cases reported involving Bacteroides fragilis. The source of the mediastinitis should be considered when antimicrobial therapy is initiated so that appropriate anaerobic coverage can be included when indicated.
TI  - Taxonomy of anaerobes: present state of the art.
AB  - Results of nucleic acid studies, which indicate relationships among strains and species more clearly than do usual phenotypic tests, have led to new bacteriologic nomenclature. Some major changes in Bacteroides include the recognition of three species (Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides denticola, and Bacteroides loescheii) formerly grouped in B. melaninogenicus subspecies melaninogenicus; two species (Bacteroides intermedius with two closely related homology groups and Bacteroides corporis) formerly grouped together as B. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius; and two species (Bacteroides buccae and Bacteroides oris) formerly thought to be human isolates of Bacteroides ruminicola subspecies brevis. Former subspecies of Bacteroides fragilis have been elevated to species rank; and Bacteroides uniformis and an unnamed group ("3452A"), recognized. A new genus, Capnocytophaga, with three species, is composed of strains formerly classified as Bacteroides ochraceus or Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group DF-1. Strains previously thought to be human isolates of "Vibrio succinogenes" and related organisms that derive energy by reduction of fumarate or nitrate with formate or hydrogen have been reclassified in Bacteroides (Bacteroides gracilis), Campylobacter (Campylobacter concisus), or in a new genus, Wolinella.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  - The preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. The most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, U-57,930E), in which the (2S-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2S-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. This structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. Although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Plasmodium berghei. Pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. It readily penetrates B. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses. A drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. Urinary excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. Pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in colon surgery.
AB  - One hundred twenty-three patients undergoing elective colon surgery were prospectively and randomly assigned to receive either three 1-g perioperative doses of intramuscular cephaloridine or three 1-g preoperative doses of both oral erythromycin base and neomycin sulfate. All patients had their bowels thoroughly cleansed mechanically. The groups were comparable in age and nutritional status. Eight wound infections occurred in the 65 patients receiving cephaloridine (12.3%) v one in the 58 receiving erythromycin and neomycin (1.7%). The difference was statistically significant. Eight of nine infected patients had only wound infections; the majority of cultures yielded Bacteroides fragilis. Serum and tissue antimicrobial concentrations were determined in the first 70 randomized patients at operation. Mean (+/- SD) cephaloridine levels were 14.7 +/- 10.2 and 10.5 +/- 10.0 mg/L in serum and tissue, respectively, compared with 1.98 +/- 1.58 and 0.699 +/- 1.146 mg/L for serum and tissue erythromycin levels.
TI  - Effect of metronidazole on Escherichia coli in the presence of Bacteroides fragilis: an investigation in mice.
AB  - The observation that, in rats, metronidazole exhibited antimicrobial activity against resistant Escherichia coli (when this was accompanied by susceptible Bacteroides fragilis) prompted us to attempt to reproduce this phenomenon in another species and under other experimental conditions. In experiment 1, mice injected intraperitoneally with an E. coli/B. fragilis mixture were treated with metronidazole, 250 mg/kg given by mouth at 0 and 10 h, or left untreated. At 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in blood and peritoneal washings were determined. In experiment 2, mice with 5-day-old subcutaneous abscesses containing E. coli and B. fragilis were also either given metronidazole as above or left untreated. At 24 h, viable counts of bacteria in pus were determined. Metronidazole affected neither the frequency with which E. coli persisted at the three sites, nor the viability of E. coli at these sites. This was so despite the fact that, in each of the sites, a significant B. fragilis kill was registered. Thus, pending elucidation of the mechanism by which the phenomenon operates, its non-appearance in these experiments cautions against the extrapolation of the original observations beyond the circumstances under which they were first made.
TI  - Septic polyarthritis due to Bacteroides fragilis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. A case report.
AB  - Gram-negative septic arthritis is an uncommon but serious complication of rheumatoid arthritis and is usually mono-articular. The present case is unusual in that a septic polyarthritis due to Bacteroides fragilis developed in nine joints. The organism was grown only in anaerobic synovial fluid and blood cultures. The patient recovered after treatment which included repeated needle aspirations of the joints under anaesthesia and oral metronidazole (Flagyl; Maybaker). Any patient with rheumatoid arthritis who develops an acute flare-up of disease in one or more joints should have these aspirated to exclude the possibility of septic arthritis. Both anaerobic and aerobic cultures of synovial fluid and blood should be done. Prompt antibiotic treatment and joint drainage are the cornerstones of treatment.
TI  - Chloramphenicol: recent developments and clinical indications.
AB  - Recent developments (including more accurate assays) that have led to revised recommendations for route of administration, dosage, and indications for chloramphenicol are reviewed. Chloramphenicol is most bioavailable by the oral route; doses of 75 mg/kg/day provide adequate therapeutic concentrations for most clinical indications. Serum concentrations of the drug should be monitored to ensure adequate therapeutic concentrations and to avoid toxicity. This is particularly important in newborns, in patients with liver dysfunction, and in those receiving concomitant drugs that may influence free chloramphenicol concentrations. The indications for chloramphenicol therapy evaluated are: Haemophilus influenzae infections, anaerobic infections, salmonellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and eye infections. Chloramphenicol is useful in the treatment of invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections resistant to ampicillin, in selected anaerobic and ocular infections, and for rickettsioses in patients under the age of eight years. Because the rare but life-threatening complication of chloramphenicol (aplastic anemia) persists, indications for the drug's clinical use are narrowing once again with the advent of third-generation cephalosporins highly active against gram-negative bacilli including ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. Similarly, metronidazole or clindamycin may be preferred for some anaerobic infections.
TI  - The direct immunofluorescence in the presumptive identification of Bacteroides species.
AB  - Two kits containing fluorescein labeled-polyvalent antisera to Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus (Fluoretec-F) and to Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus and intermedius and to Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (non-oral strains) (Fluoretec-M) were evaluated for the identification of the respective organisms in bacterial cultures and clinical specimens. In both cases immunofluorescent tests were compared to the bacteriological data. The results clearly demonstrated that Fluoretec-F has a specificity 97% and a sensitivity 96%. The corresponding values for Fluoretec-M were 99% and 87.5% respectively, either clinical specimens or pure cultures were examined. The presence of aerobic of facultative anaerobic bacteria and obligate anaerobic bacteria other than those to which antisera were included in the test kits did not seem to influence the test result. No cross-reactivity between Fluoretec-F and -M were observed. Also, no positive fluorescence was obtained when other anaerobic bacteria than Bacteroides spp. were tested. The same was also the case with various aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The use of Fluoretec-F and -M is considered as a useful tool for the early accurate identification of the Bacteroides species mentioned, which may serve as a guide for an appropriate prompt therapy which is especially needed in serious anaerobic infections.
TI  - Collagenolytic activity associated with Bacteroides species and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  - The penetration of metronidazole into synovial fluid.
AB  - Six patients with non-infected synovial effusions, associated either with inflammatory or degenerative arthropathy and requiring diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration, were given a short course of 400 mg metronidazole (Flagyl) 8-hourly for 3 doses. Serum and synovial fluid (SF) were sampled frequently during this time, and assayed for metronidazole by a specific high pressure liquid-chromatographic method. It was found that concentrations of metronidazole in SF reached those in serum after a short time-lag, and thereafter approximated to the serum concentration. With this regimen, metronidazole concentrations were readily achieved in synovial fluid, above the minimum inhibitory concentrations for most susceptible anaerobes. These results indicate that the drug freely enters the synovial fluid and suggests that metronidazole would prove effective in the treatment of septic arthritis due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Effect of linolenyl alcohol on the in-vitro growth of the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using Strep. mutans BHT as the main test organism. Unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. Of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of Strep. mutans BHT, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. All Gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. Gram-negative bacteria did not exhibit the sensitivity. Linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. Repeated exposure of Strep. mutans BHT to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. Significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. Thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.
TI  - Use of fluorescence microscopy for monitoring periodontal disease state.
AB  - Samples of subgingival plaque from patients with periodontal disease and control  subjects were stained with the Fluoretec Fluorescent test kits (Pfizer Inc., New York) developed for the rapid detection of members of the Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups of anaerobes. The same fluorescent fields were also examined by dark-field microscopy for the total count of bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus were found in plaque samples of healthy subjects and periodontally diseased patients with no significant difference in percent of total flora. Oral spirochetes also fluoresced with the antisera used. Samples from healthy sites showed virtually no spirochetes; spirochetes were present in diseased sites. Tests with other antisera also showed that fluorescein-labelled antibodies can be adsorbed nonspecifically to the surface of spirochetes. Such a phenomenon can be used to monitor an individual's periodontal disease state.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in pediatric infections.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria normally outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. They have been isolated from pediatric patients with various diseases. Anaerobic bacteria have been shown to colonize newborns immediately after delivery. These organisms are associated with cellulitis at the site of fetal monitoring, neonatal aspiration pneumonia bacteremia, conjunctivitis and omphalitis. Clostridial spores have been found in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis. Botulism of the newborn has been reported.
TI  - Microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with Streptococcus and Bacteroides.
AB  - Oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (HA) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of HA-active F. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. HA-active sonicated fragments (SF) prepared from F. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. Attachment of F. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the HA activity of the SF in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. HA activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of F. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment. Of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed F. nucleatum HA-active fragments. They included Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, Bacteroides corrodens, Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus sanguis (Blackburn and JC 74) and Streptococcus mutans AHT, BHT, 10449 and 6715. Chelators revealed that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a Ca2+-dependent interaction. Sugar inhibition demonstrated that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a D-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. A reduction in the absorption of F. nucleatum HA-active fragments by Strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.
TI  - Metronidazole treatment of Bacteroides fragilis infections.
AB  - Seven patients with Bacteroides fragilis infections were treated with intravenous and/or oral metronidazole. Infections treated included endocarditis, osteomyelitis, lung abscess, empyema, peritonitis, septicemia, and pelvic infection. Some patients had failed to respond to therapy with chloramphenicol or clindamycin or both. Metronidazole was used alone or in combination with aminoglycosides. Serum levels of metronidazole several times in excess of the minimal inhibitory concentrations for the organisms were easily achieved and in one patient the CSF metronidazole level was equal to that of the serum. Response to therapy with metronidazole was considered to be excellent. The only serious side effect noted was hypotension, which occurred in the last patient. Therapy was discontinued, and therefore therapeutic results could not be evaluated. Metronidazole appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of B fragilis infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Bacteriology and treatment of dental infections.
AB  - The microbiologic and therapeutic aspects of sixty-one cases of pyogenic dental infection were studied through the use of modern anaerobic culture methods. Forty-five (74 percent) patients had anaerobic infections. Among them, eighteen (29.5 percent) had Bacteroides fragilis, of which six were resistant to penicillin at 16 microgram/ml. but all were susceptible to clindamycin at less than 2 microgram/ml. Of twenty-five patients treated with 4 to 20 million units of penicillin per day, twenty were cured and did not suffer relapse. The five patients in whom treatment failed had mandibular fractures infected with B. fragilis. Of ten patients treated with clindamycin (600 mg. intravenously every 6 hours), which included five patients with B. fragilis infections, all were cured. The presence of B. fragilis in dental infections has not been recognized. Dental infections associated with mandibular fracture that fail to respond to conventional penicillin therapy should be routinely cultured for B. fragilis.

TI  - A scheme for the identification of clinical isolates of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli by conventional bacteriological tests.
AB  - More than 1000 strains of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, including reference strains, clinical isolates, and members of the normal flora of the mouth, lower gastro-intestinal tract and vagina of healthy human subjects, were studied by conventional bacteriological methods and by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of metabolic products in a series of investigations. A short combined set of tests with particular discriminant value was selected, and a scheme for the identification of the species and subspecies encountered in the diagnostic bacteriological laboratory was based upon our composite results. The tests are: antibiotic-disk resistance tests with neomycin 1000 micrograms, kanamycin 1000 micrograms, penicillin 2 units and rifampicin 15 micrograms per disk; tolerance tests with sodium taurocholate, Victoria blue 4R and gentian violet; and tests for pigment production, indole production, aesculin hydrolysis and the fermentation of glucose, lactose, sucrose, rhamnose, trehalose, mannitol and xylose. Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli are divided into four groups: (1) the fragilis group with nine species, which include the five subgroups previously classified as subspecies of B. fragilis; (2) the melaninogenicus-oralis group, which includes the three saccharolytic subspecies (ss.) of B. melaninogenicus--ss. melaninogenicus, ss. intermedius and ss. levii--and four non-pigmented species; (3) the asaccharolytic group, which comprises B. asaccharolyticus (formerly B. melaninogenicus ss. asaccharolyticus), B. corrodens and other non-pigmented non-saccharolytic strains, and (4) the fusobacteria.
TI  - Various lipopolysaccharides reduce adhesion of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  - The interaction of LPS from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and lipid A from S. typhimurium with adhesion of human periodontal cells on plastic surfaces has been studied. The results showed that LPS and lipid A reduced adhesion already after 5 min at concentrations from 5 to 200 microgram/ml without influencing cell viability. It could be demonstrated that LPS and lipid A interact with both the cell and the substratum surface. Lipid A from S. typhimurium was more potent than any of the LPS used.
TI  - The isolation and identification of Bacteroides spp. from the normal human gingival flora.
AB  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of subgingival plaque from 20 normal, healthy adults without periodontal disease. a heavy growth of Bacteroides and Fusobacterium spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were selected for identification by conventional bacteriological methods. Results were obtained in these tests with 188 isolates; some strains of the B. melaninogenicus/oralis group would not grow in pure culture on solid media and showed satellitism in mixed culture, and some strains of fusobacteria did not survive repeated subculture. Most isolates (68%) belonged to the B. melaninogenicus/oralis group. The commonest species identified in this group were B. oralis (41%), B. melaninogenicus ss. melaninogenicus (26%) and ss. intermedius (17%). B. oralis was isolated from all subjects and at least one strain of B. melaninogenicus was isolated from 18 out of 20 subjects. Only eight strains of the B. fragilis group were detected and they probably represented transient carriage. Fusobacterium spp. and L. buccalis were isolated from 15 out of 20 subjects and accounted for 21% of the isolates studied, but most could not be identified specifically by the set of tests used. Asaccharolytic species of Bacteroides were isolated in small numbers from seven subjects.
TI  - Clindamycin unresponsive anaerobic osteomyelitis treated with oral metronidazole.
AB  - A diabetic patient with peripheral neuropathy and a foot ulcer developed osteomyelitis of the foot. Antibiotic therapy of the aerobes isolated from the ulcer resulted in no clinical improvement. Intravenous clindamycin therapy of the anaerobe isolated (Bacteroides fragilis) was associated with an incomplete and temporary response, but there was a dramatic response to oral metronidazole with healing of the ulcer and osteomyelitis. One year later there were no signs of recurrence.
TI  - Vein reconstruction of a mycotic internal carotid aneurysm.
AB  - Carotid aneurysms are an extremely rare entity; mycotic carotid aneurysms are even more uncommon. Most articles in the past have advocated ligation as treatment of mycotic carotid aneurysms due to the dangers of graft placement in an infected field. Unfortunately, stroke occurs in many patients so treated. As the cerebral complications were so high, bypass using autogenous vein and fine monofilament polypropylene sutures is attractive. This technique was used in a patient having a mycotic carotid aneurysm who was referred to the Vascular Service of the Shands Teaching Hospital. Pre- and postoperative antibiotics, resection of the aneurysm, anastomosis in a noninfected area, and long-term oral antibiotics were felt to be other important aspects of the patient's treatment. This individual is well one year after operation without neurological sequelae. This case suggests that if strict operative and therapeutic guidelines are observed, bypass with autogenous vein is a feasible operative alternative in patients having mycotic carotid aneurysms. The risk of this procedure must be carefully weighed against the devastating neurological sequellae that might result with ligation.
TI  - Bacteriology of rattlesnake venom and implications for therapy.
AB  - Although the incidence of infection secondary to the bites of venomous snakes remains unknown, the routine use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is advocated. In this study, the venom from 15 rattlesnakes was cultured, and 58 aerobic and 28 anaerobic strains of bacteria were isolated. The most common species isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, coagulase-negative staphylocci, and Clostridium species. Bacteroides fragilis was also recovered. When the fang sheaths of four additional rattlesnakes were retracted and the fangs of these snakes decontaminated, 50% of the samples of venom had no bacterial growth (P = 0.035). Until a clinical study is performed, the use of antimicrobial therapy that reflects that complex oral flora of rattlesnakes is still recommended in most cases of envenomization.

Neither conventional bowel preparation (CBP) using oral magnesium sulphate, enemas and rectal washouts nor whole bowel irrigation (WBI) via a nasogastric tube influenced the type or number of organisms in the colon at the time of operation. The administration of an elemental diet (ED) was associated with only a small reduction the numbers of Escherichia coli (P less than 0.02). The addition of oral neomycin and metronidazole for 48 h before operation to all three methods of bowel preparation was associated with a highly significant reduction in the counts per ml of E. coli (P less than 0.001) and Bacteroides fragilis (P less than 0.001) in the colon. There was no correlation between the diameter of the lesion being resected with the numbers of bacteria in the colon even when oral neomycin and metronidazole were added to the bowel preparation.
TI  - Metronidazole treatment of liver abscess due to bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - A 67-year-old woman with a liver abscess due to Bacteroides fragilis was treated  with metronidazole 0.4 g orally every 8 h for 6 weeks. There was a rapid clinical improvement even though no surgical drainage was performed. By the indirect immunofluorescence technique using the patient's own strain as an antigen the antibody titer declined from 5120 to 80 in 6 months, suggesting eradication of the infecting agent.
TI  - In vitro activity of five oral cephalosporins against anaerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activities of cefaclor and and cefatrizine, two new orally absorbed cephalosporin antibiotics, against 44 isolates of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria were measured using the agar dilution procedure of the World Health Organization-International Collaborative Study. Tests also were performed with cephalexin, cephaloglycin, and cephadrine, as well as with the parenteral cephamycin antibiotic cefoxitin. Cefoxitin was the most active antibiotic and inhibited the majority of isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 4 microgram/ml. None of the oral cephalosporins was clearly superior against all of the anaerobic isolates; only cephadrine and cefatrizine appeared to have any potential clinical value.
TI  - Synergistic action of erythromycin and cefamandole against Bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis.
AB  - Erythromycin and cefamandole have exhibited synergistic activity against eight strains of Bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis. In concentrations of only 0.25 to 0.5 mug of erythromycin per ml (easily obtainable with oral therapy), less than 0.4 mug (0.015 to 1.0) of cefamandole per ml inhibited the B. fragilis strains. In the presence of the erythromycin, the potency of cefamandole was increased more than 100-fold. On the basis of the mechanism of action of these two antibiotics, the synergism may be related to inhibition of beta-lactamase formation by the erythromycin, removal of the bacterial cell wall by the cefamandole permitting erythromycin penetration to the ribosomal level, and decreasing inoculum effect.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of tinidazole. An in vitro comparison of the effects of tinidazole and metronidazole against Bacteroides fragilis and other Anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The new antiprotozoal agent, tinidazole, was found to be bactericidal against all 52 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria tested, 42 Bacteroides fragilis, 4 clostridia and 6 peptostreptococci. The minimum bactericidal concentrations of tinidazole for B. fragilis ranged from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, and those of metronidazole from 0.25 to 8 mug/ml, i.e. several times lower than the serum concentrations achievable after oral administration. In most cases the MIC was identical with MBC or half of it. On the average, tinidazole was slightly more effective against B. fragilis than metronidazole. Although essentially the activities of the two drugs were positively correlated, there was a fourfold difference in their MBC for 10 of the 42 B. fragilis.
TI  - Activity of cephazolin and other cephalosporins against Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The antibiotic sensitivity of 50 strains of Bacteroides fragilis to four cephalosporin compounds, cephazolin, cephaloridine, cephradine and cephalexin is reported. Cephazolin was found to be the most active, 94 per cent of strains being susceptible to blood concentrations achieved on standard dosage, comparative findings with cephaloridine and cephradine were about 50 per cent, and only 22 per cent of strains were inhibited by cephalexin. The importance of infections due to bacteroides is discussed. Although not the treatment of choice, cephazolin, a view of its bacterial activity may be useful alternative for bacteroides infections but clinical trials are needed to confirm the laboratory results.
TI  - Vaginal flora in asymptomatic women.
AB  - Four groups of 25 asymptomatic women--pregnant, premenopausal and taking oral contraceptives, premenopausal and not taking oral contraceptives, and postmenopausal--were studied for the presence in vaginal specimens of aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, fungi, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, herpes simplex virus, mycobacteria, and Trichomonas. No significant differences in microbial flora were found among the groups.
TI  - Clindamycin: an evaluation of its role in dental patients.
AB  - A review of the etiology of orofacial infections, of the pharmacology and spectrum of clindamycin and its associated complications, and a treatment plan for orofacial infections have been presented. On the basis of the data presented, it would seem that except for proved B fragilis infections, clindamycin is not a first-line drug for infections of the orofacial region. There are, however, indications for its use that have been presented. The serious complications associated with its use have also been presented. A high index of suspicion must be maintained regarding the development of these complications if clindaymcin is to be used.
TI  - Bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. Of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. Thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the Enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. Eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. All isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were noninhibitory. The 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
TI  - BACTEROIDES ORALIS, PROPOSED NEW SPECIES ISOLATED FROM THE ORAL CAVITY OF MAN.
AB  - Loesche, W. J. (Forsyth Dental Center and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Mass.), S. S. Socransky, and R. J. Gibbons. Bacteroides oralis, proposed new species isolated from the oral cavity of man. J. Bacteriol. 88:1329-1337. 1964.-Twenty-seven strains of oral bacteroides were characterized and compared with a National Collection of Type Cultures strain of Bacteroides fragilis as well as strains of intestinal bacteroides. A combination of acid end products, gas production, pentose fermentation, and 10% bile tolerance afforded a basis for separation of oral strains from intestinal strains. The oral strains produced succinic, lactic, acetic, and formic acids but no gas. They were inhibited by 10% bile, and did not ferment xylose and arabinose. Intestinal strains consistent with the description for B. fragilis produced succinic, formic, acetic, and propionic acids and gas, with a few strains forming lactic acid. They were stimulated by 10% beef bile, and fermented xylose and arabinose. The oral strains are sufficiently different from intestinal strains of the B. fragilis type, so that they appear to constitute a separate species. It is proposed that they be recognized as B. oralis, sp. n.
