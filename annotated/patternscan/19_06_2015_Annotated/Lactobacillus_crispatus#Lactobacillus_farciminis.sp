TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
