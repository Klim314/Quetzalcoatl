TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Characterization of the genetic locus responsible for the production of ABP-118,  a novel bacteriocin produced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118.
AB  - ABP-118, a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118, a strain isolated from the ileal-caecal region of the human gastrointestinal tract, was purified to homogeneity. Using reverse genetics, a DNA fragment specifying part of ABP-118 was identified on a 10769 bp chromosomal region. Analysis of this region revealed that ABP-118 was a Class IIb two-peptide bacteriocin composed of Abp118alpha, which exhibited the antimicrobial activity, and Abp118beta, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity. The gene conferring strain UCC118 immunity to the action of ABP-118, abpIM, was identified downstream of the abp118beta gene. Located further downstream of abp118beta, several ORFs were identified whose deduced proteins resembled those of proteins involved in bacteriocin regulation and secretion. Heterologous expression of ABP-118 was achieved in Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus cereus. In addition, the abp118 locus encoded an inducing peptide, AbpIP, which was shown to play a role in the regulation of ABP-118 production. This novel bacteriocin is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be isolated from a known human probiotic bacterium and to be characterized at the genetic level.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
AB  - Approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. Only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. Lactobacillus salivarius M7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin B which inhibits the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. A new atypical bacteriocin produced by Lact. acidophilus M46, acidocin B, combines the inhibition of Clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus Lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. Acidocin B is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees C for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. Native acidocin B occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kDa), while with SDS-PAGE the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kDa. Optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin B produced during growth. Growth is not necessary for acidocin B production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. The application potential of acidocin B is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
