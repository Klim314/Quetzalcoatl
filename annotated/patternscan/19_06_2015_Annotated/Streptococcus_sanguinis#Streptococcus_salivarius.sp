TI  == novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. antimicrobial peptides (amps) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. hence, it is  difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter amp that was still active against p. gingivalis. a  peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (arg, his and lys), two anionic amino acids (glu and asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (leu, ile, val, ala and pro) and hydrophilic residues (ser and gly) was obtained and named pep-7. its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. the mechanism of  action of pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. the  pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. gingivalis atcc 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 1.7 microm, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (p. intermedia, tannerella  forsythensis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguinis). from transmission electron microscopy studies, pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis. a concentration of pep-7 at  four times that of its mbc induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. the pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees c) and possessed activity over a ph range of 6.8-8.5. it was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 mum and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pep-7 showed selective activity against porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of p. gingivalis. the pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. this work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic pep-7 against p. gingivalis.

TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  == background and objectives: recently, use of herbal medicine and plant extracts as a substitute for commercially available chemical drugs for control of infectious  diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease has become increasingly popular. the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. materials and methods: for primary assessment of the antibacterial properties of rhus coriaria l. water extract, the well-plate method in bhia (brain heart infusion agar, merck, germany) medium was used using macrodilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the extract against each microorganism were determined. the effect of rhus coriaria l. on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire was assessed using viable cell count in biofilm medium (bm) containing 3% sucrose. in the final phase, after fixation of samples in alcohol and glutaraldehyde, samples were prepared for sem (scanning electron microscopy)  analysis. results: the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition was proportionate to the tested concentrations of the extract. the lowest mic (0.390  mg/ml) and mbc (1.5 mg/ml ) of the rhus coriaria l. were found to be against streptococcus sobrinus atcc 27607. rhus coriaria l. water extract decreased bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire at mic and 1/8 of mic by s. sanguinis atcc 10556, s. sobrinus atcc 27607, s. salivarius atcc 9222, s. mutans  atcc 35608 and e. faecalis cip 55142 by24.2%-43%, 68.5%-91.6%, 10.6%-79.1%, 22.2%-86.1% and 40.6%-76.4%, respectively. conclusion: based on the results, rhus coriaria l. water extract had significant antibacterial properties against five common oral bacteria and was able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. further investigations are recommended for widespread clinical  use of this extract.

TI  == antifouling coatings for dental implants: polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  == titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. the aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (peg-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a peg-like coating. streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. thus, the peg-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce  the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.

TI  == species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == antibacterial properties of hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  == dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. in order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been studied. to covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hlf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. smooth titanium samples were coated with hlf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (aptes), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. peptide presence was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. the ldh assays confirmed that hffs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. the in vitro antibacterial properties of the  modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (streptococcus sanguinis and  lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. a higher decrease in  bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by atrp methods compared to silanization. this effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer pdma segment.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == silver deposition on titanium surface by electrochemical anodizing process reduces bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. material and methods: titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. physicochemical properties were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. the in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. nonparametric statistical kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. post hoc spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. results: x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. no negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected  and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. conclusions: silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.

TI  == the influence of oral veillonella species on biofilms formed by streptococcus species.
AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == covalent immobilization of hlf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. a common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. however, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. a promising alternative is the  use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hlf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. to this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hlf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hlf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. an outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. furthermore, samples coated with the hlf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == the efficacy of neem extract on four microorganisms responsible for causing dental caries viz streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis: an in vitro study.
AB  == history and objectives: from the ancient time, neem used to be the traditional medicine for many diseases and was mainly used for cleaning the oral cavity. the  incidence of dental caries was less a few decades ago but now the incidence of caries is very aggressive. this might be due to change in dietary habits, life style and more tendency toward processed food. the objective of this study is to  find out the truth that if the neem is really efficacious against caries-inducing microorganisms, mainly streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis. materials and methods: the dried neem sticks ground into a coarse powder and weighed into 5, 10 and 50 gm were added to 100 ml of deionized double distilled water. after soaking for 2 days, the water was filtered at 4 degrees c and the fine filtrate was inoculated onto blood agar plates contains individual species of microorganisms and incubated at  37 degrees c for 2 days. results: at maximum concentrations, neem extract has shown the maximum zone of inhibition on streptococcus mutans. at less concentration, the efficacy of neem has shown some inhibition of growth for all the four species of microorganisms. conclusion: neem chewing provides the maximum benefits. hence, the use of chewing sticks of neem can be recommended.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  == the peptide lys-[trp(6)]-hy-a1 (lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  hy-a1, initially isolated from the frog species hypsiboas albopunctatus. according to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 (kifgaiwplalgalknlik-nh2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. the methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. the microorganisms streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c under atmospheric pressure with 10% co2. the peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug ml(-1)). chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and bhi culture medium was used as the negative control. the tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. thus, the peptide lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.

TI  == enantiomeric hplc resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  == a new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3h)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and lda to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. the cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. the reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with dibal in thf, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. the enantiomeric  fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective hplc. the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ecd) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. an all-trans relative configuration was determined by nmr on the bases of (1)h coupling constants and nuclear overhauser  effect (n.o.e.) experiments. the absolute configuration at c1 was assigned on the basis of the ecd sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ecd spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. the assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ecd couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions l(b) and b(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. the best results obtained for the (1r,2s,3s) isomer were against streptococcus mutans (250 mum), streptococcus salivarius (250 mum), streptococcus sobrinus (280 mum) and streptococcus mitis (280 mum). the (1s,2r,3r) isomer was active only against streptococcus sanguinis (280 mum). the enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1r,2s,3s) isomer.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) discs.
AB  == purpose: bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (osseotite(r)) and an osseotite surface with nanometer-scale discrete crystalline deposition (dcd) of calcium phosphate (cap)(nanotite(r)). methods: surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. bacterial adhesion on machined, osseotite(r), and nanotite(r) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: streptococcus mutans ccug 35176, streptococcus sanguis ccug 17826, streptococcus salivarius ccug 11878, actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans ccug 37002, porphyromonas gingivalis ccug 2521. the assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: total viable count (tvc) estimation and confocal laser scanning microscopic (cslm) studies. results: the surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<nanotite(r)<osseotite(r). the attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on osseotite(r) and even higher on nanotite(r) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). the reduction  in bacterial attachment was more significant on osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) for  a. actinomycetecomitans, s. mutans and s. sanguis than for p. gingivalis and s. salivarius strains. conclusions: nanotite(r) samples showed the lowest amount of  bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher osseotite(r) surfaces.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial comparison of chlorhexidine, persica mouthwash and miswak  extract.
AB  == aim: herbal mouthwashes, such as persica (salvadora persica, mint and yarrow extracts) and miswak extract have been shown to decrease gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of persica and miswak extract with the conventional mouthwash chlorhexidine against streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus vulgaris and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, blood-agar culture (merk, germany) was used to grow the streptococcus strains, saburd-dextrose culture (merk, germany) was used to grow c. albicans and mrs-agar was used to grow l. vulgaris. various concentrations of  these substances (0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of miswak extract, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125% of persica, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of chlorhexidine) were added to paper disks, separately, inserted into culture plates and transferred into the incubator. the inhibition zone around each disk was measured after 24 hours and the data was analyzed by the kruskal-wallis test. results: chlorhexidine possessed antibacterial activity at all concentrations tested. it was more effective than persica and miswak at all concentrations on s. salivarius (p = 0.022 for 0.1%, 0.009 for 0.05 and 0.025%). it had greater effect than the other  two tested material on s.sanguis only at concentration 0.01%. chlorhexidine was the most effective against s.salivarius; persica was the most effective against lactobacillus (p = 0.005) and the least effective against s. salivarius; and miswak extract was the most effective against s. salivarius and s. sanguis at concentrations 0.1 and 0.05% (p = 0.005) and ineffective against l. vulgaris. none of these mouthwashes were effective against c. albicans. conclusion: this study revealed that chlorhexidine remains the gold standard as an antimicrobial agent, although herbal based mouthwashes do have marginal antimicrobial activities. it is necessary to conduct more clinical and microbiological studies  focusing on periodontal pathogens and anaerobic microorganisms. clinical significance: mechanical plaque control is the main way for periodontal disease prevention and mouthrinses are used to improve its efficacy. based on the results of this study, chlorhexidine has the most antibacterial effect and although persica mouthwash and miswak are routinely used in some asian countries their antibacterial efficacies are suspected.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  == purpose: this study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. materials and methods: two strains of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. the adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c for 3 months. ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees c artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. results: the bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. after 1  month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. after 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the  flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. conclusions: these results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro,  bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. it is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may  produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == [can dental problems have influence on difficulties in treating paranasal sinusitis in children?].
AB  == paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a general practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. in most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. however, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. it is most often  connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and  oroantral fistula inflammation. inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. in microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in children's otolaryngology, audiology and phoniatrics clinic in lodz. there seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. it is so essential on account of the gravity of  the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

(rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  == alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. recently, malolactic fermentation (mlf) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of mlf of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. l-malic acid was rapidly fermented to l-lactic acid and co(2) by induced cells of wild-type s. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mles (malolactic enzyme) or  mlep (malate permease). mutants for mler (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for mlf. loss of capacity to catalyze mlf resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. mlf was also found  to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. the capacity of s. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low ph values of 4 or 5. mlf acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of streptococcus salivarius. malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == novel analysis of bacterium-substratum bond maturation measured using a quartz crystal microbalance.
AB  == studies in flow displacement systems have shown that the reversibility of bacterial adhesion decreases within seconds to minutes after initial contact of a bacterium with a substratum surface. atomic force microscopy (afm) has confirmed  that the forces mediating bacterial adhesion increase over a similar time span. the interfacial rearrangements between adhering bacteria and substratum surfaces  responsible for this bond maturation have never been studied. quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (qcm-d) senses the interfacial region in real time  and nondisruptively up to 250 nm from the sensor surface. in this paper, qcm-d is combined with real-time observation of bacterial adhesion in a flow displacement  system, in order to analyze resident-time-dependent changes in dissipation. three different streptococcus salivarius strains showed a nonlinear relation between total dissipation shift (deltad) and number of adhering bacteria, whereas inert and rigid silica particles demonstrated a linear relation between deltad and the  number of adhering particles. this suggests removal of interfacial water due to residence time dependent deformation of the nonrigid bacterium-substratum interface during bond maturation. dissipation could be described by an exponentially decaying function, which combined with adhesion data allowed extraction of the dissipation shifts per bacterium upon initial contact (deltad(0)), after bond maturation (deltad(infinity)), as well as a characteristic time constant (tau(bm)). all bacterial strains showed significant  bond maturation within one minute after their arrival at the substratum surface,  which was not observed for silica particles. dissipation analysis at the level of individually adhering bacteria would have been impossible without the simultaneous real-time analysis of bacterial adhesion numbers.

AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == pcr detection of bacterial genes provides evidence of death by drowning.
AB  == we have developed a sensitive and specific pcr method for detecting plankton dna  in cases of death by drowning. however, this pcr method could not be used for cases of drowning in water containing no plankton. bacteria species are normally  localized in the throat and trachea and they may invade into blood through the respiratory tract in people who have drowned as well as species localized in water. the aim of this study was to establish a novel and expedient pcr method for detecting bacterial genes in samples from drowning cases. we designed primer  pairs for streptococcus salivarius (sl1) and streptococcus sanguinis (sn1), which are common species in the throat, and for aeromonas hydrophila (ah1), which has been found in various water samples. with sl1, sn1, and ah1, we detected 10, 0.1, and 1 pg of target dna, respectively. among 19 drowned cases within 3 days postmortem, sl-dna was detected in all of the blood samples from hearts with sl1  and ah-dna was detected in several samples with ah1. in a case of drowning in a bathtub, use of the conventional acid digestion method for diatom analyses and the pcr method for identifying plankton dna revealed no plankton, but our pcr method for detecting bacterial dna showed a positive result for sl-dna in a blood sample from the heart. in conclusion, our novel pcr method is highly specific and sensitive for detecting bacterial dna and is useful for cases of death by drowning in water containing no plankton.

AB  == introduction: it has been documented that total removal of carious dentin, assessed according to clinical criteria, does not mean complete eradication of bacteria. for that reason in prevention of caries and pulp inflammations, application of the materials having high antibacterial properties seems to be indispensable. aim: determination of antibacterial activities of two white mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) preparations against bacteria of the genus streptococcus. material and methods: antibacterial activities of the materials were determined by diffusion method on a solid tryptic-soy medium (tryptic soy agar, oxoid). wells were prepared on the medium with a puncher of 7 mm diameter and 5 mm depth (four for each material). the bottom was poured with 10 microlitres of liquid tsa for sealing. bacterial suspension was inoculated with cotton swabs onto the medium surface and then the wells were filled with the materials prepared ex tempore. the plates were left in room temperature for 30 minutes and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. results were read by measuring the inhibition zones on day 1, 2, 3 and 8 of the culture. results: all the study  samples demonstrated inhibition of bacteria of the genus streptococcus. the antibacterial effect of mta was maintained till the end of the experiment (day 8). proroot white showed slightly larger inhibition zone against streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis as compared to mta white angelus. the mean inhibition zones against streptococcus mutans appeared the same for both test materials. conclusion: the two mta preparations assessed in the current study show good antibacterial action against the standard strains streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. this study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. methods: the colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled a. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal  laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. culture and quantitative polymerase  chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a modified robbins device. results: colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis). the most inhibiting species was s. sanguinis. conclusion: these results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == fluoride release and antibacterial activity of selected dental materials.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the fluoride ion release and antibacterial activities of the glassionomer cement fuji ix and the compomer (composite modified polyacid) dyract ap. fluoride ion release was measured using direct potentiometry with an orion fluoride ion selective electrode. the measurement was carried out after 1, 4, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of storage in phosphate buffer at  ph 6.8. the antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated against the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 35668, streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556, and lactobacillus casei subsp. casei atcc 393.  the agar diffusion test was applied. the material specimens were assessed twice:  after setting and seven days later. zones of bacterial growth inhibition were measured in millimeters after 24 hours. the results of the study showed that both materials released ion fluoride, with a higher emission of fuji ix than dyract ap. the highest level of emission was observed on the seventh day of the study in both materials. after 24 hours of bonding there was inhibition of bacterial growth by fuji ix, whereas dyract ap did not show similar activity. on the eighth day after polymerization, dyract ap was significantly more active towards streptococcus sanguis and salivarius.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

(2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis may react with lancefield group f antiserum.
AB  == lancefield group f streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by streptococcus sinensis (type strain hku4t, hku5 and hku6). all three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. gene sequencing showed no base differences between the  16s rrna gene sequences of hku5 and hku6 and that of hku4t. all three strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. all grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h  incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. lancefield grouping revealed that hku5 and hku6 were lancefield group f, but hku4t was non-groupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f or g antisera. hku4t was identified by the vitek system (gpi), api system (20 strep) and atb system (id32 strep) as 99 % streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % s. intermedius and 99.9 % streptococcus anginosus, respectively. using the same tests, hku5 was identified as 87 % streptococcus sanguinis/streptococcus gordonii, 59 % streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % s. anginosus, respectively, and hku6 as 87 % s. sanguinis/s. gordonii, 77 % streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % s. anginosus, respectively. the present data  revealed that a proportion of lancefield group f streptococci could be s. sinensis. lancefield group f streptococci should not be automatically reported as 's. milleri'.

TI  == low ph-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == zymographic characterization of bacteriolytic enzymes produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% sds extracts of oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius. we investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for s. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). on the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. two major bacteriolytic enzymes of s. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kda were  found using sds-boiled s. mutans or s. sobrinus cells as substrate. these bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing s. mitis or s.  salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing s. sanguis. s. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kda) as strong activity using s. sobrinus cells as substrate. s. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. extracts of either s. mitis or s. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

TI  == the bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in kuwait.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

AB  == aims: the purpose of the present study was to examine whether sublethal concentrations of helichrysum italicum extract could affect some of the cariogenic properties of streptococcus mutans. methods and results: we studied the antibacterial activity of h. italicum (ethanolic extract) against oral streptococci (strep. mutans atcc 35668, strep. salivarius atcc 13419 and strep. sanguis atcc 10556) and its influence on cell-surface hydrophobicity, in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to glass surface and cellular aggregation of strep. mutans. the results indicate that all streptococci were susceptible to ethanolic  extract with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 31.25-62.50 microg  x ml(-1). sub-mic concentrations of h. italicum (7.81-31.25 microg x ml(-1)) reduced the hydrophobicity and the adherence (almost 90%) to glass surface of strep. mutans. the aggregation in the presence of dextran t2000 was also affected. conclusion: the inhibitory activity of h. italicum extract on strep. mutans is worthy of further study. significance and impact of the study: there is considerable interest in the use of natural compounds as alternative methods to control undesirable micro-organisms.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == a ph-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (bcecf), was used to determine intracellular ph (ph(in)). the efflux of bcecf loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees c for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. in the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular bcecf in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for ph(in) determination. in the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. thus, the ph(in) of s. mutans cells was measured by the bcecf method in the absence of glucose at various acidic ph levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. the ph(in) was almost equal to the extracellular ph (ph(out)) for ph(out) values  of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the s. mutans cell membrane. for ph(out) between 5 and 4, ph(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. ph(in) decreased at ph(out) values of <  4. the constant ph(in) at acidic ph(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == alteration of the coadherence of candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  == interactions between bacterial oral flora and candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. this study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of c. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine  triphosphate (atp) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. when yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (ynb) supplemented with 250 mm glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of streptoccus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus and actinomyces. however, when the yeast was precultured in ynb supplemented with 500 mm galactose, the yeast coadhered with s. salivarius and actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in ynb with glucose. in addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of s. sanguis was significantly reduced. enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == adaptation of oral streptococci to low ph.
AB  == the strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. all of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. as a result, the ph value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. at this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its f-atpase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping  protons out of the cells. s. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and s. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. the picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by gram-negative bacteria. what remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low ph and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. in this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until ph values return to a more favorable level.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == membrane locus and ph sensitivity of paraben inhibition of alkali production by oral streptococci.
AB  == parabens were found to be potent inhibitors of alkali production from arginine by oral streptococci such as streptococcus rattus, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii. for example, 2 mumol butylparaben per ml completely and irreversibly inhibited arginolysis by intact cells of s. rattus fa-1 and was lethal for the organism. in contrast, butylparaben was not a very effective inhibitor of ureolysis by intact cells of streptococcus salivarius 57.i, although it did kill the cells. butylparaben irreversibly inhibited the cytoplasmic enzymes arginine deiminase, carbamate kinase and urease in permeabilized cells or isolated form. however, inhibition of arginolysis by intact cells appeared to be  due primarily to irreversible inhibition of transport systems for arginine uptake, because butylparaben added to intact cells did not reduce levels of arginine deiminase when the cells were subsequently permeabilized after washing.  the insensitivity of ureolysis by intact cells to butylparaben can be related to  the known high permeability of cell membranes to urea and the cytoplasmic location of urease. the potency of butylparaben as an inhibitior of arginolysis or glycolysis and as a lethal agent was found to be greater at acid ph that at neutral or alkaline ph.

AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == effect of oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds on dental caries by in  vitro experiment and rat-caries model.
AB  == earlier work in vitro showed that oleanolic acid (oa) was a potential inhibitor of insoluble glucan (isg) synthesis from mutans streptococci (ms). in this study, two oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds (oa-cds), oleanolic acid-g1-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-g1-beta cd) and oleanolic acid-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-beta cd), were assayed for their effects on isg synthesis from streptococcus  mutans mt8148r, and on the growth of oral bacteria. oa-beta cd inhibited isg synthesis by 55.3 and 37.4% at 62.5 and 15.6 micrograms/ml of oa, respectively. both oa-cds inhibited the growth of ms, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius at 4 to 8 micrograms/ml of oa. the anticariogenic effect of the oa-beta cd was examined in  a rat-caries model. rats in the infected control groups showed the highest caries score. the infected treatment group b (0.5% oa in diet) showed lower scores than  the control group. these results suggest that oa-beta cd is a potential anti-caries agent.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

AB  == to determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (str. pyogenes t12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), we measured  serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of streptococcus (str.) sanguis, str. salivarius, str. mitis or str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the serum igg antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, str. sanguis and str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with ppp (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt: n = 25) and in healthy  adults (n = 17). serum antibody igg level to str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. the iga antibody levels against any streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. the igm antibody levels to str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with rt than in patients with ppp. in western blot analysis, the serum igg antibodies against 25-27 kda protein from whole cell body of str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with ppp than in healthy adults. however, the western blot profile in str. pyogenes was not different between ppp and healthy adults. no significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of igm or igm antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. these data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related ppp and the 25-27 kda protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic  abnormality.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. an evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

AB  == using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. the reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of streptococcus salivarius krf2, s. sanguis krf3, and actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. the results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva  and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva  have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

TI  == [serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  == background: infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. streptococcus is still  the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. patients and methods: we investigated the presence of antibody (ab), total and igm by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (sie), streptococcal bacteraemia (sb), staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with sie and sb inverted question markhomologous ab inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of streptococcus: streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus sanguis ii, nutritional dependent streptococci and enterococcus faecalis (heterologous ab). results: homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with sie and only in 2 with sb (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). igm titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with sie (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). the  fall of the ab titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

AB  == objectives: the ability of three oral bacteria to adhere to hydrophobic amalgam (water contact angle 60 degrees) and hydrophobic resin composites (prisma-ap.h 56 degrees. herculite xrv 82 degrees and z100 89 degrees) was compared using an in vitro assay. methods and results: following preincubation of the materials with human saliva, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the surfaces to adsorb carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds in a conditioning film that appeared to  block the detection of na and others in 2100 resin. hg and ag in amalgam, si and  zn in prisma ap.h resin and ag and na in herculite resin. the precoating of the substrata by a proteinaceous conditioning film led to decreased binding of viable cells of streptococcus sanguis ch3, streptococcus salivarius hb and actinomyces viscosus wg as compared with the adhesion to bare composites. with and without salivary coating, there was a correlation between increased bacterial hydrophobicity and increased retention on the substrata. however, there was no statistical difference in binding to the amalgam compared with the resin composites. in vitro studies showed that the bacteria autoaggregated in the presence of saliva. conclusion: the results indicate the potential ability of normal oral flora to colonize resin composite.

AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

TI  == bactericidal action of tachyplesin i against oral streptococci.
AB  == tachyplesin i, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. the present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 streptococcus sanguis, 3 streptococcus mutans, 9 streptococcus  salivarius and 3 streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin i, whereas 9 s. sanguis strains were resistant. interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both kawasaki disease and behcet patients. according to the time-kill study, tachyplesin i inhibited irreversibly  the growth of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains within 20 min and an s. milleri strain within 80 min. although it has been suggested that escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin i, the present results show that only 3 s. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin i in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin i in saline than these were in a rich medium.

AB  == the grouping and identification made by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic  positions. grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. the oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. this division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. in  the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for streptococcus crista, strep. salivarius and strep. rattus. a few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. it is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that ft-ir might develop into a new identification method  for oral streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  == the ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus crista and tufted streptococcus sanguis ii strains. lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with s. gordonii and s. sanguis. the coaggregation between l. salivarius and s. salivarius, s. gordonii or tufted s. sanguis ii strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. the coaggregation between l. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

TI  == oral streptococcal colonization of infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and proportions of different streptococcal species among the streptococcal flora during infancy. a total of 60 oral samples were collected by oral swabbing of the buccal mucosa and alveolar ridges of 18 infants before tooth eruption and from buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth after tooth eruption. a total of 549 isolates on mitis salivarius agar were speciated, principally by recently revised biochemical criteria of kilian et al. streptococcus mitis biovar 1 predominated, both in prevalence (89%) and proportion of oral streptococci recovered in each sample (median = 87% of streptococcal flora). streptococcus salivarius was also prevalent (94%) but generally represented a small percentage of the total streptococcal flora (median = 3%). streptococcus oralis and streptococcus anginosus strains were detected in approximately one third of predentate and dentate infants in the first year of life. streptococcus sanguis strains were not detected before tooth eruption, but could be detected in 7/14 of the infants with teeth. thus, s. mitis constitutes the major component of the initially colonizing streptococcal microbiota of the young infant.

TI  == ph changes in human dental plaque from lactose and milk before and after adaptation.
AB  == ph changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) ph was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. the ph decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque ph from lactose as from glucose. (2) similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced ph decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque ph in 7 subjects. all solutions resulted in ph falls. the most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque ph wire telemetry. lactose and milk were fermented more  slowly than sucrose. in a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. the results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.

TI  == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == this is a review of 203 episodes of alpha-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia during a 12-year period (1980-91) in a large community teaching hospital in the usa. there were 87 male and 116 female patients, with ages ranging from newborn infants to a 96-year-old; 118 patients (58.1%) were 60 years or older. 31 patients had endocarditis, 93 had bacteremia, and 79 had polymicrobial bacteremia. streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius accounted for 80% of the strains. some strains were resistant to tetracycline, nafcillin, erythromycin or clindamycin. the overall mortality was 29.6% (60 of 203 patients). there was no significant difference in the mortality among patients with endocarditis, bacteremia, and polymicrobial bacteremia. factors that adversely influenced the mortality rate were old age (60 years and older) and rapidly fatal or ultimately fatal underlying conditions.

AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

AB  == the initial surface retention of streptococcus sanguis (g9b and atcc 10556) and streptococcus salivarius (atcc 9758 and atcc 13419) was examined using a well defined flow cell system. the microorganisms, known to be recovered from hard vs. soft tissue surfaces, respectively, were suspended in either ringer solution, human parotid saliva (hps), human submandibular and sublingual saliva (hsmsl), or mixed saliva. microbial retention was evaluated on germanium prisms of low (20-25 mnm-1) and medium (30-35 mnm-1) critical surface tensions following distilled water rinse at 1 ml/min for 15 min. when suspended in only ringer solution, the tested microorganisms showed patterns of generally high retention, that reflected the influence of both bacterial and substratum surface properties. however, in the saliva suspensions an overall reduction of retention was found with preferential retention to surfaces of medium critical surface tension for all bacteria. when comparing hps and hsmsl as the suspending medium, a statistically  significant observation was that smaller numbers of retained bacteria were recorded in the presence of hsmsl. the most frequently observed relationship between the tested salivas and numbers of retained cells was hsmsl less than mixed less than hps.

AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the etiology of behcet's syndrome (bs) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal  species have been implicated. a hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen,  such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kda heat shock protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kda band with all six streptococcus sanguis strains examined and s. pyogenes but not with s. salivarius. by applying  a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kda antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis st3 and h.83 and one with a different mr was identified in kth-1 and s. pyogenes. monoclonal antibodies y1.2, c1.1, ii h9, and ml30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and  276 to 297 of the 65-kda heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these  residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis and s. pyogenes. immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with bs for immunoglobulin a  (iga) and igg antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kda with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, s. sanguis strains, and s. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. a 65- to 70-kda band was found more frequently with s. sanguis kth-2 or kth-3 and iga in serum from patients with bs than with serum from controls (p less than 0.02). antibodies in  serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with bs this revealed significantly raised iga antibodies to the recombinant 65-kda mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of s. sanguis st3, kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3. whereas significant anti-65-kda heat shock protein  and anti-s. sanguis st3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-s. sanguis kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3 antibodies were confined to bs. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat  shock proteins from streptococci.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == a total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. more than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. streptococcus sanguis, strep. oralis,  strep. gordonii, strep. salivarius and strep. pyogenes. isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. when evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque  ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. the findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant oral streptococci in dental patients susceptible to infective endocarditis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of amoxycillin and erythromycin resistance in oral streptococci in patients at risk from infective endocarditis. samples of gingival crevicular flora were taken from 65 patients at the site of dental treatment, prior to the prophylactic administration of amoxycillin (54 patients) or erythromycin (11 patients). samples were also taken  from 65 dental patients who were not considered to be at risk from infective endocarditis. no isolate had a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of amoxycillin greater than 24 mg/l. however, erythromycin-resistant oral streptococci with mic values greater than 3.5 mg/l were isolated from 22% of patients receiving amoxycillin prophylaxis, 9% of patients receiving amoxycillin  prophylaxis, 9% of patients given erythromycin prophylaxis and 9% of patients not at risk from infective endocarditis. the antibiotic-resistant streptococci comprised mainly streptococcus sanguis biotype ii, although s. sanguis biotype i, s. mitis and s. salivarius were also frequently recovered.

TI  == on salivary film formation and bacterial retention to solids. a methodological and experimental in vitro study.
AB  == a parallel-plate flow cell system was developed to assess individual and combined parameters relevant to oral microbial retention. in this system, internal reflection germanium prisms represented oral solid surfaces including tooth surfaces. the system used, allowed adsorbed protein films to be analyzed in situ  by multiple non-destructive surface analytical techniques, without provoking surface associated biofilms. using a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques, germanium prisms of medium critical surface tension were noted to accurately model film formation at tooth-saliva interfaces. a range of clinically relevant temperatures (22 and 37 degrees c), rinse shear rates (1 and 32 ml/min)  and critical surface tensions (high, medium and low) were systematically tested in the flow-cell system for their influence, if any, on salivary microbial retention from whole human saliva. comparisons of the interfacial organization of adsorbed material were made between human parotid (hps) and submandibular-sublingual (hsmsl) salivas. the influence of these salivary secretions was also tested on the retention capacities of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius. microbial retention was found to be significantly dependent on initial critical surface tensions and rinse flow rates, but not to be affected by tested temperatures. when compared to prisms of low and high critical surface tension, medium critical surface tension prisms retained the highest numbers of microorganisms. no statistically verified morphological selectivity was observed in the retained microbial populations. when the interfacial organizations of hps and hsmsl were evaluated at low- and medium energy surfaces in the absence and presence the streptococci, comparatively thinner and denser films with pronounced bacterial retention was noted for hps on prisms of low critical surface tension. in the presence of saliva or salivary fractions, no difference in retention capacities was observed between the tested  bacterial strains. the data suggest that in the presence of saliva, physico-chemical and mechanical factors have a major influence on the short term  microbial retention to solid surfaces. the amount of salivary proteins being initially retained to a material also seems to be more directly related to the critical surface tension quality of the solid than to the type of bacterial strain present in suspension. the empirical critical surface tension of a material is thus a useful predictor of both microbial retention capacities and primary interactions between saliva and solid surfaces.

TI  == the influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

AB  == physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the api-20strep system and a selection of conventional tests. cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of colman and williams. the organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--streptococcus mutans, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and s. milleri. analysis confirmed that s. mitior and s. sanguis can be distinguished in the api-20strep test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production.  although s. mutans, s. mitior and s. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. with this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. api-20strep is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

TI  == cariogenicity of a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant of streptococcus mutans serotype c in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. compared with the wild-type ldh-positive (ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of sprague-dawley rats. the ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041,  although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (p greater than or equal to 0.2) less. multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from ldh- to ldh+ in vivo. both ldh+ strain 041 and ldh- strain 044 demonstrated  bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (s. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (s. mutans). serotypes b (s. rattus) and f (s. mutans) and strains of s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were not inhibited. thus, ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. these traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other  cariogenic s. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.

TI  == aspects of dental plaque formation with special reference to colloid-chemical phenomena.
AB  == in order to investigate factors of importance for plaque formation and the rate of plaque formation 133 randomly selected individuals went through a 3-day period of plaque accumulation. from these individuals one group of "heavy" and one group of "light" plaque formers were selected for further studies. these subjects were  investigated with reference to clinical, biochemical, biophysical and microbiological variables, that in the literature have been suggested to influence plaque formation. the collected data were analysed statistically both by comparisons between the two groups and by multiple regression. in the comparative analyses there were only minor differences between the groups, and no single studied variable was considered as the only explanation to the great difference in the amount of plaque formed after 3 days between "heavy" and "light" plaque formers. the multiple regression showed that the initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces was dependent on the clinical wettability of tooth surfaces, the saliva-induced aggregation of oral bacteria and finally the relative salivary flow conditions around the tooth surfaces where the bacterial samples were collected. on basis of these results, it was suggested that saliva and oral bacteria could at least partly be looked upon as being a biological colloid system system. further studies were designed to investigate whether oral  bacteria could be regarded as colloid particles or not, and to study the properties of saliva as a colloid suspending medium. these studies showed that bacteria suspended in different salt solutions were dependent on ph, ionic concentration and the valency of the cations in the solutions to be able to aggregate. the aggregating capacity further seemed to be specific for different bacterial species and strains. addition of saliva from "heavy" and "light" plaque formers influenced the colloid stability of bacteria suspended in water in different ways. saliva from "light" plaque formers gave a lower colloid stability in suspensions of a plaque-forming bacterium (streptococcus sanguis) as compared  to the addition of saliva from "heavy" plaque formers. no such differences were observed in suspensions of s. salivarius, which is normally not a plaque-forming  bacterium. the results indicate that colloid-chemical processes might be involved in bacterial attachment to tooth surfaces, and that initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces at least partly follow general biophysical laws.

TI  == effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == influence of saliva from 'heavy' and 'light' plaque formers on the colloidal stability of bacterial suspensions.
AB  == the influence of parotid saliva on the colloid stability of suspensions of streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius was studied in groups of previously identified 'heavy' and 'light' plaque formers. for s. sanguis it was observed that addition of parotid saliva from light plaque formers had more pronounced negative influence on the colloid stability than addition of such saliva from heavy plaque formers. no differences were observed for s. salivarius. the results indicate that saliva and bacteria might be regarded as a biological colloidal system and that the individual rate of plaque formation can perhaps be partially  related to the colloid-chemical properties of bacteria and saliva.

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody to oral streptococcal antigens in children.
AB  == antibodies to s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mutans cells and to glucosyltransferases (gtf) prepared from these micro-organisms were measured in the sera of 133 infants and children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). igg antibody activity to each cell type and gtp was present at birth (presumably derived from maternal transfer) and declined significantly thereafter. igg antibody levels to s. salivarius and s. sanguis were next detected in young children (2 to less than 3 yr group). however, an increase in igg antibody to s. mutans cells was not seen until children were older (4 to less than 8 yr group), possibly reflecting the later colonization of this organism. in contrast, igg antibody to gtf of all three streptococcal species remained at low  levels throughout the first four years of life. igg antibody to s. mutans gtf was then the first to appear (4 to less than 8 yr group). serum iga antibodies to all gtfs were not detected until after this time. fifteen sera were used to develop igg immunoblots with the gtf antigens. some positive sera (7/12) demonstrated reaction(s) with gtf from each of the three streptococcal species. individual sera showed igg antibody bonds to gtf from several serotypes of the mutans streptococci. no immunoblot reaction was observed with gtf and sera (3) from the  four-to-seven-year and younger age groups. these results indicate the presence of serum antibody to bacteria and bacterial products associated with plaque formation very early in life and during and after the pre-adolescent years. the potential exists for this serum antibody to modulate bacterial colonization or accumulation in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of nutritional constraints on the biosynthesis of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in a fresh isolate of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a procedure for the purification of enzyme i (ei) and the protein hpr, the general components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, from streptococcus mutans serotype c is presented. the method was also applied successfully to the purification of ei and hpr from streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus sanguis. using specific antibodies obtained against the proteins purified from s. mutans dr0001, we determined quantitatively by rocket electrophoresis the cellular levels of ei and hpr in a freshly isolated strain of s. mutans grown under various conditions in continuous culture. the activity of a few specific eiis was also determined by an in vitro phosphorylation test. results indicated that maximum eii activities for glucose,  mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose were obtained under conditions of glucose limitation, at ph 7.0 and low dilution rate (d = 0.057/h). increasing the amount of glucose or the dilution rate (d = 0.40/h) or decreasing the ph from 7.0 to 5.5 resulted in a 1.4- to 24-fold decrease in these activities. the eii activity for fructose  was not influenced by the growth conditions in the same way as the other eiis. the fructose eii was highest at ph 5.5 and at high dilution rate under conditions of glucose or nitrogen limitation and was always repressed at ph 7.0 and at low dilution rates. the intracellular levels of ei were also dependent on the growth  conditions. the highest concentration (0.65 nmol/mg of protein) was observed in cells grown under glucose limitation at ph 7.0 and high dilution rate, and the lowest concentration (0.12 nmol/mg of protein) was found in cells grown under glucose excess at ph 7.0 and high dilution rate. the other general component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the protein hpr, was not influenced significantly by varying growth conditions.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == the effect of sucrose on the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in pure  and mixed culture in an artificial mouth.
AB  == the roles of sucrose and microbial interactions in the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in an artificial mouth were investigated. the acrylic was colonized by pure cultures of the organism but a visible plaque was not produced  whether or not sucrose was present. salivary bacteria had no effect in the absence of sucrose but when sucrose was present the numbers of c. albicans were significantly increased. it is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the production of extracellular polysaccharides by salivary streptococci in the presence of sucrose. in mixed culture of c. albicans and streptococcus salivarius cj2, growth of the latter was inhibited in the presence of sucrose. this inhibition was due to factors other than ph, although no such antagonism could be demonstrated on solid media.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.

AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

TI  == high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acid composition for chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci.
AB  == a high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to analyze the fatty acid composition of bacterial lipids. after saponification of lipids extracted from bacteria, the liberated fatty acids were labeled with a fluorescence reagent, 4-bromomethyl-7-acetoxycoumarin, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation and fluorescence detection. all bacterial fatty acids were simultaneously separated within 30 min and sensitively determined. this method was applied to the chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci. the fatty acid composition of phospholipids and total lipids distinguished streptococcus mutans from any other  species examined and showed that streptococcus sanguis had a close taxonomic relationship with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == the intra-oral effect on enamel demineralization of extracellular matrix material synthesized from sucrose by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the role of extracellular matrix material (emm) synthesized from sucrose (s) by streptococcus mutans ib-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (iedt). the artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in todd-hewitt broth (thb) supplemented with various s concentrations and by mixing  thb-grown cells with increasing proportions of emm (heat-killed thb + 2% s-cultivated cells). the samples were also evaluated for cell density (dna content) and acidogenicity in vitro (ph-stat), as well as for in situ ph changes  during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. an increase in  the proportion of emm relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. this trend reversed when the ratio of cells to emm was less than 1:19. experiments involving strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius suggested a similar effect of emm. the intra-oral ph data suggest that the presence of emm may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of scrb, the structural gene for the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

TI  == comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == fluoride uptake and fluoride resistance in oral streptococci.
AB  == fluoride uptake was examined in the highly f-sensitive streptococcus salivarius strain 25975, the f-resistant mutant flr103, and the relatively insensitive s. sanguis h7pr3. f was taken up by all strains from media at neutral ph, containing 1 or 10 micrograms f/ml (0.053-0.526 mmol/l), and uptake was directly proportional to the delta ph that was maintained by the cells. the final intracellular concentrations of f in the f-resistant strains were higher than those in the f-sensitive strain. similar differences in f uptake were observed in buffer at ph 5.5, although both delta ph and f uptake were higher in all strains  at the lower ph. these experiments demonstrate that resistance to f does not necessarily involve the exclusion of f from the cells. the lower uptake of f by f-sensitive cells is attributed to the finding that f dissipates the transmembrane ph gradient, and this, in turn, limits the concentration of intracellular f.

TI  == the surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == dissipation of the proton motive force in oral streptococci by fluoride.
AB  == strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular ph (phi) that is more alkaline than the external ph (pho). the delta ph (phi-pho) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of ph 5.5. addition of 10 micrograms of f- per ml at ph 7.0 reduced the delta ph in streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. the reduction of delta ph in s. sanguis h7pr3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta  ph in s. mutans ib 1600 was unaffected. the f- -resistant mutant of s. salivarius, strain flr103, maintained a delta ph of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of f- per ml. addition of f- to cells in media below ph 6.0 led to a reduction of delta ph in all strains. the anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical  gradient of either mutant or parental cells of s. salivarius at ph 7.0. the principal effect of f- addition at neutral ph, therefore, was on the delta ph component of the proton motive force. at ph 5.5, 100 micrograms of f- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mv in the parent and  from 80 to 42 mv in the mutant. we propose that the greater sensitivity of cells  to f- at lower medium ph stems from the rapid dissipation of delta ph by the anion. thus, ph equilibration in media of low ph would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral ph. the data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added f-, is limited when the intracellular ph falls below about 5.7.

AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

AB  == the acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus salivarius atcc 25925, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which  increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. plots of % glucose utilized  during two hours against suspension ph values for cells suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer plus 1 mm mgcl2 plus 13.9 mm glucose indicated, for 50% glucose  utilization, ph values of 5.0 for s. mutans, 5.7 for s. salivarius, and 6.2 for s. sanguis. gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. growth of s. mutans and s. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. minimum ph values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for s. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for s. salivarius. s. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum ph values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for s. mutans or s. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for s. sanguis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == evidence that glucose and sucrose uptake in oral streptococcal bacteria involves  independent phosphotransferase and proton-motive force-mediated mechanisms.
AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

TI  == interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.
AB  == the interaction of purified human plasma fibronectin (fn) with bacteria was studied with a variety of oral streptococci. each of the strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis  tested was aggregated by fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of fn added to the test mixtures. binding assays performed with radiolabeled fn and  various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind fn, and the amount of fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its fn-induced aggregation, with s. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. because of the avid binding of fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto artificial tooth pellicles. immunoreactive fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. furthermore, immunoreactive fn was found to be present in artificial tooth pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. these results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated  by fn. the presence of fn in artificial tooth pellicles suggests that this macromolecule may play a role in the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibition by acarbose, nojirimycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin of glucosyltransferase produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == acarbose is known to inhibit glucoamylase, maltase and sucrase. our aim was to test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase (gtf), to determine the type of inhibition and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of  nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay or by incorporation of radioactivity into product. acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of polysaccharide by gtf from strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, but not by fructosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius. acarbose  and 1-deoxynojirimycin were more potent inhibitors of gtf than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. the mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.

TI  == an improved method for measuring aggregation of certain streptococcal bacteria found in dental plaque.
AB  == various cells were incubated with either dextran or sucrose and the reaction was  terminated by the addition of a 20 per cent solution of formaldehyde. a reaction  mixture consisting of cells and aggregated cells was applied to a step-gradient glycerol column (0-60 per cent) and 0.5 ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the column. non-aggregated cells remained in the top layer of the column. aggregated cells settled in the 30 per cent glycerol layer as determined  by either spectrophotometric or radioactive methods. the amount of aggregated cells demonstrated in this layer increased with either incubation time or concentration of sucrose, dextran or cells. cells of strep, mutans strains 6715,  aht, 10449, omz-176, omz-175 and two mutants of strep. mutans strain 6715 (designated c4 and c307) aggregated strongly. cells of strep. mutans strain lm7 aggregated weakly, whereas cells of strep. mutans 6715 mutant uab165, a mutant defective in aggregation. strep. mutans strain bht, strep. salivarius and strep.  sanguis did not aggregate in the presence of either sucrose or dextran. experiments testing co-aggregation between two different types of cells were done by using 3h-labelled and 14c-labelled cells. strep. mutans strain 6715 co-aggregated with strep. sanguis in the presence of sucrose or dextran, whereas  strep. mutans strain 6715 did not aggregate with strep. salivarius. the method separates aggregated from non-aggregated cells and enables quantitation of sucrose- or dextran-induced aggregation and co-aggregation.

TI  == [viridans streptococci in human infections: identification and susceptibility to  antibiotics].
AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 460  strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 streptococcus mitis, 102 s. sanguis ii, 75 s. sanguis i, 87 s. milleri (streptococcus mg-intermedius), 28 s. mutans, 25 s. salivarius, 14 s. morbillorium, 2 s. uberis and 9 unspeciated. susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (mic greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (mic = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  == plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied.  to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and s. sanguis  constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). a few isolates of "s. mitior" and "s. milleri" were found, but no s. salivarius. staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of s. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. the large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.

TI  == production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (lta) when grown at ph 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. extracellular lta was a minor component in all cases except for l. fermentum and l. casei nird r094 grown in fructose. the total amount of lta (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for  l. salivarius, and also two of the s. sanguis strains. growth of l. fermentum and l. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and ph  of growth can influence the total amount of lta and the proportion of extracellular material. the results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with l. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular lta than l.  casei. however, in fructose-limited cultures l. fermentum formed less total lta and l. casei more so that the differences were only minor. a difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative l. fermentum and the homofermentative l. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.

TI  == microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low ph isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

AB  == the properties of two enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of glucose were studied in three oral streptococci species. the glucokinase of streptococcus mutans had a lower affinity for glucose and atp than did those from s. salivarius and s. sanguis. the enzyme had an identical ph optimum (ph 8.0) in all three bacteria. however, the result from the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system showed a different pattern when its activity was measured using 2-deoxyglucose with toluenized cells. uptake studies of 2-deoxyglucose also revealed that the three microorganisms had different affinities for this compound. this glucose analogue strongly inhibited the acid production of s. salivarius, but did not affect the glycolysis of the other two bacteria.

AB  == the enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. the michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) m, ph optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and mg2+ optima were 2 meq/liter for all. inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) m4. percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mm naf, 2 mm mgso4, 0.5 mm pi, and 0.5 mm 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from  53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. the differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. inhibition was reduced to about 14% at ph 6.0. from  the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of  streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.

AB  == the potential of secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. the importance of specific s-iga antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral s-iga, polymeric myeloma iga, or preabsorbed s-iga. specific antibody molecules bound at the ha surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two streptococcus sanguis strains. in contrast, ha-bound s-iga antibodies inhibited the sorption of streptococcus mitior and streptococcus salivarius. the same was true for streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to ha. comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of iga or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with s-iga or myeloma iga added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarius, and glucose-grown s. mutans was partly attributable to functions of s-iga antibodies. under the in vitro conditions of the study, s-iga antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown s. mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to ha. the results indicated that s-iga can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to ha by several different functions.

AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == an in vitro model for studying adsorption of oral streptococci to crown and bridge cements.
AB  == a sensitive, in vitro method has been developed for the study of bacterial adsorption to dental crown and bridge cements. the method employs heavily radiolabelled cells which adhere to the wall in wells made from the cements. loss of radioactivity from the bacterial suspension during incubation is used to measure the degree of bacterial adherence to the materials. strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans adhered in greater numbers than a  strain of streptococcus salivarius to both a zinc phosphate cement and a zinc carboxylate cement. the zinc phosphate cement supported adherence to a greater degree than did the zinc carboxylate cement. pretreatment of the cement surfaces  with human saliva tended to reduce bacterial adherence. pretreatment of the bacteria with saliva slightly enhanced sorption of s. sanguis and s. salivarius,  but tended to impair sorption of s. mutans to both types of cements. when both bacteria and cements had been pretreated with saliva, a strong inhibition of the  adherence of s. mutans was observed.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == interactions between human serum proteins and oral streptococci reveal occurrence of receptors for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin.
AB  == a total of 31 strains of oral streptococci representing streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus milleri were tested for possible binding of human immunoglobulins g, g1, g2, g3, g4, a1, a2, m1, and m2 and haptoglobin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and aggregated beta 2-microglobulin. radiolabeled beta 2-microglobulin in aggregated form showed affinity for 20 of the 31 strains tested. binding activity for the protein was found in strains belonging to all five species. the bacterial receptor was resistant to trypsin. monomeric, unlabeled beta 2-microglobulin did  not interfere with the binding of the aggregated form. of the other proteins tested, only the immunoglobulin a1 protein showed positive binding, and that was  only with a single strain of s. milleri. beta 2-microglobulin is present on all nucleated cell membranes in vivo. the reaction between aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and oral streptococci is a new type of human-bacterium interaction which should be considered in studies of bacterial adherence.

TI  == bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == opsonization of streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera  from sham-immunized monkeys. antibodies to strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. there was little or no opsonization with actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei, strep, sanguis and strep. salivarius. the exception was strep. cht which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. the results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.

TI  == selective binding of blood group-reactive salivary mucins by streptococcus mutans and other oral organisms.
AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == co-induction of beta-galactosidase and the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) to glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-pts) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. with various strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-pts was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. in all cases, induction of the lactose-pts resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-p-beta-galactosidase. the induction by lactose of both the lactose-pts and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. induction of beta-galactosidase in s. salivarius 25975 by iptg was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. induction experiments with iptg and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism  was a repressor of enzyme activity. exogenous camp was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of s. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, camp, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.

TI  == factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

AB  == the beta plasmid from streptococcus faecalis strain ds5, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was introduced into a lancefield group f streptococcus, strain dr1501, by transformation. this strain, dr1501 (beta), was found to be an excellent donor of the beta plasmid and readily transferred the resistance markers to various lactic acid bacteria, including certain strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. evidence is presented indicating that the transfer of the beta plasmid is mediated by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. the transfer of plasmid dna during conjugation has been confirmed by the isolation of beta plasmid from transconjugant clones and by their ability to then serve as donors of the erythromycin and lincomycin resistance markers.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

AB  == the ultrastructure of streptococcus mutans, serotypes a-e, s. sanguis, s. mitis,  and s. salivarius hht, were examined by the techniques of thin-sectioning and freeze-etching. the cell walls varied in width between 15 and 46 nm and were covered with an electron-dense fibrillar or fuzz layer. the cytoplasmic membrane  was in close association with numerous mesosomes which were, in turn, either closely associated or in contact with the bacterial chromosome. in freeze-etch replicas, the outermost layer of the cell wall was fibrous, and the cytoplasmic membrane was covered with particles composed of several subunits. both particle-clusters and particle-free areas occurred on the surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane, as well as a crystalline array in the ground plasm of the cell.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of streptococcus mutans and related streptococci.
AB  == the cellular fatty acid composition of 18 strains of streptococcus mutans and 17  isolates of related streptococci were examined by gas-liquid chromatography. the  cultures could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their fatty acids. the first group, which included s mutans and s salivarius, contained palmitic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1), stearic (18:0), eicosenoic (20:1), and eicosanoic (20:0) acids. the presence of the two 20-carbon fatty acids distinguished s mutans and s salivarius from all of the other species. two of the s mutans cultures were further distinguished by the presence of 19-carbon and 21-carbon cyclopropane acids. the second group included s sanguis, s mitis, s uberis, and a culture of lancefield group c streptococci. the percentages of the  major acids (16:0, 18:1, and 18:0) found in these species were essentially identical. a culture of lancefield group e streptococci contained large amounts of 16:1 and 18:1 and small amounts of two unidentified acids which were not present in any of the other cultures.

TI  == physiological classification of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  == the human mouth harbors large numbers of a variety of greening streptococci. for  many years the classification and nomenclature of these organisms have been confused, but recent studies have clarified the situation considerably. five distinct species can be distinguished among the oral streptococci s mutans, s sanguis, s mitior, s milleri, and s salivarius, and these may be identified using a simple scheme consisting of seven physiological tests. further subdivisions within these species may be achieved using serological methods. a small number of oral streptococci remain which cannot easily be identified with existing schemes. these may represent additional species that, as yet, have not been adequately described. there seems little justification for continuing the practive of calling all alpha-hemolytic streptococci simple "streptococcus viridans".

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

AB  == dental plaque samples collected from the subjects during the last 20 months of the 2 year trial were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the occurrence of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and the total growth on phenol red agar. lyophilized plaque samples were homogenized and incubated on a sucrose  containing medium under anaerobic conditions. in addition, the ph-values were measured after incubation of the mixed plaque flora in media containing 1% respectively xylitol(x), sorbitol, sucrose (s), fructose (f) or no carbohydrates. the results show a significantly lower incidence of s. mutans in the x-group relative to the s- and f-groups. the corresponding difference could not be observed between the s- and f-groups. the logarithmic means and standard deviations of the colony counts of s. sanguis, s. salivarius and total bacteria yielded no significant differences between the 3 sugar groups during the test period. repeated ph-measurements, carried out at the 4, 12, 18 and 24 month phases, showed that, except in the presence of x, the mean values all fell below  the ph-limit of 5.5. in the course of the study, no evidence was obtained of adaption of mutation enabling acidogenic decomposition of x. these findings emphasize the importance of low acidogenic potential in dental plaque, generally  paralleled by a low incidence of dental caries.

TI  == a method for studying adherence of oral streptococci to solid surfaces.
AB  == the adherence of different streptococci to test pieces of glass, human enamel and whale dentin carried in the mouth or immersed in saliva or bacterial suspensions  was studied by examining the number and frequency of microorganisms which were selectively desorbed by a standardized washing technique. the results obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments were similar in principle. the proportion of streptococci obtained in the first washing resembled that found in the saliva, but with more vigorous washing the proportion of s. sanguis increased while that  of s. salivarius decreased. this illustrates that different microorganisms can attach to solid surfaces with different strengths. the applicability of the method was tested by treating dentin surfaces with fluoride solutions and by incorporating sucrose in the test solution. the fluoride treatment reduced while  the sucrose addition increased the number of streptococci which could be removed  from the surfaces.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

AB  == small samples were taken from the first drop of saliva entering an operation field for root canal treatment isolated by rubber dam, which was intentionally leaky. the samples were primarly cultured in tas- and blh-medium and on ms-agar aerobically. the culture media were inoculated directly and via transport medium  (vmg iii). the cultures were analysed for strep. salivarius, strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

AB  == the ability of streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. the adherence of streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did streptococcus mutans. when bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of s. salivarius and s. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of s. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. the adherence of s. sanguis and s. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps  to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of s. sanguis  and s. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. the results  are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.

AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on  the epithelial surfaces. the adherence of lactobacillus casei and l. fermenti to  oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. the affinity of both lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that  of s. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of s. salivarius. the lactobacilli and both streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and s. salivarius  for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of s. sanguis. the results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. the relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.

TI  == ability of veillonella and neisseria species to attach to oral surfaces and their proportions present indigenously.
AB  == the present study describes the distribution of veillonella and neisseria species in the human oral cavity and indicates that their ability to attach to oral surfaces correlates with their proportions found in various sites of the mouth. the mean percentages of veillonella and neisseria of the total flora cultivable on anaerobic blood-agar plates was found to be: plaque, 0.75 and <0.13, respectively; lip, 0.38 and <0.05; cheek, 0.66 and <0.14; tongue dorsum, 9.4 and  <0.12; saliva, 5.0 and <0.9. the ability of veillonella and neisseria species to  attach to tooth surfaces was studied by cleaning the labial surfaces of incisors  to render them relatively free of viable bacteria. samples taken 1 hr later contained <0.27% veillonella and <0.4% neisseria, whereas saliva to which these teeth were exposed contained 20-fold higher proportions of veillonella. these data indicate that veillonella and neisseria species possess a feeble ability to  attach to cleaned teeth. the ability of these organisms to adhere to other oral surfaces was determined by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of volunteers for 5 min. labeled strains of streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius were included for comparative purposes. analysis of samples obtained from oral surfaces after 45 min indicated that veillonella and neisseria adhere very poorly to preformed dental plaque as compared to s. sanguis. in contrast, veillonella adhered to the tongue dorsum markedly better than neisseria, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. the greater ability of veillonella to adhere to the tongue in relation to the other organisms studied correlates with the high proportions of veillonella found on this site. the feeble ability of neisseria to attach to surfaces in the oral cavity is reflected by their low proportions found on these surfaces.

TI  == selective bacterial adherence to oral epithelial surfaces and its role as an ecological determinant.
AB  == the possible relationship between the ability of streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. strains of s. salivarius and s. sanguis, which are  present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. in contrast, strains of s. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial  surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. s. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of ph 5 to 8. its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. labeled s. salivarius and s. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled s. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. these data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.
