TI  == assignment of eubacterium sp. vpi 12708 and related strains with high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity to clostridium scindens and proposal of clostridium hylemonae sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == unknown eubacterium-like organisms vpi 12708 and five strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) had high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating activity; the unknown clostridium-like organisms tn-271t and tn-272 also had the same activity. analysis of their 16s rdna sequences demonstrated that all strains belong to cluster xiva of the genus clostridium (collins et al., 1994). strain vpi 12708 and five other strains (y-1113, i-10, m-18, th-82 and 36s) formed a single cluster and strains tn-271t and tn-272 formed another single cluster. clostridium scindens jcm 6567t was the most closely related species for two clusters in the phylogenetic tree. values for dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain vpi 12708 and the other five strains were greater than 70%, showing that these micro-organisms were a single species. therefore, we identified strain vpi  12708 and the five other strains as c. scindens. in addition, dna-dna similarities among c. scindens jcm 6567t, strain tn-271t and strain n-272 revealed that strains tn-271t and tn-272 were distinct from c. scindens jcm 6567t. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and dna-dna similarity data, it was  concluded that strains tn-271t and tn-272 are members of a new species of the genus clostridium, for which the name clostridium hylemonae is proposed. the type strain is strain tn-271t (= jcm 10539t).
