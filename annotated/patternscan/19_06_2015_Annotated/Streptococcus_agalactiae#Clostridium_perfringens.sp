TI  == tiscpe8, an is1595-family lincomycin resistance element located on a conjugative  plasmid in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a normal gastrointestinal organism that is a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and can potentially act as a source from which mobile elements and their associated resistance determinants can be transferred to other bacterial pathogens. lincomycin resistance in c. perfringens is common and is usually encoded by erm genes that confer macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance. in this study we identified strains that are lincomycin resistant but erythromycin sensitive and showed that  the lincomycin resistance determinant was plasmid borne and could be transferred  to other c. perfringens isolates by conjugation. the plasmid, pjir2774, is the first conjugative c. perfringens r-plasmid to be identified that does not confer  tetracycline resistance. further analysis showed that resistance was encoded by the lnup gene, which encoded a putative lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase and was located on tiscpe8, a functional transposable genetic element that was a member of the is1595 family of transposon-like insertion sequences. this element  had significant similarity to the mobilizable lincomycin resistance element tissag10 from streptococcus agalactiae. like tissag10, tiscpe8 carries a functional origin of transfer within the resistance gene, allowing the element to be mobilized by the conjugative transposon tn916. the similarity of these elements and the finding that they both contain an orit-like region support the hypothesis that conjugation may result in the movement of dna modules that are not obviously mobile since they are not linked to conjugation or mobilization functions. this process likely plays a significant role in bacterial adaptation and evolution.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == the closely related ermb-ermam genes from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis (pam beta 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) are flanked by variants of a directly repeated sequence.
AB  == the clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance gene, ermbp, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermb-ermam gene from  the promiscuous enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermb-ermam genes. flanking the ermbp structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (dr1 and dr2). these repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. the pam beta 1 and streptococcus agalactiae (pip501) erm determinants appeared to have dr2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in dr1, respectively.  some of the other ermb-ermam class determinants had small portions of dr1, but none had complete copies. it is postulated that the c. perfringens ermbp determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both dr1 and dr2.

TI  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis.
AB  == immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis are active areas of investigation. the past decade has seen development of effective and economical r-mutant vaccines for gram-negative mastitis. these vaccines doubtless will prove beneficial on well managed dairies that have eradicated contagious mastitis pathogens. development of vaccines for other mastitis pathogens has been noticeably slower. a commercially available staphylococcus aureus vaccine appears to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical episodes, but probably has minimal impact on the incidence or prevalence of infection. this product has not  been extensively studied. the recent recognition of virulence factors produced in vivo by staphylococcus aureus may provide a breakthrough in the development and production of staphylococcus aureus vaccines. bacterins employing this principle  presently are not commercially available, however. in the case of all contagious  mastitis pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and mycoplasma spp.), traditional control and eradication efforts (teat dip, dry cow  therapy, culling programs) likely will prove preferable to long-term immunization. ongoing research may provide more efficacious vaccines for these mastitis syndromes. immunostimulants are an active area of research. although leukopoietic factors appear promising as immunostimulants, no compound has clearly demonstrated efficacy in either the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == [specificity against group a, c, and g streptococci of the reverse camp test for  identifying clostridium perfringens].
AB  == we studied "reverse camp" test specificity for the identification of clostridium  perfringens, and the probable existence of cross-reactions with groups a, c and g streptococci. ninety eight clostridium strains were tested with ten s. agalactiae, ten s. pyogenes, two group c streptococci and one group g. all the strains of s. agalactiae yielded a positive "reverse camp" reaction when it was performed with c. perfringens strains. cross-reactions were not detected when c.  perfringens were tested with groups a, c or g streptococci. the "reverse camp" test proved to be specific for all the c. perfringens strains used.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == the camp test performed by using staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase (beta-haemolysin) and clostridium perfringens lecithinase.
AB  == the camp test was performed by employing staphylococcus aureus beta-haemolysin (sphingomyelinase) and clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (lecithinase) for identification of group b streptococci on blood agar, using blood from different  origin. partial purification of cl perfringens alpha-toxin was carried out by means of sheep erythrocytes. with the toxin preparations described positive camp  reaction was obtained only on sheep blood agar. false positives with regard to group a streptococci could not be avoided by either of the methods.

TI  == synergistic haemolysis test for presumptive identification and differentiation of clostridium perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. sordellii, and c. paraperfringens.
AB  == a new test for the presumptive identification of clostridium perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. sordellii, and c. paraperfringens is described. the test is based on the synergistic haemolysis shown by the clostridia and group b streptococci on sheep and human and cacl2-supplemented human blood agar. c. perfringens gave crescent-shaped synergistic lytic zones (7 to over 20 mm in length), and c. paraperfringens usually small-sized (3 mm), bullet-shaped reactions on all three types of media. c. bifermentans showed a horseshoe-shaped  synergistic reaction only on human blood containing media, and c. sordellii only  on cacl2-supplemented human blood agar. c. perfringens type a antiserum inhibited synergistic lytic activities of the four species. the test provided a reliable method for presumptive identification and differentiation of the four clostridial species and may obviate the need for the nagler test.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == synergistic hemolysis phenomenon shown by an alpha-toxin-producing clostridium perfingens and streptococcal camp factor in presumptive streptococcal grouping.
AB  == a new phenomenon of synergistic hemolysis by clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  and the streptococcal camp factor on human and guinea pig erythrocytes is described. a possible mode of action of the camp factors is suggested. on human blood agar all of the tested isolates of group b streptococci gave an arrowhead-shaped zone of hemolysis; 74% of group a gave a crescent-shaped lytic zone, whereas all isolates of groups c and g and the remaining 26% of group a streptococci gave a bullet-shaped lytic zone. by comparison, in the camp test incubated aerobically and anaerobically, 70 and 91%, respectively, of streptococci other than group b gave positive, arrowhead-shaped lytic zones. if all intermediate positive reactions in the camp tests were read as negative after aerobic incubation, only 89% of group b streptococci would be properly identified. the synergistic hemolysis phenomenon, using an alpha-toxin-producing  c. perfringens and human blood agar, provided a reliable test for presumptive identification of group b streptococci, with promising potential to differentiate in the same test group a streptococci from other groups.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
