TI  == production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == biochemical aspects of h. pylori adhesion.
AB  == in analogy with vibrio cholerae and other toxigenic enteropathogens such as yersinia enterocolitica it seems most likely today that h. pylori by specific surface proteins binds to epithelial cell receptors (table 1) allowing the pathogen to deliver urease, vacuolating toxin and other toxic metabolites to cause tissue damage and inflammation (1-3). h. pylori as well as animal gastric pathogens as h. mustelae and h. felis have developed an efficient flagellar apparatus allowing rapid and efficient penetration of the gastric mucus layer (3). most interestingly, flagellae seems to be synthesized in the late stage of growth before the switch of spiral-shaped organisms to coccoidal forms in a liquid medium.
