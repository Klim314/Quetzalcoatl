TI  == transfer of penicillin resistance from streptococcus oralis to streptococcus pneumoniae identifies mure as resistance determinant.
AB  == beta-lactam resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain altered penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes and occasionally an altered murm,  presumably products of interspecies gene transfer. murm and murn are responsible  for the synthesis of branched lipid ii, substrate for the pbp catalyzed transpeptidation reaction. here we used the high-level beta-lactam resistant s. oralis uo5 as donor in transformation experiments with the sensitive laboratory strain s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient. surprisingly, piperacillin resistant transformants contained no alterations in pbp genes but carried mureuo5 encoding  the udp-n-acetylmuramyl tripeptide synthetase. codons 83-183 of mureuo5 were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. moreover, the promoter of mureuo5  which drives a twofold higher expression compared to that of s. pneumoniae r6 could also confer increased resistance. multiple independent transformations produced s. pneumoniae r6 derivatives containing mureuo5 , pbp2xuo5 , pbp1auo5 and pbp2buo5 , but not murmuo5 sequences; however, the resistance level of the donor strain could not be reached. s. oralis uo5 harbors an unusual murm, and murn is absent. accordingly, the peptidoglycan of s. oralis uo5 contained interpeptide bridges with one l-ala residue only. the data suggest that resistance in s. oralis uo5 is based on a complex interplay of distinct pbps and  other enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

TI  == use of maldi biotyper plus clinprotools mass spectra analysis for correct identification of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis/oralis.
AB  == background: differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci is well known to be challenging in clinical laboratories. matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof  ms) had been reported to be a good alternative for streptococcus species level identification. however, differentiation of s. pneumoniae from other streptococcus mitis group organisms was found to be problematic using the bruker  maldi biotyper system. methods: this study used the bruker maldi biotyper system  in addition to a mass spectra model analysis generated by 10 reference strains of s. pneumoniae, 8 strains of s. mitis and 2 strains of s. oralis in the clinprotools to identify 28 clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae and 47 isolates of s. mitis/oralis. the results were compared with those generated by the maldi biotyper system alone. results: the percentages of correct species level identification using the maldi biotyper system alone and the direct transfer and  extraction method were 66.7% (50/75) and 70.7% (53/75), respectively. with the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis, the percentages of correct identification by the direct transfer and extraction method increased to 85.3% (64/75) and 100% (75/75), respectively. this new workflow significantly improved  the accuracy of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis/oralis identification. conclusions: the additional clinprotools mass spectra analysis with extraction method after maldi biotyper identification significantly improved the accuracy of identification among s. pneumoniae, s. oralis and s. mitis. the extra 15 min processing time of spectra analysis should be affordable in most clinical laboratories. we suggest that the same approach could be further explored in handling other bacterial species with high similarities.

TI  == commensal streptococci serve as a reservoir for beta-lactam resistance genes in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and middle ear infections. the incidence of s. pneumoniae isolates that are not susceptible to penicillin has risen worldwide and may be above 20% in some countries. beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in pneumococci is associated with significant sequence polymorphism in penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). commensal streptococci, especially s. mitis and s. oralis, have been identified as putative donors of mutated gene fragments. however, no studies have compared sequences of the involved pbp genes in large collections of commensal streptococci with those of s. pneumoniae. we therefore investigated the sequence  diversity of the transpeptidase region of the three pbp genes, pbp2x, pbp2b, and  pbp1a in 107, 96, and 88 susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, respectively, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels to determine  to what extent homologous recombination between commensal streptococci and s. pneumoniae plays a role in the development of beta-lactam resistance in s. pneumoniae. in contrast to pneumococci, extensive sequence variation in the transpeptidase region of pbp2x, pbp2b, and pbp1a was observed in both susceptible and nonsusceptible strains of commensal streptococci, conceivably reflecting the  genetic diversity of the many evolutionary lineages of commensal streptococci combined with the recombination events occurring with intra- and interspecies homologues. our data support the notion that resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in pneumococci is due to sequences acquired from commensal mitis group streptococci, especially s. mitis. however, several amino acid alterations  previously linked to beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci appear to represent species signatures of the donor strain rather than being causal of resistance.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == identification of proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae by reverse vaccinology and genetic diversity of these proteins in clinical isolates.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. our aim was to identify conserved targets in pneumococci that showed positive prediction for lipoprotein and extracellular subcellular location using bioinformatics programs  and verify the distribution and the degree of conservation of these targets in pneumococci. these targets can be considered potential vaccine candidate to be evaluated in the future. a set of 13 targets were analyzed and confirmed the presence in all pneumococci tested. these 13 genes were highly conserved showing  around >96 % of amino acid and nucleotide identity, but they were also present and show high identity in the closely related species streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. s. oralis clusters away from s. pneumoniae, while s. pseudopneumoniae and s. mitis cluster closer. the divergence between the selected targets was too small to be observed consistently in phylogenetic groups between the analyzed genomes of s. pneumoniae. the proteins analyzed fulfill two of the initial criteria of a vaccine candidate: targets are present in a variety of different pneumococci strains including different serotypes and are conserved among the samples evaluated.

TI  == chemical structures of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide type 39 (cps39), cps47f, and cps34 characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and their relation to cps10a.
AB  == structural characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides  (cps) is a prerequisite for unraveling both antigenic and genetic relationships that exist between different serotypes. in the current study, comparative structural studies of s. pneumoniae cps serogroup 10 (cps10) were extended to include genetically related s. pneumoniae cps34, cps39, and cps47f. high-resolution heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy confirmed the published structure of cps34 and, in conjunction with glycosyl composition analyses, revealed the following repeat unit structures of the other  serotypes, which have not been previously characterized: [structure: see text] common and unique structural features of these polysaccharides, including different positions of o-acetylation, were unambiguously associated with specific genes in each corresponding cps locus. the only exception involved the gene designated wcrc, which is associated with the alpha1-2 transfer of gal pyranoside (galp) to ribitol-5-phosphate in the synthesis of cps10a, cps47f, and cps34 but with alpha1-1 transfer of gal to ribitol-5-phosphate in the synthesis of cps39. the corresponding gene in the cps39 locus, although related to wcrc, more closely resembled a previously identified gene (i.e., wefm) of streptococcus oralis that  is associated with alpha1-1 transfer of galp to ribitol-5-phosphate. these and other recent findings identify linkages from alpha-galp to ribitol-5-phosphate and from this residue to adjacent gal furanoside (galf) as important sites of cps structural and genetic diversity.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == streptococcal taxonomy based on genome sequence analyses.
AB  == the identification of the clinically relevant viridans streptococci group, at species level, is still problematic. the aim of this study was to extract taxonomic information from the complete genome sequences of 67 streptococci, comprising 19 species, by means of genomic analyses, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), average amino acid identity (aai), genomic signatures, genome-to-genome distances (ggd) and codon usage bias. we then attempted to determine the usefulness of these genomic tools for species identification in streptococci. our results showed that mlsa, aai and ggd analyses are robust markers to identify streptococci at the species level, for instance, s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s.  oralis. a streptococcus species can be defined as a group of strains that share >/= 95% dna similarity in mlsa and aai, and > 70% dna identity in ggd. this approach allows an advanced understanding of bacterial diversity.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == [a novel typing method and scheme for streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == study aim: to introduce a novel molecular pcr method for the typing of streptococcus pneumonia in the national reference laboratory (nrl) for streptococcal infections. material and methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the nrl from different regions of the czech republic.  generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the quellung reaction.  since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mpcr) assay has been introduced. the novel assay was tested on 210 s. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species s. pseudopneumoniae, s. sanguinis, and s. oralis. results: the nrl for streptococcal infections has included a novel mpcr assay in  the algorithm of s. pneumoniae identification and typing. the mpcr assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the  isolates of the related species remaining negative. the mpcr assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. the pcr appeared to be an excellent tool for s. pneumoniae typing. conclusion: until recently, s. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (quellung reaction), but the nrl for streptococcal infections has switched to a novel mpcr assay. this molecular tool improves s. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate.

TI  == identification of clinical streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among other alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci by use of the vitek ms matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system.
AB  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relatives of the viridans group is a common difficulty in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry-based identification. in  the present study, the performances of the vitek ms maldi-tof mass spectrometry system were assessed using 334 pneumococci, 166 other s. mitis group streptococci, 184 non-s. mitis group streptococci, and 19 related alpha- and nonhemolytic aerobic gram-positive catalase-negative coccal isolates. pneumococci had been identified by means of optochin susceptibility and bile solubility or serotyping, and other isolates mainly by use of rapidid32 strep strips. in case of discordant or low-discrimination results, genotypic methods were used. the sensitivity of the vitek ms for the identification of s. pneumoniae was 99.1%, since only three bile-insoluble isolates were misidentified as streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis. conversely, two optochin-resistant pneumococci were correctly identified (specificity, 100%). three streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolates were also correctly identified. among nonpneumococcal isolates, 90.8% (n = 335) were correctly identified to the species or subspecies level and 2.4% (n = 9) at the group level. for the remaining 25 isolates, the vitek ms proposed a bacterial species included in the list of possible species suggested by genotypic methods, except for 4 isolates which were not identified due to the absence of the species in the database. according to our study, the vitek ms displays performance similar to that of the optochin susceptibility test for routine identification of pneumococcal isolates. moreover, the vitek ms is efficient for  the identification of other viridans group streptococci and related isolates, provided that the species are included in the database.

TI  == discrimination between streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis based on  sorting of their maldi mass spectra.
AB  == accurate species-level identification of alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci  (vgs) is very important for understanding their pathogenicity and virulence. however, an extremely high level of similarity between vgs within the mitis group (s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, s. oralis and s. pseudopneumoniae) often results in misidentification of these organisms. earlier, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been suggested as  a tool for the rapid identification of s. pneumoniae. however, by using biotyper  3.0 (bruker) or vitek ms (biomerieux) databases, streptococcus mitis/oralis species can be erroneously identified as s. pneumoniae. clinprotools 2.1 software was used for the discrimination of maldi-tof mass spectra of 25 s. pneumoniae isolates, 34 s. mitis and three s. oralis. phenotypical tests and multilocus gene typing schemes for the s. pneumoniae (http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/) and viridans  streptococci (http://viridans.emlsa.net/) were used for the identification of isolates included in the study. the classifying model was generated based on different algorithms (genetic algorithm, supervised neural network and quickclassifier). in all cases, values of sensitivity and specificity were found  to be equal or close to 100%, allowing discrimination of mass spectra of different species. three peaks (6949, 9876 and 9975 m/z) were determined conferring the maximal statistical weight onto each model built. we find this approach to be promising for viridans streptococci discrimination.

TI  == characterization of recombinant fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococcus-like isolates.
AB  == fourteen fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococcal isolates with recombinant dna topoisomerase genes, preliminarily identified as pneumococci, were further characterized using phenotypic and genotypic approaches. phenotypic tests classified them as atypical pneumococci. phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by using the sequences of seven housekeeping alleles from these isolates and from isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. four isolates grouped with s. pneumoniae, seven grouped with s. pseudopneumoniae, and three grouped with s. mitis. these results generally agreed with those obtained with an optochin susceptibility test and with the organization of the atp operon chromosomal region, encoding the f(o)f(1) h(+)-atpase (the target of optochin). all seven isolates grouping with s. pseudopneumoniae share the same spr1368-atpc-atpa gene order; all four grouping with s. pneumoniae share the spr1368-is1239-atpc-atpa order, and two out of the three grouping with s. mitis share the spr1284-atpc-atpa order. in addition, evidence for recombination within the seven housekeeping alleles of the s. pseudopneumoniae population was provided by several methods: the index of association (0.4598, p < 0.001), the pairwise homoplasy index, and the split-decomposition method. this study confirms the existence of pneumococci among the alpha-hemolytic streptococci with dna topoisomerase genes showing a mosaic structure and reveals a close relationship between atypical pneumococci and s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == the enhanced pneumococcal lamp assay: a clinical tool for the diagnosis of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in developed and developing countries. we studied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) technique to assess its suitability for detecting s. pneumoniae nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). methodology/principal findings: we established an improved lamp assay targeting the lyta gene (streptococcus pneumoniae [sp] lamp). the analytical specificity of the primers was validated by using 32 reference strains (10 streptococcus and seven non-streptococcus species) plus 25 clinical alpha-hemolytic streptococcal strains, including four s. pneumoniae strains and 21 other strains (3 s. oralis,  17 s. mitis, and one streptococcus species) harboring virulence factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply). within 30 minutes, the assay could detect as few as 10 copies of both purified dna and spiked csf specimens with greater sensitivity than conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the linear determination range for this assay is 10 to 1,000,000 microorganisms per reaction mixture using real-time turbidimetry. we evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of  the sp lamp assay using 106 randomly selected csf specimens from children with suspected meningitis in korea, china and vietnam. for comparison, csf specimens were also tested against conventional pcr and culture tests. the detection rate of the lamp method was substantially higher than the rates of pcr and culture tests. in this small sample, relative to the lamp assay, the clinical sensitivity of pcr and culture tests was 54.5% and 33.3%, respectively, while clinical specificity of the two tests was 100%. conclusions/significance: compared to pcr, sp lamp detected s. pneumoniae with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. this specific and sensitive lamp method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == streptococcus tigurinus, a novel member of the streptococcus mitis group, causes  invasive infections.
AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == immune reactivity of four monoclonal and two polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant pneumococcal surface adhesin a.
AB  == in this study four monoclonal antibodies (mabs) and two polyclonal antisera were  raised against pneumococcal surface adhesion a (psaa), a 37 kda cell wall protein, and were characterized. the mabs were purified, isotyped, and epitope mapped with peptide microarrays. all monoclonals and polyclonals underwent testing in immunodot blot, western blot, and elisa assays to assess their specificity. all monoclonal antibodies belonged to isotype igg1 kappa. peptide microarray mapping identified two likely epitopes, which could not be confirmed using synthetic peptides of the identified amino acid sequence. all four mabs detected the 53 pneumococcal serotypes tested in the immunodot blot and only reacted with streptococcus pseudopneumoniae in cross-reactivity studies by western blot. the polyclonal antisera also recognized all tested pneumococcal serotypes and cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus oralis by  western blot. the mabs cross-reacted with s. pseudopneumoniae in the elisa. both  polyclonal antisera cross-reacted with all isolates tested in the elisa. these antisera should be suitable to establish a diagnostic elisa platform for pneumococcal antigen detection with polyclonal antisera as the capture antibody.  the specificity of the four mabs appears to be high as they only recognized s. pneumoniae and s. pseudopneumoniae. however, further testing of closely related streptococcal species is necessary to confirm this finding.

TI  == comparative transcriptomic analysis of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with viridans group streptococci.
AB  == background: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, is a novel member of the genus streptococcus, falling close to related members like s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. its recent appearance has shed light on streptococcal infections, which has been unclear till recently. in this study, the transcriptome of s. pseudopneumoniae ccug 49455t was analyzed using the s. pneumoniae r6 microarray platform and compared with those of s. pneumoniae kctc 5080t, s. mitis kctc 3556t, and s. oralis kctc 13048t strains. results: comparative transcriptome analysis revealed the extent of genetic relatedness among the species, and implies that s. pseudopneumoniae is the most closely related to s. pneumoniae. a  total of 489, 444 and 470 genes were upregulated while 347, 484 and 443 were downregulated relative to s. pneumoniae in s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis and s.  mitis respectively. important findings were the up-regulation of tcs (two component systems) and transposase which were found to be specific to s. pseudopneumoniae. conclusions: this study provides insight to the current understanding of the genomic content of s. pseudopneumoniae. the comparative transcriptome analysis showed hierarchical clustering of expression data of s. pseudopneumoniae with s. pneumoniae and s. mitis with s. oralis. this proves that transcriptional profiling can facilitate in elucidating the genetic distance between closely related strains.

TI  == sequetyping: serotyping streptococcus pneumoniae by a single pcr sequencing strategy.
AB  == the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines necessitates continued monitoring of circulating strains to assess vaccine efficacy and replacement serotypes. conventional serological methods are costly, labor-intensive, and prone to misidentification, while current dna-based methods have limited serotype coverage requiring multiple pcr primers. in this study, a computer algorithm was  developed to interrogate the capsulation locus (cps) of vaccine serotypes to locate primer pairs in conserved regions that border variable regions and could differentiate between serotypes. in silico analysis of cps from 92 serotypes indicated that a primer pair spanning the regulatory gene cpsb could putatively amplify 84 serotypes and differentiate 46. this primer set was specific to streptococcus pneumoniae, with no amplification observed for other species, including s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pseudopneumoniae. one hundred thirty-eight  pneumococcal strains covering 48 serotypes were tested. of 23 vaccine serotypes included in the study, most (19/22, 86%) were identified correctly at least to the serogroup level, including all of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and other replacement serotypes. reproducibility was demonstrated by the correct sequetyping of different strains of a serotype. this novel sequence-based method  employing a single pcr primer pair is cost-effective and simple. furthermore, it  has the potential to identify new serotypes that may evolve in the future.

TI  == biosynthesis of teichoic acids in streptococcus pneumoniae and closely related species: lessons from genomes.
AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus pneumoniae contains an unusually complex wall teichoic acid (wta), which has identical repeating units as the membrane-anchored lipoteichoic acid (lta). both polymers share a common cytoplasmic pathway of precursor synthesis, but several ta enzymes have remained elusive. bioinformatic  analysis of the genome of various pneumococcal strains, including choline-independent mutant strains, has allowed us to identify the missing ta genes. we present here the deduced complete pathways of wta and lta synthesis in  s. pneumoniae and point to the variations occurring in different pneumococcal strains and in closely related species such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae identification by pherotype: a method to assist understanding of a potentially emerging or overlooked pathogen.
AB  == the recent identification of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (pseudopneumococcus)  has complicated classification schemes within members of the "mitis" streptococcal group. accurate differentiation of this species is necessary for understanding its disease potential and identification in clinical settings. this work described the use of the competence-stimulatory peptide comc sequence for identification of s. pseudopneumoniae. comc sequences from clinical sources were  determined for 17 strains of s. pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis. an additional 58 comc sequences from a range of sources were included to understand the diversity and suitability of this protein as a diagnostic marker for species identification. we identified three pherotypes for  this species, delineated csp6.1 (10/14, 79%), csp6.3 (3/14, 21%), and sk674 (1/14, 7%). pseudopneumococcal comc sequences formed a discrete cluster within those of other oral streptococci. this suggests that the comc sequence could be used to identify s. pseudopneumoniae, thus simplifying the study of the pathogenic potential of this organism. to avoid confusion between pneumococcal and pseudopneumococcal pherotypes, we have renamed the competence pherotype csp6.1, formerly reported as an "atypical" pneumococcus, cspps1 to reflect its occurrence in s. pseudopneumoniae.

TI  == cell surface proteins in s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis.
AB  == background and objectives: streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, is closely related to the commensal species s. mitis and s. oralis. s. pneumoniae surface proteins are implicated in virulence and host interaction of this species, but many of them have recently been detected in s. mitis b6 in silico. we tested for the presence of such genes usinga set of eight s. mitis and eleven  s. oralis strains from different geographic locations. materials and methods: an  oligonucleotide microarray was designed based on the genomes of s. pneumoniae r6  and tigr4 as well as s. mitis b6 to include 63 cell surface proteins. the s. pneumoniae genes encoding neuraminidases, hyaluronidase and pneumolysin were also included. in addition to comparative genomic hybridization experiments, homologues were identified in silico in the genome of s. oralis uo5. results and  conclusions: the results document that many s. pneumoniae related surface proteins are ubiquitously present among the mitis group of streptococci. all 19 samples hybridized with the pava probe representing a gene important for adherence and invasion of s. pneumoniae. only eight genes were not recognized in  any strain, including the s. pneumoniae pcpc gene as the only virulence gene of the s. pneumoniae core genome.the fact that only 12 out of 26 genes present in the s. oralis uo5 genome could be detected by microarray analysis confirms the sequence variation of surface components.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == misidentification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by routine tests in clinical practice.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == identification of genes for small non-coding rnas that belong to the regulon of the two-component regulatory system ciarh in streptococcus.
AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == contribution of plasminogen activation towards the pathogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == oral streptococci are a heterogeneous group of human commensals, with a potential to cause serious infections. activation of plasminogen has been shown to increase the virulence of typical human pathogenic streptococci such as s. pneumoniae. one important factor for plasminogen activation is the streptococcal alpha-enolase. here we report that plasminogen activation is also common in oral streptococci species involved in clinical infection and that it depends on the action of human plasminogen activators. the ability to activate plasminogen did not require full  conservation of the internal plasminogen binding sequence motif fydkerkvy of alpha-enolase that was previously described as crucial for increased plasminogen  binding, activation and virulence. instead, experiments with recombinant alpha-enolase variants indicate that the naturally occurring variations do not impair plasminogen binding. in spite of these variations in the internal plasminogen binding motif oral streptococci showed similar activation of plasminogen. we conclude that the pathomechanism of plasminogen activation is conserved in oral streptococci that cause infections in human. this may contribute to their opportunistic pathogenic character that is unfurled in certain niches.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == new species genetic approach to identify strains of mitis group streptococci that are donors of rifampin resistance to streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == eight rifampin-resistant streptococci of the mitis group were identified at the species level by using a concatenated 16s rrna gene-soda-rpob-hlpa sequence. characterization of their rpob alleles showed single amino acid changes involved  in rifampin resistance. comparison of rpob sequences from pneumococcal recombinant isolates, viridans isolates, and type strains revealed a species-specific amino acid signature, which allowed it to be ascertained that recombinant rpobs were originated in genetic interchanges with streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis.

TI  == structure and dynamics of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae and closely  related species.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. the genomes of 44 diverse strains of s. pneumoniae  were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the mitis group. results: despite evidence of extensive recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site  of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s.  pneumoniae. genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome size of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all s. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. conclusions: genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumoniae. the open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.

TI  == comparison of maldi tof with conventional identification of clinically relevant bacteria.
AB  == background: a completely new approach to diagnose microbial agents at least one day earlier based on mass spectrometric analysis becomes possible in the microbiology laboratory: maldi tof: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight. comparison between results of the new procedure with those obtained by conventional testing is mandatory. methods: 204 clinical isolates grown on agar plates were analysed both, by the maldi tof bruker microflex apparatus and by conventional identification using the vitek ii and api systems,  both from biomerieux. results: of the identified isolates, 72 were gram-positive  and 130 gram-negative; 2 were yeasts (candida). concordance was seen with 61/72 (85%) of the gram-positive bacteria and with 115/130 (88%) of the gram-negative bacteria. in 27 samples (13.2%), a discrepancy of the species and/or genus was obvious. the discrepancy appeared with 16 gram-negative (12.2%) and with 11 gram-positive germs (15.3%, n.s.). in the latter group, 6 samples showed discordance with streptococcus pneumoniae (maldi) and streptococcus mitis/oralis  (conventional identification) constellation. among gram-negative samples, most differences occurred on the species level only, e.g. enterobacter cloacae versus  enterobacter kobei. in 5 cases, discordance was major and appeared on the genus level: enterobacter/raoultella, streptococcus/gemella, pseumdomonas/burkholderia, microbacter/sphingomonas and candida/cryptococcus. the most outstanding difference was microbacterium arborescens (maldi tof) and sphingomonas paucimobilis (conventional). molecular biological identification of two streptococcus mitis group bacteria confirmed the erroneous diagnosis by maldi tof of streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: good comparability between maldi tof analysis and conventional identification procedures (86.8%) but special caution is needed when identifying streptococcal species.

TI  == genome sequence of the temperate bacteriophage ph10 from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == exponential growing cultures of streptococcus oralis strain omz 1038, isolated from human supragingival dental plaque, were found to release a bacteriophage (designated ph10) upon treatment with mitomycin c. the complete genome sequence of phage ph10 was determined. the genome was 31276 bp in size and contained 54 open reading frames. the module encoding structural proteins was highly similar to that of streptococcus pneumoniae prophage phispn_3. the most abundant phage structural protein was encoded by orf35 and was likely processed by proteolytic cleavage. the putative endolysin from ph10, which contained a muramidase domain and a choline-binding domain, was purified and shown to have lytic activity with  s. oralis, s. pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis, but not with other streptococcal species.

TI  == the rgg gene is a specific marker for streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although the pathogenesis of streptococcus oralis may be different from that of other viridans group streptococci, s. oralis shares a high degree of dna sequence similarity with these streptococci. as a result, discrimination of s. oralis from its close relatives has long been considered difficult. this study was conducted  to find specific genes that allow for the in vitro identification of s. oralis, but not other oral commensals. four hundred ninety s. oralis clones obtained by suppressive subtractive hybridization were used for southern hybridization, and positive clones were sequenced. of 5 s. oralis-specific clones, newly designed primer sets based on the glucosyltransferase regulatory gene amplified genomic dna only from s. oralis strains, but not from any of the other 125 strains tested. our findings may be useful for the future development of efficient diagnostic tools for the rapid identification and differentiation of s. oralis from other oral streptococci strains.

TI  == real-time pcr assays for the detection and quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the main etiologic agent of pneumonia worldwide. because the members of the viridans group streptococci share a high degree of dna sequence homologies, phenotypic and genotypic discriminations of s. pneumoniae from the viridans group are difficult. a quantitative real-time pcr assay targeting the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene (cpsa) was developed as a species-specific detection tool for s. pneumoniae. the specificity was evaluated  using genomic dnas extracted from 135 oral cocci strains. twenty-seven s. pneumoniae strains tested positive, whereas 108 other strains including streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis did not show a specific signal. the linear regression of standard curves indicated high correlations between the log numbers of s. pneumoniae cells and the c(t) values (r(2)=0.99). the minimal limit of detection was 32 fg of purified genomic  dna, equivalent to 14 genomes of s. pneumoniae. this new real-time pcr method may be very useful as a rapid and specific tool for detecting and quantifying s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of the cpsa gene as a specific marker for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the aetiological agent of pneumonia and non-gonococcal  urethritis, shares a high degree of dna sequence identity with the viridans group of streptococci, particularly streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. although their clinical and pathological manifestations are different, discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives is still quite difficult. suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify the genomic differences between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis. thirty-four  resulting s. pneumoniae-specific clones were examined by sequence determination and comparative dna sequence analysis using blast. s. pneumoniae-specific primers were subsequently designed from one of the clonal dna sequences containing the cps gene (coding for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis). the primer specificities were evaluated using 49 viridans streptococci including 26 s. pneumoniae, 54 other streptococci, 14 lactococcus species, 14 enterococcus species and three vagococcus species, and compared with the specificities of previously described autolysin (lyta), pneumolysin (ply), spn9802 and spn9828 primers. the newly designed cpsa-specific primer set was highly specific to s. pneumoniae and was even better than the existing primers. these findings may help improve the rapid identification and differentiation of s. pneumoniae from closely related members of the viridans group streptococci.

TI  == structure and molecular characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 10f by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of serotype 10f streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (rps) of streptococcus oralis c104 have distinct ecological roles. cps prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic s. pneumoniae, whereas rps of commensal s. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. results from high resolution nmr identified  the recognition region of s. oralis rps (i.e. galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of s. pneumoniae cps10f. the failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of galf, which occurred as a branch in cps10f rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in rps. carbohydrate engineering of s. oralis rps with wzy from s. pneumoniae attributed formation of  the galf branch in cps10f to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub  terminal galnac in galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha rather than through terminal  galf, as in rps. a gene (wcrd) from serotype 10a s. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in s. oralis that was identical to rps except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between galf and galnacbeta1-3galalpha. this polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of a.  naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked galf in recognition of adjacent galnacbeta1-3galalpha in wild-type rps. these findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of s. oralis rps from s. pneumoniae cps.

TI  == rpoa is a useful gene for identification and classification of streptococcus pneumoniae from the closely related viridans group streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading etiological agent of pneumonia, shares a high degree of dna sequence homology with the viridans group of streptococci. the clinical and pathological manifestations may present with different features, and discrimination between s. pneumoniae and its close viridans cocci relatives, such as streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, is still quite difficult. the 445-bp sequences of the n-terminal region of rpoa from nine s. pneumoniae, seven  s. mitis, ten s. oralis, and two related strains were determined and compared with their respective 16s rrna gene sequences to establish their usefulness in phylogenetic analysis. pairwise comparisons of rpoa sequences among the species showed higher rates of evolution with lower similarities (92.3-100%) than those of 16s rrna genes (96.8-100%). the rpoa-based phylogeny generated deeper branches and presented improved discriminatory resolution than the 16s rrna gene-based phylogeny. these results show that rpoa sequences represent a consistent, but more discriminating, genomic marker than 16s rrna gene sequences for investigating the evolutionary relationships of streptococcus at the species level. rpoa could be a useful marker for identifying and classifying s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis from closely related taxa.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of pcr-amplified gki genes: a new technique for tracking streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are a well-known cause of infections in immunocompromised patients, accounting for severe morbidity and mortality. streptococcus mitis group species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis) are among the vgs most often encountered in clinical practice. identifying the portal of entry for s. mitis group strains is crucial for interventions preventing bacterial translocation. unfortunately, tracking the source of s. mitis group strains is dependent on a combination of extremely laborious and time-consuming cultivation and molecular techniques (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-pcr [eric-pcr]). to simplify this procedure, a pcr analysis with newly designed primers targeting the household gene glucose kinase (gki) was used in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). this gki-pcr-dgge technique proved to be specific for s. mitis group strains. moreover, these strains could be detected in samples comprised of highly diverse microbiota, without prior cultivation. to study the feasibility of this new approach, a pilot study was performed. this confirmed that the source of s. mitis group bacteremia in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia could be tracked back to the throat in five out of six episodes of bacteremia, despite the fact that throat samples are polymicrobial samples containing multiple s. mitis group strains. in contrast, using the classical combination of cultivation techniques and eric-pcr, we could detect these strains in only two out of six cases, showing the superiority of the newly  developed technique. the new gki-pcr-dgge technique can track the source of s. mitis group strains in polymicrobial samples without prior cultivation. therefore, it is a valuable tool in future epidemiological studies.

AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

AB  == the antigenically related coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus oralis strains c104 and sk144 mediate recognition of these bacteria by other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. in the present study, the structure of strain sk144 rps was established by high resolution nmr spectroscopy as [6galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha1-2ribitol-5-po(4)(-)-6galfbeta1-3galbeta1](n), thereby indicating that this polysaccharide and the previously characterized rps  of strain c104 are identical, except for the linkage between gal and ribitol-5-phosphate, which is alpha1-2 in strain sk144 versus alpha1-1 in strain  c104. studies to define the molecular basis of rps structure revealed comparable  genes for six putative transferases and a polymerase in the rps loci of these streptococci. cell surface rps production was abolished by disrupting the gene for the first transferase of strain c104 with a nonpolar erm cassette. it was restored in the resulting mutant by plasmid-based expression of either wcjg, the  corresponding gene of s. pneumoniae for serotype 10a capsular polysaccharide (cps) biosynthesis or wbap for the transferase of salmonella enterica that initiates o-polysaccharide biosynthesis. thus, wcjg, like wbap, appears to initiate polysaccharide biosynthesis by transferring galactose-1-phosphate to a lipid carrier. in further studies, the structure of strain c104 rps was converted to that of strain sk144 by replacing the gene (wefm) for the fourth transferase in the rps locus of strain c104 with the corresponding gene (wcrc) of strain sk144 or streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 10a. these findings identify genetic markers for the different ribitol-5-phosphate-containing types of rps present in  s. oralis and establish a close relationship between these polysaccharides and serogroup 10 cpss of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == [the analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to fess method].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the fess method. material and methods: studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. during the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. results: in the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. in 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: cotrimoxazole, rifampicin, vankomycin, teicoplanin and levofloxacin. staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. another bacteria (escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. in 3 cultures (4.17%) we found klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100%  resistance to penicillins. in three cases pseudomonas fluorescens and proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of klebsiella pneumoniae. two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures  were noted: citrobacter freundii, streptococcus oralis and hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and cefuroxime was as high as 100%. conclusion: in the  operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. this indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. the cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == different pathways of choline metabolism in two choline-independent strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and their impact on virulence.
AB  == the two recently characterized streptococcus pneumoniae strains--r6chi and r6cho(-)--that have lost the unique auxotrophic requirement of this bacterial species for choline differ in their mechanisms of choline independence. in strain r6chi the mechanism is caused by a point mutation in tacf, a gene that is part of the pneumococcal lic2 operon, which is essential for growth and survival of the bacteria. cultures of lic2 mutants of the encapsulated strain d39chi growing in choline-containing medium formed long chains, did not autolyze, had no choline in their cell wall, and were completely avirulent in the mouse intraperitoneal model. in contrast, while the cho(-) strain carried a complete pneumococcal lic2  operon and had no mutations in the tacf gene, deletion of the entire lic2 operon  had no effect on the growth or phenotype of strain cho(-). these observations suggest that the biochemical functions normally dependent on determinants of the  pneumococcal lic2 operon may also be carried out in strain cho(-) by a second set of genetic elements imported from streptococcus oralis, the choline-independent streptococcal strain that served as the dna donor in the heterologous transformation event that produced strain r6cho(-). the identification in r6cho(-) of a large (20-kb) s. oralis dna insert carrying both tacf and licd genes confirms this prediction and suggests that these heterologous elements may  represent a "backup" system capable of catalyzing p-choline incorporation and export of teichoic acid chains under conditions in which the native lic2 operon is not functional.

TI  == a predatory mechanism dramatically increases the efficiency of lateral gene transfer in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == bacteria that are competent for natural genetic transformation, such as pneumococci and their commensal relatives streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, take up exogenous dna and incorporate it into their genomes by homologous recombination. traditionally, it has been assumed that genetic material leaking from dead bacteria constitutes the sole source of external dna for competent streptococci. here we describe a mechanism for active acquisition of homologous dna that dramatically increases the efficiency of gene exchange between and within the streptococcal species mentioned above. this mechanism gives competent  streptococci access to a common gene pool that is significantly larger than their own genomes, a property representing a considerable advantage when these bacteria are subjected to external selection pressures, such as vaccination and treatment  with antibiotics.

TI  == mutations in the tacf gene of clinical strains and laboratory transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae: impact on choline auxotrophy and growth rate.
AB  == the nutritional requirement that streptococcus pneumoniae has for the aminoalcohol choline as a component of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids appears to be exclusive to this prokaryote. a mutation in the tacf gene, which putatively encodes an integral membrane protein (possibly, a teichoic acid repeat unit transporter), has been recently identified as responsible for generating a choline-independent phenotype of s. pneumoniae (m. damjanovic, a. s. kharat, a. eberhardt, a. tomasz, and w. vollmer, j. bacteriol. 189:7105-7111, 2007). we now  report that streptococcus mitis can grow in choline-free medium, as previously illustrated for streptococcus oralis. while we confirmed the finding by damjanovic et al. of the involvement of tacf in the choline dependence of the pneumococcus, the genetic transformation of s. pneumoniae r6 by using s. mitis sk598 dna and several pcr-amplified tacf fragments suggested that a minimum of two mutations were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent s.  pneumoniae mutants. this conclusion is supported by sequencing results also reported here that indicate that a spontaneous mutant of s. pneumoniae (strain jy2190) able to proliferate in the absence of choline (or analogs) is also a double mutant for the tacf gene. microscopic observations and competition experiments during the cocultivation of choline-independent strains confirmed that a minimum of two amino acid changes were required to confer improved fitness to choline-independent pneumococcal strains when growing in medium lacking any aminoalcohol. our results suggest complex relationships among the different regions of the tacf teichoic acid repeat unit transporter.

AB  == objective: to assess the value of aspergillus galactomannan (gm) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (ipa). methods: ninety adult sd rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including 4 groups of pulmonary infection by aspergillus fumigatus (a. fumigatus), candida albicans, mucor, and streptococcus pneumoniae,  respectively, and a colonization group by a. fumigatus in the pharynx oralis (n = 18 each). for the infection models, suspensions of pathogenic bacteria and fungi  were instilled into the lungs of the rats by tracheal intubation. for the colonization model, the suspension of a. fumigatus was applied to the nasal cavity and pharynx oralis of the rats. the animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7,  and 12 after inoculation, and blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and used for gm detection. the lung tissues were prepared for routine pathology examination, and hexamethylene tetramine silver staining was used to detect the fungi. a double-direct sandwich elisa was employed to detect gm optical density index in the serum samples. results: the lung tissues of rats infected with a. fumigatus, candida albicans, mucor and streptococcus pneumoniae all showed remarkable inflammatory reactions, and hyphae were observed in rats with fungal infection (including a. fumigatus and mucor), and spores in rats infected with candida albicans. the lung tissues of the a. fumigatus colonization rats showed no inflammatory reactions. the serum gm optical density index of the groups infected with a. fumigatus, candida albicans, mucor and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the a. fumigatus colonization group were 1.69 +/- 0.29, 0.89 +/- 0.46, 0.87 +/- 0.39, 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.90 +/- 0.49, respectively. the serum gm optical density index of the ipa group was higher than those of the other 4 groups (p < 0.05). if the cutoff odi was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) for diagnosis of ipa in the rats were 78.6%, 87.5%, 57.9% and 94.9%, respectively. the sensitivity for a. fumigatus infection on days 3, 7, and 12 was 60.0%, 80% and 100%, and the specificity was 95.5%, 81.0% and 85.7%, respectively. conclusion: gm detection could distinguish aspergillus infection from candida albicans, mucor, streptococcus pneumoniae infection and aspergillus colonization. the sensitivity  of the test for the diagnosis of ipa tended to be higher with longer duration of  infection. a cutoff odi of 1.5 showed the best sensitivity and specificity for ipa in this rat model.

AB  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 were studied for their probiotic potential.  firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains streptococcus oralis lmg 14532t and streptococcus pneumoniae lmg 14545t. s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 was active against the majority  of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. the three potential probiotic strains were found  to survive variably at ph 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. only s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the  strains was haemolytic. moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-12, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory il-10 were observed with l. fermentum aca-dc 179. this strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a tnbs-induced colitis mouse model. furthermore, l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was successfully applied in an experimental salmonella-infection mouse model. to conclude, strain l. fermentum aca-dc 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  == genetic relatedness of the streptococcus pneumoniae capsular biosynthetic loci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (cps) that define the serotype. the cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose cps is synthesized by the wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (hgs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared hgs. the cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. all serotypes within the same serogroup  fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. the closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known cps structures to relate gene content to structure. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas  the streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.

[4]]. the concentration of the cwps antibodies in non-immunized individuals often exceeds the concentration of the serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies. therefore, the pneumococcal elisa requires an adsorption step to remove the unprotective cwps antibodies [konradsen hb, sorensen ub, henrichsen j. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring type-specific anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies. j immunol meth 1993;164(1):13-20.

[8]]. recently a new pneumococcal cps elisa was recommended with an extra serum absorption step with 22f cps to remove antibodies against an extra unknown common cross-reactive component. the aim of this study was to characterize the active component in the  22f capsule. a non-capsulated pneumococci was prepared from a 22f capsulated pneumococci. the cell wall polysaccharide (cwps2) purified from this pneumococci  has a better adsorption potential than 22f capsule in the pneumococci elisa. structure characterization of the commercial available cwps and cwps2 was done by nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). the nmr results showed that commercial cwps had one phosporylcholine per sugar repeat while the cwps2 had two phosporylcholine per sugar repeat explaining an immunological difference between the two variants  of cwps. in addition the licd2 gene responsible for the attachment of the second  cholin in the cwps tetra sugar repeat was inactive in the strain used for purifying the commercial cwps but active in the strain expressing cwps2.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance in atypical pneumococci and oral streptococci: evidence of horizontal gene transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == atypical strains, presumed to be pneumococcus, with ciprofloxacin mics of > or =4.0 microg/ml and unique sequence variations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes in comparison with the streptococcus pneumoniae r6 strain, were examined. these strains were reidentified using phenotypic methods, including detection of optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination by serotype-specific  antisera, and genotypic methods, including detection of pneumolysin and autolysin genes by pcr, 16s rrna sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the analysis based on concatenated sequences of the six mlst loci distinguished the "atypical" strains from pneumococci, and these strains clustered closely with s.  mitis. however, all these strains and five of nine strains from the viridans streptococcal group possessed one to three gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare genes whose qrdr sequences clustered with those of s. pneumoniae, providing evidence of horizontal transfer of the qrdrs of the gyrase and topoisomerase genes from pneumococci into viridans streptococci. these genes also conferred fluoroquinolone resistance to viridans streptococci. in addition, the fluoroquinolone resistance determinants of 32 well-characterized streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains from bacteremic patients were also compared. these strains have unique amino acid substitutions in gyra and parc that were distinguishable from those in fluoroquinolone-resistant pneumococci and the "atypical" isolates. both recombinational events and de novo mutations play an important role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

AB  == objectives: the role of the viridans group of streptococci (streptococcus oralis) in the prevention of colonization with streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated  in an adenoid organ culture system. methods: the adenoids from 10 patients who were undergoing adenoidectomy for either hypertrophy or recurrent otitis media were used. results: streptococcus oralis parker and s. oralis booth (two organisms isolated from the nasopharynges of patients undergoing adenoidectomy only and patients undergoing adenoidectomy and bilateral tympanostomy with tubes, respectively) uniformly inhibited both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae. although both strains of s. oralis inhibited  the growth of both s. pneumoniae strains, strain parker provided more complete inhibition than did strain booth. conclusions: the results indicate that some strains of s. oralis may inhibit the growth of the most serious pathogens in the  nasopharynx. it is therefore possible that colonization of inhibitory strains of  viridans streptococci may be used in the nasopharynx as a relatively safe and inexpensive approach to prevention of recurrent otitis media in some children and of recurrent suppurative sinusitis in both children and adults.

TI  == distribution and genetic diversity of the abc transporter lipoproteins piua and piaa within streptococcus pneumoniae and related streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the existence of approximately 90 antigenically distinct capsular serotypes has greatly complicated the development of an effective pneumococcal vaccine. virulence-associated proteins common and conserved among all capsular types now represent the best strategy to combat pneumococcal infections. piua and piaa are  the lipoprotein components of two pneumococcal iron abc transporters and are required for full virulence in mouse models of infection. here we describe a study of the distribution and genetic diversity of piua and piaa within typical and atypical s. pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis strains. the genes encoding both piua and piaa were present in all typical pneumococci tested, (covering 20 and 27 serotypes, respectively). the piua gene was highly conserved within the typical pneumococci (0.3% nucleotide divergence), but was also present in "atypical" pneumococci and the closely related species s. mitis and s. oralis, showing up to 10.4% nucleotide divergence and 7.5% amino acid divergence from the typical pneumococcal alleles. conversely, the piaa gene  was found to be specific to typical pneumococci, 100% conserved, and absent from  the oral streptococci, including isolates of s. mitis known to possess pneumolysin and autolysin. these are desirable qualities for a vaccine candidate  and as a diagnostic tool for s. pneumoniae.

AB  == to obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between  human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (b) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. identical erm (b) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. during in vitro mating experiments, the erm (b) gene was exchanged between porcine streptococcus suis and human s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and s. oralis strains. the presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (b) gene. although tet(m) and int tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(o) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). the latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (b) gene from porcine s. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. these results show  that, identical erm (b) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (b) gene from porcine s. suis to human  streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.

TI  == discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from viridans group streptococci by genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  == two oligonucleotide primer sets for the discrimination of streptococcus pneumoniae from "pneumococcus-like" oral streptococcal isolates by pcr were developed. genomic subtractive hybridization was performed to search for differences between streptococcus pneumoniae strain wu2 and the most closely related oral streptococcus, streptococcus mitis strain 903. we identified 19 clones that contained s. pneumoniae-specific nucleotide fragments that were absent from the chromosomal dna of typical laboratory strains of s. mitis and other oral bacteria. subsequently, oligonucleotide pcr primers for the detection  of s. pneumoniae were designed from the sequences of the subtracted dna fragments, and the specificities of the 19 primer sets were evaluated by pcr using chromosomal dnas extracted from four s. pneumoniae clinical isolates and from 20 atypical organisms classified as s. mitis or s. oralis, which harbored genes encoding the pneumococcal virulence factors autolysin (lyta) or pneumolysin (ply), as templates. of the 19 primer sets, two (spn9802 and spn9828) did not amplify pcr products from any of the pneumococcus-like streptococcal strains that we examined. the genes containing the spn9802 and spn9828 sequences encoded proteins of unknown function that did not correspond to any previously described  proteins in other bacteria. these new oligonucleotide primers may be very useful  for early and correct diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infections.

TI  == nana, a neuraminidase from streptococcus pneumoniae, shows high levels of sequence diversity, at least in part through recombination with streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, contains at least two genes, nana and nanb, that express sialidase activity. nana is a virulence determinant of pneumococci which is important in animal models of colonization and middle ear infections. the gene encoding nana was detected in all 106 pneumococcal strains screened that represented 59 restriction profiles. sequencing confirmed a high level of diversity, up to 17.2% at the nucleotide level and 14.8% at the amino acid level. nana diversity is due to a number of mechanisms including insertions, point mutations, and recombination generating mosaic genes. the level of nucleotide divergence for each recombinant block is greater than 30% and much higher than the 20% identified within mosaic pbp genes, suggesting that a high selective pressure exists for these alterations. these data indicate that at least one of the four recombinant blocks identified originated from a streptococcus oralis isolate, demonstrating for the first time  that protein virulence determinants of pneumococci have, as identified previously for genes encoding penicillin binding proteins, evolved by recombination with oral streptococci. no amino acid alterations were identified within the aspartic  boxes or predicted active site, suggesting that sequence variation may be important in evading the adaptive immune response. furthermore, this suggests that nana is an important target of the immune system in the interaction between  the pneumococcus and host.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method targeting the lyta gene for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == it is difficult to separate streptococcus pneumoniae from the genotypically similar species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis, which are commensals of the human oral cavity. a novel nucleic acid amplification technique, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), which amplifies dna under isothermal conditions (63 degrees c) with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity, was examined regarding its applicability for detecting s. pneumoniae. an s. pneumoniae-specific lamp primer targeting the lyta gene was designed. the primer specificity was validated using 10 streptococcus and 7 non-streptococcus species. within 60 min, the assay could detect 10 or more copies of purified s. pneumoniae dna with a sensitivity 1,000 times that of conventional pcr. clinical  isolates of 21 other strains (3 s. oralis, 17 s. mitis, and 1 streptococcus species) that harbor virulence-factor-encoding genes (lyta or ply) were tried to  differentiate s. pneumoniae. the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical isolates  was more selective using the lamp method than using conventional pcr. therefore,  lamp appears to be a sensitive and reliable means of diagnosing s. pneumoniae infection.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

TI  == validation of serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae in europe.
AB  == introduction: serotyping of pneumococci has become increasingly important as new  pneumococcal vaccines are introduced and place emphasis on knowledge of national  serotype-distributions and their development over time. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of serotyping of pneumococci in europe, and to  focus on possible problems with methods, procedures, etc. that may lead to wrong  serotypings. methods: this study was part of a larger eu-project. eleven reference laboratories in europe participated in the validation of pneumococcal serotyping. the streptococcus unit at ssi functioned as the gold standard for use of the neufeld test. each laboratory was asked to type 70 blinded pneumococcal strains by use of their normal serotyping procedure and to answer to a questionnaire regarding their experience and serotyping procedure for pneumococci. the 70 strains were chosen to represent all the 23 pneumococcal types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine plus a number of other less  common types. results: a total of 735 serotypings was performed. five laboratories performed complete serotyping whereas the remaining six laboratories performed partial or variable serotyping into groups or types that did not belong to groups. in general, a high degree of consensus appeared between the 11 european reference laboratories. of 735 serotypings, 39 erroneous serotypings were made (5% of all). most serotyping errors included a wrong serotype within the correct serogroup, where especially types 9n, 18c and 19f were mistyped. furthermore, misidentification of noncapsular pneumococci like s. mitis and s. oralis was also a frequent error. for 22 strains (30%) of pneumococci, serotyping mistakes were made. the erroneous serotypings were neither correlated to the use  of other methods than the neufeld test, nor to the serotyping routine of the laboratories. a number of errors may be due to a serotyping result based on a negative reaction with a specific factor serum, instead of a positive reaction with another factor serum. this may be chosen in order to simplify the serotyping procedure. thus, all the necessary factor sera must be used in order to assure correct serotyping. conclusions: overall, the quality of serotyping of pneumococci was high, and a high degree of consensus was found between the eleven laboratories. it is important to use all the necessary factor sera for serotyping, to perform all the necessary tests and to base a serotyping result always on one or more positive reactions and not on a negative reaction alone. more focus on serotyping of serotypes within groups seems to be warranted.

TI  == characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of tet(m)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == accuracy of phenotypic and genotypic testing for identification of streptococcus  pneumoniae and description of streptococcus pseudopneumoniae sp. nov.
AB  == we have identified an unusual group of viridans group streptococci that resemble  streptococcus pneumoniae. dna-dna homology studies suggested that a subset of these isolates represent a novel species that may be included in the s. oralis-s. mitis group of viridans group streptococci. we suggest that this novel species be termed streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. a combination of phenotypic and genetic reactions allows its identification. s. pseudopneumoniae strains do not have pneumococcal capsules, are resistant to optochin (inhibition zones, less than 14  mm) when they are incubated under an atmosphere of increased co2 but are susceptible to optochin (inhibition zones, >14 mm) when they are incubated in ambient atmospheres, are not soluble in bile, and are positive by the genprobe accuprobe pneumococcus test. the bile solubility test is more specific than the optochin test for identification of s. pneumoniae. genetic tests for pneumolysin  (ply) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (soda) and identification tests with a commercial probe, accuprobe pneumococcus, do not discriminate between the new species and s. pneumoniae.

TI  == autolysin-targeted lightcycler assay including internal process control for detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in clinical samples.
AB  == the development and clinical evaluation of a lightcycler pcr assay, including an  internal process control (ipc), to detect the streptococcus pneumoniae autolysin  gene in clinical samples is reported. the assay was developed to provide a second target for use in conjunction with existing pneumolysin pcr assays to increase the reliability of non-culture pcr diagnosis of pneumococcal infection. primers amplify a 173 bp fragment of the autolysin gene (lyta), which is detected by fluorescence-labelled hybridization probes. an ipc was designed to check for the  presence of pcr inhibitors and loss of assay sensitivity. the ipc product was amplified by the lyta primers and detected by a second set of hybridization probes. the analytical specificity of the autolysin pcr assay was 100% against 39 other bacterial species tested; these included related streptococci and other organisms. the assay, which could reliably detect 50 fg purified pneumococcal dna per reaction, was capable of distinguishing between s. pneumoniae and atypical streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains known to contain the lyta gene. using dna extracts from a panel of edta bloods from patients with blood-culture-confirmed pneumococcal infection, the autolysin pcr had a sensitivity of 42.9%, which was similar to a previously reported taqman pneumolysin pcr (43.8%) run in parallel. total agreement was shown between the autolysin assay and the pneumolysin taqman assay when used to test 23 culture-negative clinical samples, of which eight were positive by pcr, adding valuable clinical information. a specific autolysin-based lightcycler assay has been developed to complement pneumolysin pcr for the detection of s. pneumoniae in clinical samples. this should be a particularly useful tool for the rapid and  sensitive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis, even after an antibiotic has been administered. however, poor sensitivity on blood samples limits its usefulness in other bacteraemic infections.

AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == in vitro activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis compared to those of six other quinolones.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin, a new quinolone, was determined in comparison with other quinolones against different strains of s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci (vgs), and enterococcus faecalis. strains were quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates and quinolone-resistant strains with defined mechanisms of resistance obtained from either clinical isolates or derivatives of s. pneumoniae r6. clinical quinolone-susceptible strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs and e. faecalis  showed garenoxacin mics within a range of 0.03 microg/ml to 0.25 micro g/ml. garenoxacin mics increased two- to eightfold when one mutation was present in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr), fourfold when one mutation was present in the gyra qrdr (s. pneumoniae), 8- to 64-fold when two or three mutations were associated in parc and gyra qrdr, and 2,048-fold when two mutations were present in both the gyra and parc qrdrs (streptococcus pneumoniae). increased active efflux had a moderate effect on garenoxacin mics for s. pneumoniae and vgs. against s. pneumoniae, garenoxacin behaved like moxifloxacin and sparfloxacin, being more affected by a single gyra mutation than by a single parc mutation. although garenoxacin was generally two- to fourfold more active than moxifloxacin against the different wild-type or mutant strains of s. pneumoniae, vgs, and e. faecalis, it was two- to fourfold less active than  gemifloxacin. at four times the respective mic for each strain, the bactericidal  effect of garenoxacin, observed at 6 h for s. pneumoniae and at 24 h for s. oralis and e. faecalis, was not influenced by the presence of mutation either in  the parc or in both the parc and gyra qrdrs.

AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == quantitative detection of moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the recognition of moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. given that the amount of m. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (npss) by real-time pcr may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for  the copb outer membrane protein gene, we detected dna from serial dilutions of m. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same dna was mixed with dna from npss devoid of m. catarrhalis. the specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of dnas from other moraxella species, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, h. influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various neisseria species. the assay applied to  npss from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. the numbers of m. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time pcr correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. this real-time  pcr assay targeting the copb outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of m. catarrhalis in npss; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of m. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or n. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples.

AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == distribution of environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis serotype 2  among s. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == possible overestimation of penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae colonization rates due to misidentification of oropharyngeal streptococci.
AB  == standard identification of streptococcus pneumoniae by optochin and bile solubility testing can lead to ambiguous results for certain isolates. newer bacteriologic identification techniques (e.g., dna probes) now exist. in a prospective point prevalence study of oropharyngeal s. pneumoniae carriage rates  among outpatients, we compared standard organism identification techniques to dna probe testing. by standard identification criteria, 35 (4%) of 872 isolates were  characterized as presumptive s. pneumoniae. thirty of 35 presumptive isolates were recoverable for dna probing; 9 (30%) presumptive isolates were confirmed using a dna probe. the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of these dna probe positive isolates closely paralleled that of clinical blood isolates of s. pneumoniae obtained during the study period. the 21 (70%) dna probe negative isolates, which may represent phylogenetically related species (such as s. mitis  or s. oralis), had significantly reduced antimicrobial susceptibility patterns when compared with the dna probe positive isolates. in colonization studies, if classic criteria (optochin disc zone and bile solubility) are the sole means of identification, s. pneumoniae penicillin resistance rates may be over-reported.

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == low cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42 in patients with acute bacterial meningitis and normalization after treatment.
AB  == csf-a beta 42 may be a marker of alzheimer's disease (ad). a decreased level of csf-a beta 42 is consistently found in ad and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. however, low csf-a beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance creutzfeldt-jakob disease. to examine if the level of a beta 42 in csf is related to inflammatory processes, we studied csf-a beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and  18 age-matched controls. in acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, p<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. after successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the csf-a beta 42 level increased (p<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). the decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing  volumes of serum did not influence the csf-a beta 42 levels. our findings suggest that the reduction in csf-a beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. the cause may be disturbance of the clearance of a beta 42 from the brain.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == identification of the psaa gene, coding for pneumococcal surface adhesin a, in viridans group streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the gene encoding the pneumococcal surface adhesin a (psaa) protein has been identified in three different viridans group streptococcal species. comparative studies of the psaa gene identified in different pneumococcal isolates by sequencing pcr products showed a high degree of conservation among these strains. psaa is encoded by an open reading frame of 930 bp. the analysis of this fragment in streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus anginosus strains revealed a sequence identity of 95, 94, and 90%, respectively, to the corresponding open reading frame of the previously reported streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6b strain. our results confirm that psaa is present and detectable in heterologous bacterial species. the possible implications of these  results for the suitability and potential use of psaa in the identification and diagnosis of pneumococcal diseases are discussed.

TI  == altered protein expression of streptococcus oralis cultured at low ph revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is the predominant aciduric nonmutans streptococcus isolated from the human dentition, but the role of this organism in the initiation and progression of dental caries has yet to be established. to identify proteins that are differentially expressed by s. oralis growing under conditions of low ph, soluble cellular proteins extracted from bacteria grown in batch culture at ph 5.2 or 7.0 were analyzed by two-dimensional (2-d) gel electrophoresis. thirty-nine proteins had altered expression at low ph; these were excised, digested with trypsin using an in-gel protocol, and further analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. the resulting fingerprints were compared with the genomic database  for streptococcus pneumoniae, an organism that is phylogenetically closely related to s. oralis, and putative functions for the majority of these proteins were determined on the basis of functional homology. twenty-eight proteins were up-regulated following growth at ph 5.2; these included enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase), the polypeptide chains comprising atp synthase, and proteins that are considered to play a role in the general stress response of bacteria, including the 60-kda chaperone, hsp33, and superoxide dismutase, and three distinct abc transporters.  these data identify, for the first time, gene products that may be important in the survival and proliferation of nonmutans aciduric s. oralis under conditions of low ph that are likely to be encountered by this organism in vivo.

TI  == tts, a processive beta-glucosyltransferase of streptococcus pneumoniae, directs the synthesis of the branched type 37 capsular polysaccharide in pneumococcus and other gram-positive species.
AB  == the type 37 capsule of streptococcus pneumoniae is a homopolysaccharide built up  from repeating units of [beta-d-glcp-(1-->2)]-beta-d-glcp-(1-->3). the elements governing the expression of the tts gene, coding for the glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the type 37 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, have been studied. primer extension analysis and functional tests demonstrated the presence of four new transcriptional start points upstream of the previously  reported tts promoter (ttsp). most interesting, three of these transcriptional start points are located in a rup element thought to be involved in recombinational events (oggioni, m. r., and claverys, j. p. (1999) microbiology 145, 2647-2653). transformation experiments using either a recombinant plasmid containing the whole transcriptional unit of tts or chromosomal dna from a type 37 pneumococcus showed that tts is the only gene required to drive the biosynthesis of a type 37 capsule in s. pneumoniae and other gram-positive bacteria, namely streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and bacillus subtilis. the tts synthase was overproduced in s. pneumoniae and purified as a membrane-associated enzyme. these membrane preparations used udp-glc as substrate to catalyze the synthesis of a high molecular weight polysaccharide immunologically identical to the type 37 capsule. in addition, udp-gal was also a substrate to produce type 37 polysaccharide since a strong udp-glc-4'-epimerase activity is associated to the membrane fraction of s. pneumoniae. these results indicated that tts has a dual biochemical activity that leads to the synthesis of the branched type 37 polysaccharide.

TI  == mosaic genes and mosaic chromosomes: intra- and interspecies genomic variation of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major causative agent of serious human diseases. the worldwide increase of antibiotic resistant strains revealed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in this pathogen, a scenario that results  in the modulation of the species-specific gene pool. we investigated genomic variation in 20 s. pneumoniae isolates representing major antibiotic-resistant clones and 10 different capsular serotypes. variation was scored as decreased hybridization signals visualized on a high-density oligonucleotide array representing 1,968 genes of the type 4 reference strain knr.7/87. up to 10% of the genes appeared altered between individual isolates and the reference strain;  variability within clones was below 2.1%. ten gene clusters covering 160 kb account for half of the variable genes. most of them are associated with transposases and are assumed to be part of a flexible gene pool within the bacterial population; other variable loci include mosaic genes encoding antibiotic resistance determinants and gene clusters related to bacteriocin production. genomic comparison between s. pneumoniae and commensal streptococcus  mitis and streptococcus oralis strains indicates distinct antigenic profiles and  suggests a smooth transition between these species, supporting the validity of the microarray system as an epidemiological and diagnostic tool.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

AB  == the cell wall of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strain sk137 contains the c-polysaccharide known as the common antigen of a closely related species streptococcus pneumoniae, and a teichoic acid-like polysaccharide with a unique structure. the two polysaccharides are different entities and could be partially  separated by gel chromatography. the structures of the two polysaccharides were determined by chemical methods and by nmr spectroscopy. the teichoic acid-like polymer has a heptasaccharide phosphate repeating unit with the following structure: the structure neither contains ribitol nor glycerol phosphate as classical teichoic acids do, thus we have used the expression teichoic acid-like  for this polysaccharide. the following structure of the c-polysaccharide repeating unit was established: where aat is 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4, 6-trideoxy-d-galactose. it has a carbohydrate backbone identical to that of one of the two structures of c-polysaccharide previously identified in s. pneumoniae. c-polysaccharide of s. mitis is characterized by the presence, in each repeating  unit, of two residues of phosphocholine and both galactosamine residues in the n-acetylated form. immunochemical analysis showed that c-polysaccharide constitutes the lancefield group o antigen. studies using mabs directed against the backbone and against the phosphocholine moiety of the c-polysaccharide revealed several different patterns of these epitopes among 95 s. mitis and streptococcus oralis strains tested and the exclusive presence of the group o antigen in the majority of s. mitis biovar 1 strains.

TI  == genetic relationships between clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mitis: characterization of "atypical" pneumococci and organisms allied to s. mitis harboring s. pneumoniae virulence factor-encoding genes.
AB  == the oral streptococcal group (mitis phylogenetic group) currently consists of nine recognized species, although the group has been traditionally difficult to classify, with frequent changes in nomenclature over the years. the pneumococcus  (streptococcus pneumoniae), an important human pathogen, is traditionally distinguished from the most closely related oral streptococcal species streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis on the basis of three differentiating characteristics: optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, and agglutination with antipneumococcal polysaccharide capsule antibodies. however, there are many reports in the literature of pneumococci lacking one or more of these defining characteristics. sometimes called "atypical" pneumococci, these isolates can be the source of considerable confusion in the clinical laboratory.  little is known to date about the genetic relationships of such organisms with classical s. pneumoniae isolates. here we describe these relationships based on sequence analysis of housekeeping genes in comparison with previously characterized isolates of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis, and s. oralis. while most pneumococci were found to represent a closely related group these studies identified a subgroup of atypical pneumococcal isolates (bile insoluble and/or "acapsular") distinct from, though most closely related to, the "typical" pneumococcal isolates. however, a large proportion of isolates, found to be atypical on the basis of capsule reaction alone, did group with typical pneumococci, suggesting that they have either lost capsule production or represent as-yet-unrecognized capsular types. in contrast to typical s. pneumoniae, isolates phenotypically identified as s. mitis and s. oralis, which included isolates previously characterized in taxonomic studies, were genetically diverse. while most of the s. oralis isolates did fall into a well-separated group, s. mitis isolates did not cluster into a well-separated group. during the  course of these studies we also identified a number of potentially important pathogenic isolates, which were frequently associated with respiratory disease, that phenotypically and genetically are most closely related to s. mitis but which harbor genes encoding the virulence determinants pneumolysin and autolysin  classically associated with s. pneumoniae.

AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

TI  == extensive variation in the ddl gene of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae results from a hitchhiking effect driven by the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene.
AB  == an internal fragment of the ddl gene, encoding the cytoplasmic enzyme d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase, was sequenced from 566 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae and single isolates of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis. the 52 alleles found among the s. pneumoniae isolates fell into two groups. group a alleles were very uniform in sequence and were present in both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. group b alleles were much more diverse and were found only in penicillin-resistant isolates. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis alleles were less diverged from group a alleles than some of the group b pneumococcal alleles, suggesting that the latter alleles contain interspecies recombinational replacements. the ddl gene was located 783 bp downstream of the penicillin-binding protein 2b gene (pbp2b). sequencing of the pbp2b-recr-ddl-murf region of three penicillin-resistant pneumococci that had diverged ddl alleles showed that the whole region from pbp2b to ddl (or beyond) was highly diverged (about 8%) compared with the sequences from three penicillin-susceptible isolates. the high  levels of diversity in the group b ddl alleles from penicillin-resistant isolates were ascribed to a hitchhiking effect whereby interspecies recombinational exchanges at pbp2b, selected by penicillin usage, often extend into, or through,  the ddl gene. the data allow the average size of the interspecies recombinational replacements to be estimated at about 6 kb.

AB  == the usefulness and reliability of partial sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda), autolysin (lyta) gene amplification and species-specific pcr based on the d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (ddl) gene for differentiating each member of the mitis group of the genus streptococcus was investigated. on the phylogenetic tree based on soda partial sequences (366 bp) from 96 strains, including all species currently within the mitis group isolated in different geographic areas (mainly japan and the uk), eight well separated clusters were generated corresponding to recognized species, and all strains fell into those clusters to which they had also been assigned by  dna-dna hybridization. the streptococcus pneumoniae sub-cluster was located within the streptococcus mitis cluster, but the soda gene of s. pneumoniae was very conserved and therefore could be separated from all other species examined.  furthermore, the lyta gene amplification approach could also be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from other species. the species-specific amplification product of the ddl gene was successfully detected in streptococcus  sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, but failed to be detected in some strains of streptococcus oralis including the type strain and s. mitis. we conclude that  the partial sequence analysis of the soda gene could be applied globally as a reliable and easy method for the accurate identification of all species currently within the mitis group.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == in vitro exchange of fluoroquinolone resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci and genomic organization of the pare-parc region in s. mitis.
AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == genetic diversity of the streptococcal competence (com) gene locus.
AB  == the com operon of naturally transformable streptococcal species contains three genes, comc, comd, and come, involved in the regulation of competence. the comc gene encodes a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) thought to induce competence  in the bacterial population at a critical extracellular concentration. the comd and come genes are believed to encode the transmembrane histidine kinase and response regulator proteins, respectively, of a two-component regulator, with the comd-encoded protein being a receptor for csp. here we report on the genetic variability of comc and comd within streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. comparative analysis of sequence variations of comc and comd shows that, despite  evidence for horizontal gene transfer at this locus and the lack of transformability of many s. pneumoniae strains in the laboratory, there is a clear correlation between the presence of a particular comc allele and the cognate comd allele. these findings effectively rule out the possibility that the presence of noncognate comc and comd alleles may be responsible for the inability to induce competence in many isolates and indicate the importance of a functional com pathway in these isolates. in addition, we describe a number of novel csps from disease-associated strains of s. mitis and s. oralis. the csps from these isolates are much more closely related to those from s. pneumoniae than to most csps previously reported from s. mitis and s. oralis, suggesting that these particular organisms may be a potential source of dna in recombination events generating the mosaic structures commonly reported in genes of s. pneumoniae that are under strong selective pressure.

TI  == fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in the parc, pare, and gyra genes of clinical isolates of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs)  of the parc and gyra genes from seven ciprofloxacin-resistant (cpr) isolates of viridans group streptococci (two high-level cpr streptococcus oralis and five low-level cpr streptococcus mitis isolates) were determined and compared with those obtained from susceptible isolates. the nucleotide sequences of the qrdrs of the pare and gyrb genes from the five low-level cpr s. mitis isolates and from the nctc 12261 type strain were also analyzed. four of these low-level cpr isolates had changes affecting the subunits of dna topoisomerase iv: three in ser-79 (to phe or ile) of parc and one in pare at a position not previously described to be involved in quinolone resistance (pro-424). one isolate did not show any mutation. the two high-level cpr s. oralis isolates showed mutations affecting equivalent residue positions of parc and gyra, namely, ser-79 to phe and ser-81 to phe or tyr, respectively. the parc mutations were able to transform streptococcus pneumoniae to ciprofloxacin resistance, while the gyra mutations transformed s. pneumoniae only when mutations in parc were present. these results suggest that dna topoisomerase iv is a primary target of ciprofloxacin in viridans group streptococci, dna gyrase being a secondary target.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == a global gene pool for high-level cephalosporin resistance in commensal streptococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == highly penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis were isolated in spain, hungary, and berlin. with chromosomal dna of these strains, resistant transformants of streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained that expressed low-affinity variants of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) 2x, 1a, 2a, and 2b in different combinations,  depending on the selective conditions. the transformants had cefotaxime mics of up to 6 microg/ml, and those with a low-affinity pbp 2b were highly deficient in  penicillin-induced lysis. sequence analysis of the pbp2x genes confirmed the presence of a global gene pool of penicillin resistance determinants shared by commensal and pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == molecular bases of three characteristic phenotypes of pneumococcus: optochin-sensitivity, coumarin-sensitivity, and quinolone-resistance.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is uniquely sensitive to amino alcohol antimalarials in  the erythro configuration, such as optochin, quinine, and quinidine. the protein  responsible for the optochin (quinine)-sensitive (opts, qins) phenotype of pneumococcus is the proteolipid c subunit of the fzerof1 h(+)-atpase. optr/qinr isolates arose by point mutations in the atpc gene and produce different amino acid changes in one of the two transmembrane alpha-helices of the c subunit. in addition, comparison of the sequence of the atpcab genes of s. pneumoniae r6 (opts) and m222 (an optr strain produced by interspecies recombination between pneumococcus and s. oralis), and s. oralis (optr) revealed that, in m222, an interchange of atpc and atpa had occurred. we also demonstrate that optochin, quinine, and related compounds specifically inhibited the membrane-bound atpase activity. equivalent differences between opts/qins and optr/qinr strains, both in growth inhibition and in membrane atpase resistance, were found. pneumococci also show a characteristic sensitivity to coumarin drugs, and a relatively high level  of resistance to most quinolones. we have cloned and sequenced the gyrb gene, and characterized novobiocin resistant mutants. the same amino acid substitution (ser-127 to leu) confers novobiocin resistance on four isolates. this residue position is equivalent to val-120 of escherichia coli rygb, a residue that lies inside the atp-binding domain but is not involved in novobiocin binding in e. coli, as revealed by crystallographic data. in addition, the genes encoding the parc and pare subunits of topoisomerase iv, together with the region encoding amino acids 46 to 172 (residue numbers as in e. coli) of the pneumococcal ryga subunit, were characterized in respect to fluoroquinolone resistance. the gyra gene maps to a physical location distant from the gyrb and parec loci on the chromosome. ciprofloxacin-resistant (cpr) clinical isolates had mutations affecting amino acid residues of the quinolone resistance-determining region of parc (low-level cpr), or in both resistance-determining regions of parc and gyra  (high-level cpr). mutations were found in residue positions equivalent to ser-83  and asp-87 of the e. coli gyra subunit. transformation experiments demonstrated that topoisomerase iv is the primary target of ciprofloxacin, dna gyrase being a  secondary one.

TI  == identification and characterization of is1381, a new insertion sequence in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a new insertion sequence (is1381) was identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae r6 as an 846-bp segment containing 20-bp terminal inverted repeats and flanked by 7-bp direct repeats. the three sequenced copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame (orf) genes named orfa and orfb. however, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that inactivating mutations have occurred in an original single orf. accordingly, the  consensus is1381 element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single orf sufficient to encode a basic protein of 267 amino acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative transposases of isl2  from lactobacillus helveticus and of is702 from the cyanobacterium calothrix sp.  strain pcc 7601. a minimum of five to seven copies were detected by hybridization experiments in the r6 genome. in remarkable contrast with the two previously reported pneumococcal insertion sequences, several copies of is1381 have been detected in all of the clinical isolates tested so far. interestingly, streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a close relative of pneumococcus,  does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of streptococcus mitis (nctc 12261) suggests that this species has exchanged dna with s. pneumoniae directly or through an intermediate species.

TI  == autolysis and cell wall degradation in a choline-independent strain of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae has an auxotrophic requirement for choline, and choline  residues that incorporate into the wall and membrane teichoic acids are intimately involved with the control of autolytic phenomena of this bacterium. we report here the re-examination of the role of choline in autolytic cell wall degradation using the choline-independent s. pneumoniae strain r6cho- recovered from a heterologous cross with dna from streptococcus oralis. s pneumoniae cho- cultured in choline-free medium grew with normal generation time but formed long  chains, failed to undergo stationary-phase autolysis, and was also resistant to lysis induced by deoxycholate or penicillin. cell walls produced under these conditions had reduced phosphorus content, contained no choline residues detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, and had reduced binding capacity for the pneumococcal autolytic amidase, and complete hydrolysis of such walls by the  amidase required prolonged incubation with high concentrations of the enzyme. addition of choline to the growth medium reversed at these phenomena. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of amidase digests of cell walls  prepared from strain r6cho- grown with or without choline produced identical stem peptide profiles, which were also similar to that of the parental s. pneumoniae strain r6. peptidoglycans prepared by hydrofluoric extraction of cell walls from  cho- growth with or without choline or from the parental strain r6 were uniformly susceptible to the autolytic amidase and were fully degraded to the normal family of stem peptides, indicating that, in sharp contrast to the case of cell walls, the amidase degradation of teichoic acid-free peptidoglycan did not require the presence of choline residues in the substrate.

TI  == occurrence of lipoteichoic acid in oral streptococci.
AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2b similarities among streptococcus mitis, s. oralis, and s. pneumoniae using dna fingerprinting and sequencing were investigated. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed on 41 penicillin-susceptible and -resistant clinical isolates of s. mitis and s. oralis using the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 pbp 2b primers. pcr products were then analyzed using hinf i and sty i restriction enzymes. of 41 s. mitis/s. oralis isolates studied 15 strains produced a pcr product of a similar size to that of s. pneumoniae r6. on fingerprinting these 15 strains, 11 different patterns were  seen using sty i restriction enzyme and 12 different patterns with hinf i. the pbp 2b genes of the s. mitis and s. oralis isolates studied were found to be very heterogenous. the pbp 2b genes of two s. mitis isolates, mics 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, were sequenced. these pbp 2b genes were found to possess a mosaic  structure when compared to those of other s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococcal species. analysis of these mosaic blocks indicates that both s. mitis strains contain areas that originated from s. pneumoniae as well as regions of unknown origin. pbp 2b sequence comparisons of a susceptible s. oralis with reported sequences of s. pneumoniae r6 and s. mitis nctc 10712 revealed what appears at this stage to be nucleotide regions unique to s. oralis. a penicillin-resistant s. oralis strain contained a pneumococcal region of 272 bp that was flanked by s. oralis sequences. these specific s. oralis regions have been located in pbp 2b genes of penicillin-resistant s. oralis and s. pneumoniae  isolates described from europe and south africa.

TI  == mosaic pbpx genes of major clones of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved from pbpx genes of a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis.
AB  == penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae contain mosaic penicillin-binding protein (pbp) genes that encode pbps with decreased affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. the mosaic blocks are believed to be the result of gene transfer of homologous pbp genes from related penicillin-resistant species.  we have now identified a gene homologous to the pneumococcal pbp2x gene (pbpx) in a penicillin-sensitive streptococcus oralis isolate m3 from south africa that diverged by almost 20% from pbpx of penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, and a central sequence block of a mosaic pbpx gene of streptococcus mitis strain nctc 10712. in contrast, it differed by only 2-4% of the 1 to 1.5 kb mosaic block in pbpx genes of three genetically unrelated penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates, two of them representing clones of serotype 6b and 23f, which are prevalent in spain and are also already found in other countries. with low concentrations of cefotaxime, transformants of the sensitive s. pneumoniae r6 strain could be selected containing pbpx genes from either s. mitis nctc 10712 or s. oralis m3, demonstrating that genetic exchange can already occur between beta-lactam-sensitive species. these data are in agreement with the assumption that pbps as penicillin-resistance determinants have evolved by the accumulation  of point mutations in genes of sensitive commensal species.

AB  == the gene responsible for the optochin-sensitive (opts) phenotype of streptococcus pneumoniae has been characterized. sequence comparisons indicated that the genes  involved encoded the subunits of the f0 complex of an h(+)-atpase. sequence analysis and transformation experiments showed that the atpc gene is responsible  for the optochin-sensitive resistant (opts/optr) phenotype. our results also show that natural as well as laboratory optr isolates have arisen by point mutations that produce different amino acid changes at positions 48, 49 or 50 of the atpase c subunit. the nucleotide sequence of the f0 complex of the streptococcus oralis  atpase has also been determined. in addition, comparison of the sequence of the atpcab genes of s. pneumoniae r6 (opts) and m222 (an optr strain produced by interspecies recombination between pneumococcus and s. oralis), and s. oralis revealed that, in m222, an interchange of atpc and atpa had occurred. we also demonstrate that optochin specifically inhibited the membrane-bound atpase activity of the s. pneumoniae wild-type (opts) strains, and found a 100-fold difference between opts and optr strains, both in growth inhibition and in membrane atpase resistance.

AB  == mutations that cause a block in a late step of the protoheme ix biosynthetic pathway, i.e., in a step after uroporphyrinogen iii, map at 94 degrees on the bacillus subtilis chromosomal genetic map. we have cloned and sequenced the hem genes at this location. the sequenced region contains six open reading frames: pona, heme, hemh, hemy, orfa, and orfb. the pona gene product shows over 30% sequence identity to penicillin-binding proteins 1a of escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus oralis and probably has a role in cell wall metabolism. the heme gene was identified from amino acid sequence comparisons as encoding uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase. the hemh gene was identified by enzyme activity analysis of the hemh protein expressed in e. coli.  it encodes a water-soluble ferrochelatase which catalyzes the final step in protoheme ix synthesis, the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin ix. the function of the hemy gene product was not elucidated, but mutation analysis shows that it is required for a late step in protoheme ix synthesis. the hemy gene probably encodes an enzyme with coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase or protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase activity or both of these activities. inactivation  of the orfa and orfb genes did not block protoheme ix synthesis. preliminary evidence for a hemehy mrna was obtained, and a promoter region located in front of heme was identified. from these combined results we conclude that the hemehy gene cluster encodes enzymes for the synthesis of protoheme ix from uroporphyrinogen iii and probably constitutes an operon.

AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with decreased affinity for penicillin. the pbp2b genes of these strains have a mosaic structure, consisting of regions that  are very similar to those in penicillin-sensitive strains, alternating with regions that are highly diverged. penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., s. sanguis and s. oralis) that produce altered pbps have also been reported. the pbp2b genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of s. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class b pbp2b genes found in  penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of s. pneumoniae. emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered pbp2b gene from penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae into s. sanguis. the pbp2b genes of three penicillin-resistant s. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class b pbp2b gene of penicillin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence. penicillin resistance in s. oralis has also probably arisen by horizontal transfer of this variant form of the class b mosaic pbp2b gene from a penicillin-resistant strain of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == identification of atypical strains of streptococcus pneumoniae by a specific dna  probe.
AB  == a specific dna probe containing a 0.65 kb fragment coding for the aminoterminal region of the major pneumococcal autolysin (amidase) was constructed, deleting the region involved in the specific recognition of cell wall choline residues. the high specificity of this probe was demonstrated in tests with streptococcus pneumoniae related species including streptococcus oralis, which contains choline in its cell wall. the probe was used to characterize pneumococcal isolates showing atypical responses in conventional identification tests. the hybridization obtained with 27 atypical pneumococci and 11 of 17 isolates presumptively identified as viridans streptococci confirmed that the probe is suitable for diagnostic use.

TI  == microbiological flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis with particular reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in a microbiological study of the urethral flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis (ngu), chlamydia trachomatis (isolated from 30% of men) was the only organism isolated significantly more often from men with ngu than controls (p less than 0.01). bacteroids species, especially of the melaninogenicus-oralis group, were the predominant anaerobic bacterial isolate from both men with ngu (isolated from 24%) and controls (isolated from 30%). there was no evidence that  aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria or herpes simplex virus made a significant contribution as primary pathogens in non-chlamydial ngu. gram-positive cocci were the only anaerobic organism isolated more often from chlamydia-positive men (29%) than chlamydia-negative men (16%) with ngu (p less than 0.01). the significance of this remains unclear.

TI  == infection of streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 by pneumococcal phages.
AB  == we have found a group of pneumococcal bacteriophages (cp-1, cp-7) that can successfully infect and replicate in streptococcus oralis, whereas dp-1 was unable to infect this species. we have also developed conditions that allowed transfection of s. oralis using dp-1 dna. our results support the direct involvement of the phage-coded lysins in the liberation of the phage progeny from infected s. oralis cells. since s. oralis and s. pneumoniae are bacteria that share the same ecological niche in humans, the availability of the system described here should allow to extend our current studies on the modular organization of the lytic enzymes and might serve as a tool to study the evolutionary relationships between host and parasite.

TI  == characterization of genetic transformation in streptococcus oralis nctc 11427: expression of the pneumococcal amidase in s. oralis using a new shuttle vector.
AB  == we have worked out conditions for the study of competence development and genetic transformation in streptococcus oralis nctc 11427 (type strain), a species that contains choline in the cell wall. the peak of competence was found at the early  exponential phase of growth and the optimal conditions for transformation were achieved with shuttle plasmids prepared from s. pneumoniae or from escherichia coli serving as donor dna. transformation with dye-buoyant density gradient purified plasmid preparations followed first-order kinetics. the pneumococcal amidase can be expressed in s. oralis harbouring a plasmid carrying the lyta gene. this enzyme lysed the cell wall of the transformed cell in the presence of  detergents.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  == adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (group a) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (group b). patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. the adenoids  were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. there were 97 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates in both groups were: bacteroides sp. (including b. melaninogenicus and b. oralis), fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and veillonella sp. there were 138 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (group a, b, c, and f), s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and hemophilus sp. hemophilus influenzae type b, and s. aureus were more frequently isolated in group a. b. fragilis was only recovered in group a. beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. fifteen of these patients belonged to group a (83% of group a), while 3 were members of group b (25% of group b). these bacteria were all isolates of s. aureus (11) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 b. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 b. oralis, and two of 8 h. influenza type b. our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.

TI  == bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
