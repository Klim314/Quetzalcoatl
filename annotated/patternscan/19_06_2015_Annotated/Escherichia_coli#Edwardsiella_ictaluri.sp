TI  == molecular cloning and functional characterization of cyclophilin a in yellow catfish (pelteobagrus fulvidraco).
AB  == cyclophilin a (cypa) is a ubiquitously expressed protein which involves in diverse pathological conditions including infection and inflammation. in this report, a cypa gene (designated as yc-cypa) was cloned from yellow catfish (pelteobagrus fulvidraco) which is an important cultured fish species in asian countries. the open reading frame (orf) of yc-cypa encoded a polypeptide of 164 amino acids with calculated molecular weight of 17.70 kda. the deduced amino acid sequences of the yc-cypa shared highly conserved structures with cypas from the other species, indicating that yc-cypa should be a new member of the cypa family. full-length yc-cypa protein was expressed in escherichia coli and specific polyclonal antibody against yc-cypa was generated. the yc-cypa protein showed chemotactic activity by transwell migration assay. the mrna and protein of yc-cypa could be detected in all examined tissues with relatively higher mrna level in spleen and higher protein level in head kidney, respectively. the temporal expression patterns of yc-cypa, il-1beta and tnf-alpha mrnas were analyzed in the liver, spleen and head kidney post of edwardsiella ictaluri infection. by immunohistochemistry assay, slight enhancement of yc-cypa protein was observed in the liver, spleen, body kidney and head kidney of yellow catfish  infected with e. ictaluri. in conclusion, yc-cypa of yellow catfish showed chemotactic activity in vitro and might have been involved in cytokines secretion in yellow catfish during the infection of e. ictaluri.

TI  == vaccine efficacy of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) from edwardsiella ictaluri against e. tarda in tilapia.
AB  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), derived from the outer-membrane protein (omp) fraction, has been used as a potential candidate for vaccine development. the gene-encoding 37 kda gapdh outer membrane protein (omp) from edwardsiella ictaluri was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), western blotting, and nucleotide and amino acid sequencing were used to analyze the expressed antigenic protein and gene encoding this protein. comparative dna and protein sequence analysis of  gapdh from e. ictaluri gapdhs from several gram-negative bacterial species within the enterobacteriaceae family revealed that the gapdhs within this group are highly conserved and share a sequence similarity of 75-100% with e. ictaluri gdpdh. rabbit antiserum raised against the e. ictaluri recombinant gapdh (rgapdh) protein recognized purified gadph, indicating that it has a strong immunogenicity. tilapia fish were intraperitoneally immunized with formalin-killed e. ictaluri whole cells, and rgapdh (30 mug fish(-1)) from e. ictaluri, both of which were emulsified in isa 763a adjuvant. at 3 months after immunization, fish were challenged with the e. tarda strain to assess vaccine efficacy; the relative percent survival (rps) values were found to exceed 71.4%.  the specific mean antibody titer log2 level of groups vaccinated with rgapdh at 3 months was significantly higher than that of non-vaccinated fish (control group). therefore, this recombinant protein can be considered a multi-purpose candidate vaccine against several pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == in vivo effects of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide on regulation of immune response and protein expression in striped catfish (pangasianodon hypophthalmus).
AB  == lipolysaccharide (lps), a component of outer membrane protein of gram-negative bacteria, reportedly stimulates fish immune system. however, mechanisms driving this immunomodulatory effect are yet unknown. to determine effects of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide on regulation of immune response and protein expression of striped catfish (pangasianodon hypophthalmus), juvenile fish (20-25 g) were injected with 3, 15 or 45 mg e.coli lps/kg and challenged with edwardsiella ictaluri. plasma cortisol and glucose were rather low and did not differ (p<0.05) among treatments. all lps treatments differed regarding blood cell count and immune variables such as plasma and spleen lysozyme, complement activity and antibody titer, 3mg lps/kg yielding best results; red blood cell count was not affected by lps treatment. accumulated mortalities after bacterial challenge were 23.4, 32.8, 37.7 and 52.5% for treatment 3, 15, 45 mg lps/kg fish and control respectively. proteomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) confirmed that lps induced differentially over-expressed immune proteins such as  complement component c3 and lysozyme c2 precursor. regulation of other proteins such as wap65, alpha-2 macroglobulin-3 and transferrin precursor was also demonstrated. striped catfish injected with e.coli lps enhanced innate immune responses.

TI  == a new zebrafish model of oro-intestinal pathogen colonization reveals a key role  for adhesion in protection by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial contribution of commensal bacteria to host health and homeostasis  led to the concept that exogenous non-pathogenic bacteria called probiotics could be used to limit disease caused by pathogens. however, despite recent progress using gnotobiotic mammal and invertebrate models, mechanisms underlying protection afforded by commensal and probiotic bacteria against pathogens remain  poorly understood. here we developed a zebrafish model of controlled co-infection in which germ-free zebrafish raised on axenic living protozoa enabled the study of interactions between host and commensal and pathogenic bacteria. we screened enteric fish pathogens and identified edwardsiella ictaluri as a virulent strain  inducing a strong inflammatory response and rapid mortality in zebrafish larvae infected by the natural oro-intestinal route. using mortality induced by infection as a phenotypic read-out, we pre-colonized zebrafish larvae with 37 potential probiotic bacterial strains and screened for survival upon e. ictaluri  infection. we identified 3 robustly protective strains, including vibrio parahaemolyticus and 2 escherichia coli strains. we showed that the observed protective effect of e. coli was not correlated with a reduced host inflammatory  response, nor with the release of biocidal molecules by protective bacteria, but  rather with the presence of specific adhesion factors such as f pili that promote the emergence of probiotic bacteria in zebrafish larvae. our study therefore provides new insights into the molecular events underlying the probiotic effect and constitutes a potentially high-throughput in vivo approach to the study of the molecular basis of pathogen exclusion in a relevant model of vertebrate oro-intestinal infection.

TI  == edwardsiella ictaluri luxs: activity, expression, and involvement in pathogenicity.
AB  == edwardsiella ictaluri is a gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of enteric septicemia of catfish. in this study, we examined the expression and function of the luxs from a pathogenic e. ictaluri strain, 1901. j901 was found to produce autoinducer 2 (ai-2) activity that maximized at mid-logarithmic phase  and was enhanced by glucose and repressed by high temperature. consistently, a luxs gene (luxsei) was identified in j901, whose expression was regulated by cell density, glucose, and temperature in a manner similar to that observed with ai-2  activity. further analysis showed that luxsei is a biologically active ai-2 synthase that was able to complement the luxs-defective phenotype of escherichia  coli dh5alpha. to examine the functional importance of luxsei, a genetically modified variant of j901, j901ri, was constructed, in which luxsei, expression was blocked by rna interference. compared to the wild type, j901ri was (i) reduced in ai-2 activity to a level of 59% of that of the wild type; (ii) impaired in both planktonic and biofilm growth; (iii) significantly attenuated in the ability to infect cultured fish cells and to cause mortality in infected fish; (iv) unable to induce the expression of certain virulence-associated genes. addition of exogenous ai-2 failed to rescue the growth defect of j901ri as free-living cells but restored biofilm production and the expression of virulence genes to levels comparable to those of the wild type. taken together, these results indicate that luxsei is a functional ai-2 synthase that is required for optimal cellular growth and host infection.

TI  == isolation and characterization of sap and crp, two pentraxins from pangasianodon  (pangasius) hypophthalmus.
AB  == from the serum of pangasianodon hypophthalmus, two proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography on sepharose and phosphorylcholine-sepharose. their binding on the affinity matrices critically depends on the presence of ca2+ ions. n-terminal sequencing and sequencing of internal tryptic peptides identified the  proteins as pentraxins and from their binding properties they are identified as sap (serum amyloid p component) and crp (c-reactive protein). per ml serum, 36 microg sap and 56 microg crp was purified. upon gel filtration, both the sap and  crp elute as trimers of respectively 24 kda and 28 kda subunits. both proteins are devoid of inter-chain disulfide bonds. both sap and crp are glycosylated and  agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes and pathogenic bacteria edwardsiella ictaluri and aeromonas hydrophila, but not micrococcus lysodeikticus or escherichia coli. haemagglutination of sap and crp is inhibited by galactose (mic = 1 mm) and by phosphorylcholine (mic = 1-2 mm), respectively. circular dichroism studies revealed that antiparallel beta-pleated sheets are dominating the secondary structure. upon removing the ca(2+) ions by edta, slight structural changes are observed by cd spectroscopy in the near-uv region. immunodiffusion shows that p.  hypophthalmus sap and crp do not cross-react.

TI  == role of nonspecific cytotoxic cells in bacterial resistance: expression of a novel pattern recognition receptor with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == pattern recognition receptors (prr) recognize invariant bacterial, viral, protozoan and certain synthetic ligands. prr may be expressed as outer membrane (or endosomal) or cytosolic proteins and function to signal cell activation processes during inflammation responses. in the present study, a novel membrane receptor, ncc cationic antimicrobial protein-1 (ncamp-1), is described that is expressed on nonspecific cytotoxic cell (ncc) membranes and is found in granule extracts from these cells. in recombinant form, full-length (amino acids 1-203) and truncated n (nt; amino acids 1-60) and c (ct; amino acids 116-203) terminal forms of ncamp-1 had antibacterial activity against bovine, avian and lab strain  escherichia coli. recombinant ncamp-1-nt also killed the gram-negative fish pathogen edwardsiella ictaluri. maximal bacterial killing of a representative avian e. coli, apec 3721, occurred at 60min post-treatment with 2microg/ml of rncamp-1-nt. killing occurred by ncamp-1-nt-induced alterations in the permeability of the bacterial cell wall. polyclonal antibody anti-ncamp-1 specifically neutralized the antimicrobial activity of recombinant ncamp-1-nt against e. coli apec 3751. expression of ncamp-1 as a ncc membrane protein was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-ncamp-1 monoclonal antibody 9c9. merged images from immunofluorescence microscopy showed that ncamp-1 and the ncc receptor protein (nccrp-1) are co-expressed on ncc membranes. ncamp-1 was identified in acetic acid granule extracts of ncc by western blot analysis using  polyclonal anti-ncamp-1 and killing of e. coli by these extracts was specifically inhibited by this polyclonal. these data suggested that ncamp-1 is a membrane protein and may participate in antibacterial innate immunity by granule exocytosis during inflammatory responses in teleosts.

TI  == a thermostable variant of fructose bisphosphate aldolase constructed by directed  evolution also shows increased stability in organic solvents.
AB  == thermostable variants of the class ii fructose bisphosphate aldolase have been isolated following four rounds of directed evolution using dna shuffling of the fda genes from escherichia coli and edwardsiella ictaluri. variants from all four generations of evolution have been purified and characterized. the variants show  increased thermostability with no loss of catalytic function at room temperature. the temperature at which 50% of the initial enzyme activity is lost after incubation for 10 min (t50) of the most stable variant, 4-43d6, is increased by 11-12 degrees c over the wild-type enzymes and the half-life of activity at 53 degrees c is increased approximately 190-fold. in addition, variant 4-43d6 shows  increased stability to treatment with organic solvents. dna sequencing of the evolved variants has identified the mutations which have been introduced and which lead to increased thermostability, and the role of the mutations introduced is discussed.

TI  == purification of antimicrobial factor from granules of channel catfish peripheral  blood leucocytes.
AB  == the channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) is extensively used in aquaculture in the southeast us and is susceptible to many bacterial infections acquired from its pond environment. research is needed to better understand the defensive response and innate immunity of channel catfish against fish pathogens like edwardsiella ictaluri and aeromonas hydrophila. the main objectives were purification and characterization of an innate antimicrobial factor isolated from catfish leucocytes that has both bactericidal and antiviral activities. oxygen-independent mechanisms of innate immunity for killing microorganisms have  not been identified in leucocytes of channel catfish. leucocytes were separated from catfish blood, and granule extracts were obtained by homogenization, centrifugation, and extraction with 10% acetic acid. the granule extracts were further purified by gel filtration chromatography. bactericidal assays against the two fish pathogens and sds-page analysis were done on the isolated antimicrobial factor. determination of antiviral activity of the factor was done  by in vitro tissue culture using herpes simplex virus-type 1. mass spectrometry analyses were done for molecular weight (655 da), purity, and structural characterization of the innate non-peptide antimicrobial factor.

TI  == cloning and characterization of edwardsiella ictaluri proteins expressed and recognized by the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus immune response during infection.
AB  == an edwardsiella ictaluri expression library was screened for clones expressing antigenic e. ictaluri proteins using anti-e. ictaluri serum, which resulted in the isolation of 32 clones. the clones were partially characterized and 4 were selected for complete analysis. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), 2-dimensional page, western blotting, and dna sequencing were used to analyze expressed antigenic proteins and encoded genes. sequence analysis identified 4 putative open reading frames (orfs) in the insert  of clone 4d6, which corresponded to antigenic acidic proteins of 55, 20 and 18 kda expressed by both the clone and e. ictaluri cells. the predicted gene products of these orfs were similar to several products of the imp locus of rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii. the imp locus of r. leguminosarum contains  14 genes that encode proteins involved in a putative temperature-dependent protein secretion system. in addition there was significant amino acid identity for a variety of hypothetical proteins from r. solanacearum, ps. aeruginosa, a. tumefaciens, y. pestis, and salmonella typhimurium. overlapping inserts of clones 1.4, 5d2, and 5d3 encoded orfs similar to escherichia coli partial genes sera and pgk, and complete genes rpia, icia, ygge, yggb and fda. these genes encode d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (sera), ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (rpia), a specific inhibitor of chromosomal initiation of replication (icia), a hypothetical protein (ygge), a protein involved in responses to osmotic stress (yggb), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fda), and phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk). cloned antigenic e. ictaluri proteins of 33, 27, 35 and 45 kda appeared to be products of the orfs similar to ygge, rpia, icia, and fda respectively. all the cloned antigenic proteins were recognized by antiserum from catfish that had  recovered from enteric septicemia of catfish (esc), indicating that these antigens are expressed during the infectious process. the cloned antigenic proteins were subsequently evaluated as subunit vaccines for protection against wild-type e. ictaluri. all vaccine treatments were protective against e. ictaluri in catfish, but results were inconclusive due to high levels of cross-reactive protection afforded by the e. coli host strain of the cloning vector.

TI  == edwardsiella ictaluri invasion of iec-6, henle 407, fathead minnow and channel catfish enteric epithelial cells.
AB  == invasion of edwardsiella ictaluri into cultured mammalian, fish and enzymatically harvested catfish enteric epithelial cells is described. gentamicin survival assays were used to demonstrate the ability of this catfish pathogen to invade iec-6 (origin: rat small intestinal epithelium), henle 407 (origin: human embryonic intestinal epithelium), fathead minnow (fhm, minnow epithelial cells) and trypsin/pepsin-harvested channel catfish enteric epithelial cells. invasion of all cell types occurred within 2 h of contact at 26 degrees c, in contrast to  escherichia coli dh5 alpha, which did not invade cells tested. eight edwardsiella ictaluri isolates from diseased catfish and the atcc (american type culture collection) strain were evaluated for invasion efficiency using fhm cells. all isolates were invasive, but at differing efficiencies. invasion blocking assays using chemical blocking agents were performed on a single isolate (la 89-9) using iec-6 epithelial cells. preincubation of iec-6 cells with cytochalasin d (microfilament depolymerizer) and monodansylcadaverine (blocks receptor-mediated  endocytosis) significantly reduced invasion by e. ictaluri, whereas exposure to colchicine (microtubule depolymerizer) had no effect on bacterial internalization. results indicate that actin polymerization and receptor-mediated endocytosis are involved in uptake of e. ictaluri by iec-6 epithelial cells. invasion trials using freshly harvested cells from the intestine of the natural host, ictalurus punctatus, show that invasion occurs, but at a low efficiency. this is possibly due to loss of outer membrane receptors during enzymatic cell harvest. this study provides the first documentation of the invasion of cultured  mammalian and fish cells by e. ictaluri, and identifies possible mechanisms used  for intracellular access. additionally, the study describes several functional in vitro invasion models using commercially available cell lines as well as cells from the natural host (channel catfish, i. punctatus).

TI  == rapid detection of columnaris disease in channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) with a new species-specific 16-s rrna gene-based pcr primer for flavobacterium columnare.
AB  == a 16-s rrna gene from the chromosomal dna of the fish-pathogenic bacterium flavobacterium columnare (formerly flexibacter columnaris), strain ars-i, was cloned, sequenced and used to design a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set. the primer set amplified a specific 1193-bp dna fragment from f. columnare strains but not from related bacteria, f. psychrophilum, f. aquatile, f. branchiophilum, or other bacterial pathogens of fish, flexibacter maritimus, cytophaga johnsonae, edwardsiella ictaluri, e. tarda, aeromonas hydrophila, and streptococcus iniae or from the non-fish pathogen escherichia coli. the pcr reaction conditions were optimized to permit detection of the organism from agar  plates, broth culture, frozen samples, dead fish tissue, and live fish in less than 5 h (8 h, if the more sensitive nested pcr is used). dna was extracted by a  boiled-extraction method or by commercial column purification. the pcr product was detected at dna concentrations below 0.1 ng and from as few as 100 bacterial  cells. nested pcr using universal eubacterial primers increased the sensitivity five-fold, allowing detection of f. columnare strains at dna concentrations below 0.05 ng and from as few as 10 bacterial cells in apparently healthy, asymptomatic fish. the efficiency of this primer set was compared to the 16-s rrna gene primer sets of toyama et al. [fish pathol. 29 (1994) 271.] and that of bader and shotts  [j. aquat. anim. health 10 (1998) 311.]. the new primer set is as good or better  than the previously published primer sets for detecting f. columnare in all samples and under all conditions tested.

TI  == attenuation, persistence, and vaccine potential of an edwardsiella ictaluri pura  mutant.
AB  == in this study, an adenine-auxotrophic strain of edwardsiella ictaluri was constructed and its virulence, tissue persistence, and vaccine efficacy were evaluated. a clone containing the pura gene was isolated from an e. ictaluri genomic library, sequenced, and shown to have an overall sequence identity of 79.3% at the nucleotide level and 85.7% at the amino acid level with the escherichia coli pura gene. the cloned e. ictaluri pura gene was mutated by deleting a 598-bp segment of the gene and inserting the kanamycin resistance gene from tn903 into the gap. the delta pura::km(r) gene was subcloned into the suicide plasmid pgp704, and the resulting plasmid was used to deliver the modified gene into a virulent strain of e. ictaluri by conjugation. homologous recombination replaced the chromosomal pura gene with the mutated gene to create  an adenine-auxotrophic strain (lsu-e2). compared to wild-type e. ictaluri, lsu-e2 was highly attenuated by the injection, immersion, and oral routes of exposure. by the injection route, lsu-e2 had a 50% lethal dose (ld50) that was greater than 5 logs10 higher than the ld50 for wild-type e. ictaluri. in a tissue persistence  study, lsu-e2 was able to invade channel catfish by the immersion route and persist in internal organs for at least 48 h. channel catfish that were vaccinated with a single immersion dose of lsu-e2 had mortality significantly lower (p < 0.01) following a wild-type e. ictaluri challenge than that of nonvaccinated fish.

TI  == protection against enteric septicemia of catfish (ictalurus punctatus) by immunization with the r-mutant, escherichia coli (j5).
AB  == the protective effects of immunization with the rough (r) mutant, escherichia coli (j5), were evaluated in an experimental model of edwardsiella ictaluri-induced enteric septicemia of catfish (ictalurus punctatus). groups of 18 to 25 fish were administered killed e coli (j5) with or without an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or im route. vaccinated fish  were experimentally infected with virulent ed ictaluri. fish were monitored to determine survival after ed ictaluri infection. fish that received e coli (j5) in alum i.p. had enhanced survival (92%), compared with fish given e coli (j5) i.p.  only (54%, p < 0.05) or fish given saline solution i.p. (56%, p < 0.05). fish given e coli (j5) in alum i.m. had intermediate survival (77%), which did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from survival of fish in the other 3 vaccination  groups. serologic responses to ed ictaluri and e coli (j5) before and after immunization with e coli (j5) were determined, using whole-cell elisa. serologic  recognition of both whole cell antigens increased significantly (p < 0.10) in all groups; however, the most pronounced increase was observed in fish that received  e coli (j5) in alum i.p.. these results indicate the i.p. administration of e coli (j5) in alum protects against enteric septicemia of catfish.

TI  == opsonic effect of the alternative complement pathway on channel catfish peripheral blood phagocytes.
AB  == this study determined the effect of the alternative complement pathway (acp) on neutrophil and monocyte phagocytes from peripheral blood of channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus. fluorescent-labeled latex microspheres, edwardsiella ictaluri and escherichia coli were used to quantify phagocytic attachment and ingestion. activation of the acp enhanced the attachment of bacteria and microspheres to neutrophils and monocytes. activation of the acp by serum opsonization of escherichia coli increased its ingestion by neutrophils in comparison with edwardsiella ictaluri and microspheres. inactivation of the acp and c3b diminished attachment by neutrophils and monocytes, and ingestion by neutrophils of microspheres and bacteria. ingestion by monocytes was not affected by activation of the acp. in the present study, we found that the acp functions in opsonophagocytosis in catfish and that ingestion by neutrophils was especially enhanced.

TI  == chemical characterization of lipopolysaccharide from edwardsiella ictaluri, a fish pathogen.
AB  == the chemical components of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from the fish pathogen edwardsiella ictaluri (ed. ictaluri) were analyzed by sds-page, gas chromatography, and spectrophotometry, and compared with those of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli 0111:b4. only four to five low molecular weight  species of lps from ed. ictaluri were detected by silver staining after separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the low molecular weight species, as well as a low sugar content, indicate that the lps from ed. ictaluri  was of the rough type, compared with that of s. typhimurium and e. coli which were both of the smooth type lps. quantitatively, mannose was not a major sugar component in ed. ictaluri, unlike s. typhimurium. palmitic, palmitoleic, and cis-9,10-methylene-hexadecanoic acids were predominant fatty acids among the total cellular lipids of ed. ictaluri. c14 fatty acids comprised 78% of the total in the lps of this bacterium, with beta-hydroxy-myristate representing 55%. the results of this study suggest that the lipid a segment of the lps molecule of ed. ictaluri is similar to s. typhimurium and e. coli, at least with respect to fatty acid content; however, the core polysaccharide of e. ictaluri differs in that it  has twice the heptose content.
