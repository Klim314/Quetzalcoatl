TI  == evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the n. n. blokhin cancer research center, moscow, russia.
AB  == in total 122 non-duplicate bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. most of the strains belonged to the b. fragilis group (55%), followed by prevotella strains (34.4%) and fusobacterium spp (10.6%). the species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. the most common isolates were b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  ovatus and b. vulgatus. among prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were p. buccae, p. buccalis, p. oris, p. denticola and p. nigrescens, and most of the fusobacterium spp. were f. nucleatum. susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the e-test methodology. the percentage of the susceptibility of b. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (mic </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (mic </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (mic </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (mic </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. three b. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). all prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (mic >0.5 mug/ml). the susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. all fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == proteinase activity of prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus  are also known to be associated with such infection. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. a total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. prevotella loescheii, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae, and prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) a-units) lower than that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) a-units). in the case of p. loescheii, p. melaninogenica, and p. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. proteolytic activity for all species of prevotella examined was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. this study suggests that prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.

TI  == genetic relationships within the genus prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the genetic diversity and relationships within the genus prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and dna-dna hybridization. mlee revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ets) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. the index of association described by maynard smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus prevotella. a dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ets showed that species like p. bivia, p. buccae, p. oris, p. oralis, p. nigrescens, and p. denticola form clusters that are consistent with dna homologies. however, strains identified as p. melaninogenica or p. loescheii by dna-dna hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in mlee. mlee analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. it provides an alternative to 16s rrna analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high dna homology or high rrna homology.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
