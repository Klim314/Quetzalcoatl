TI  == treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  == goals: to evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by streptococcus thermophilus st10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad). background: previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in ad symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain l. salivarius ls01. s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. study: a prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum  could improve the activity of l. salivarius ls01 administered at high doses to adults with ad. twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. scoring atopic dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. results: a significant improvement in scorad index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. a slight decrease in fecal s. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. conclusions: data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for l. salivarius ls01 in the treatment of ad. the addition of tara gum and s. thermophilus st10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == lactobacilli reduce chemokine il-8 production in response to tnf-alpha and salmonella challenge of caco-2 cells.
AB  == the probiotic properties of two selected lactobacilli strains were assessed. l. salivarius and l. plantarum displayed higher hydrophobicity (48% and 54%, resp.)  and coaggregation ability with four pathogens (from 7.9% to 57.5%). l. salivarius and l. plantarum had good inhibitory effects on s. aureus (38.2% and 49.5%, resp.) attachment to caco-2 cells. live lactobacilli strains and their conditioned media effectively inhibited il-8 production (<14.6 pg/ml) in tnf-alpha-induced caco-2 cells. antibiotic-treated and the sonicated lactobacilli also maintained inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 5.0 to 36.3 pg/ml); however, the heat-treated lactobacilli lost their inhibitory effects (il-8 production from 130.2 to 161.0 pg/ml). these results suggest that both the structural components and the soluble cellular content of lactobacilli have anti-inflammatory effects. we also found that pretreatment of caco-2 cells with lactobacilli inhibited s. typhimurium-induced il-8 production (<27.3 pg/ml). however, lactobacilli did not inhibit il-8 production in caco-2 cells pretreated  with s. typhimurium. these results suggest that the tested lactobacilli strains are appropriate for preventing inflammatory diseases caused by enteric pathogens  but not for therapy. in short, l. salivarius and l. plantarum are potential candidates for the development of microbial ecological agents and functional foods.

TI  == characterization of some potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from iranian native chickens.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterize new  lab strains with high probiotic potentials from iranian (isfahan) indigenous chickens. from 90 isolated labs, 11 isolates had high growth rate under different stress conditions, including acid (ph 2.5), bile (0.5% oxgall), salt (6-15%) and  temperatures 15 and 45 degrees c, and their aggregation time was less than 120 min. based on the molecular identification using 16s rdna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to two lactobacillus salivarius and  l. reuteri species. the isolates showed different tolerance to 16 clinically and  veterinary relevant antibiotics, and most of them were resistant to or semi-tolerant of 7-15 different studied antibiotics. the es11, es12, es3 and es13 strains with resistance to or semi-tolerance of 15, 14 and 13 different antibiotics, respectively, were the most tolerant strains. the selected isolates  showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 7 different pathogenic strains. all the isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against e. coli, enterococcus hirae, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus. the isolates es6 and es11 with high antagonistic activity and resistance against 6 of the studied pathogens were the most powerful antagonistic isolates. the values and types of adhesion to the caco-2 cell cultures were significantly different (0-40  bacteria/caco-2 cell), and the maximum adhesion was observed for the isolates es6 and es13 with 35 and 40 bacteria adhesion/cell, respectively. finally, based on all the experiments, 7 strains, including es1, es6, es7, es11, es12 and es13, were selected for the further in vivo assays and possible use in the poultry industry.

TI  == bactofencin a, a new type of cationic bacteriocin with unusual immunity.
AB  == bacteriocin production is an important probiotic trait of intestinal bacteria. in this study, we identify a new type of bacteriocin, bactofencin a, produced by a porcine intestinal isolate lactobacillus salivarius dpc6502, and assess its potency against pathogenic species including staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. genome sequencing of the bacteriocin producer revealed bfna, which encodes the mature and highly basic (pi 10.59), 22-amino-acid defensin-like peptide. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectral analysis determined that bactofencin a has a molecular mass of 2,782 da and contains two cysteine residues that form an intramolecular disulfide bond. although an abc transporter and transport accessory protein were also present within the bacteriocin gene cluster, a classical bacteriocin immunity gene was not detected. interestingly, a dltb homologue was identified downstream  of bfna. dltb is usually encoded within the dlt operon of many gram-positive bacteria. it is responsible for d-alanylation of teichoic acids in the cell wall  and has previously been associated with bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. heterologous expression of this gene conferred bactofencin a-specific immunity on sensitive strains of l. salivarius and s. aureus (although not l. monocytogenes), establishing its role in bacteriocin immunity. an analysis of the distribution of bfna revealed that it was present in four additional isolates derived from porcine origin and absent from five human isolates, suggesting that its distribution is host specific. given its novelty, we anticipate that bactofencin a represents the prototype of a new class of bacteriocins characterized as being cationic, with a dltb homologue providing a cognate immunity function. importance: this study describes the identification, purification, and characterization of bactofencin a, a novel type of bacteriocin  produced by l. salivarius dpc6502. interestingly, bactofencin a is not similar to any other known bacteriocin but instead shares similarity with eukaryotic cationic antimicrobial peptides, and here, we demonstrate that it inhibits two medically significant pathogens. genome sequence analysis of the producing strain also revealed the presence of an atypical dltb homologue in the bacteriocin gene  cluster, which was lacking a classical bacteriocin immunity gene. furthermore, cloning this gene rendered sensitive strains resistant to the bacteriocin, thereby establishing its role in providing cognate bacteriocin immunity. four additional l. salivarius isolates, also of porcine origin, were found to contain  the bacteriocin biosynthesis genes and successfully produced bactofencin a, while these genes were absent from five human-derived strains investigated.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == in-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. materials and methods: saponins were extracted from bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium and purified. antimicrobial properties of these saponins against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of madhuca longifolia saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and bauhinia purpurea saponin on streptococcus mutans mtcc 890, staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. conclusion: the strong antimicrobial activity of madhuca longifolia and bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. hence, these extracted saponins may be used in  food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus adherence to caco-2 cells by lactobacilli and cell surface properties that influence attachment.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize human and animal intestinal tracts, causing certain gastrointestinal diseases. the adherence of enteric pathogens to host intestinal epithelial cells is important for their pathogenesis. in the present study, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum were investigated in vitro to examine their ability to competitively exclude s. aureus. various factors involved in attachment, including bacterial status and cell concentration, growth phase, competition patterns, and surface-layer protein extracts, were also investigated. live lactobacilli in the mid-log growth phase exhibited maximum inhibitory activity when lactobacilli were pre- or co-incubated with s. aureus. however, the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when the lactobacilli were inactivated by heating or treated with licl. furthermore, both lactobacilli possessed certain cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation ability. l. salivarius and l. plantarum strongly inhibited s. aureus adherence to caco-2 cells and their inhibition activity was significantly influenced by several factors that affect adhesion inhibition.

TI  == fibrinogen-binding and platelet-aggregation activities of a lactobacillus salivarius septicaemia isolate are mediated by a novel fibrinogen-binding protein.
AB  == the marketplace for probiotic foods is burgeoning, measured in billions of euro per annum. it is imperative, however, that all bacterial strains are fully assessed for human safety. the ability to bind fibrinogen is considered a potential pathogenicity trait that can lead to platelet aggregation, serious medical complications, and in some instances, death. here we examined strains from species frequently used as probiotics for their ability to bind human fibrinogen. only one strain (ccug 47825), a lactobacillus salivarius isolate from a case of septicaemia, was found to strongly adhere to fibrinogen. furthermore, this strain was found to aggregate human platelets at a level comparable to the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus. by sequencing the genome of ccug 47825, we  were able to identify candidate genes responsible for fibrinogen binding. complementing the genetic analysis with traditional molecular microbiological techniques enabled the identification of the novel fibrinogen receptor, ccug_2371. although only strain ccug 47825 bound fibrinogen under laboratory conditions, homologues of the novel fibrinogen binding gene ccug_2371 are widespread among l. salivarius strains, maintaining their potential to bind fibrinogen if expressed. we highlight the fact that without a full genetic analysis of strains for human consumption, potential pathogenicity traits may go  undetected.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri protects epidermal keratinocytes from staphylococcus aureus-induced cell death by competitive exclusion.
AB  == recent studies have suggested that the topical application of probiotic bacteria  can improve skin health or combat disease. we have utilized a primary human keratinocyte culture model to investigate whether probiotic bacteria can inhibit  staphylococcus aureus infection. evaluation of the candidate probiotics lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730, lactobacillus rhamnosus ac413, and lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 demonstrated that both l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus, but not l. salivarius, reduced s. aureus-induced keratinocyte cell death in both undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. keratinocyte survival was significantly higher if the probiotic was applied prior to (p < 0.01) or simultaneously with (p < 0.01) infection with s. aureus but not when added after infection had commenced (p > 0.05). the protective effect of l. reuteri was not dependent on the elaboration of inhibitory substances such as lactic acid. l. reuteri inhibited adherence of s. aureus to keratinocytes by competitive exclusion (p = 0.026). l. salivarius ucc118, however, did not inhibit s. aureus from adhering to keratinocytes (p > 0.05) and did not protect keratinocyte viability. s. aureus utilizes the alpha5beta1 integrin to adhere to  keratinocytes, and blocking of this integrin resulted in a protective effect similar to that observed with probiotics (p = 0.03). this suggests that the protective mechanism for l. reuteri-mediated protection of keratinocytes was by competitive exclusion of the pathogen from its binding sites on the cells. our results suggest that use of a topical probiotic prophylactically could inhibit the colonization of skin by s. aureus and thus aid in the prevention of infection.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == selection of probiotic bacteria for prevention of allergic diseases: immunomodulation of neonatal dendritic cells.
AB  == modification of intestinal microbiota early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes, we investigated the capacity of probiotic bacteria to interact with neonatal dendritic cells (dc) and studied the ensuing t cell polarizing effect. immature dc were generated from cord blood-derived monocytes and maturation was induced by maturation factors (mf), lipopolysaccharide (lps) plus mf and bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, lactobacillus salivarius, lactococcus lactis alone or combined with mf. after 12  days of co-culture with dc and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) as antigenic stimulus, cytokine production by autologous t cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. additionally, cells were stimulated with cd3 and cd28 monoclonal antibodies and cytokines were measured in supernatants by multiplex assay. the probiotic strains induced partial maturation of dc. full maturation of dc was induced for all strains tested when mf was added. the percentage of interleukin (il)-4 producing t cells was lower in t cell cultures stimulated with b. bifidum matured dc compared to mf and lps matured dc, which coincided with a higher percentage of interferon (ifn)-gamma-producing t cells. furthermore, t cells stimulated by b. bifidum matured dc produced significantly more il-10 compared to mf matured dc. selected species of the bifidobacterium genus prime in vitro cultured neonatal dc to polarize t cell responses and may therefore be candidates to use in primary prevention of allergic diseases.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == lactose transport in streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor iiilac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == the transport of lactose in streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. this system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme ii), two general proteins called enzyme i and hpr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor iiilac. this protein factor was purified from s. mutans atcc 27352 by chromatographies on deae-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, ultrogel aca 34, and phosphocellulose. the purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and  urea. the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. a specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor iiilac. immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor iiilac. a cross-reaction was observed with all of the s. mutans strains tested as well as with streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus lactis 11454, and staphylococcus aureus 6538. no precipitin band was observed with extracts of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

TI  == binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
