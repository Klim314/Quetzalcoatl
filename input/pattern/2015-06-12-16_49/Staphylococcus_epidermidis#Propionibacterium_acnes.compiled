TI  - The culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  - The complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. Microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). Samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16S rRNA gene community profiling. Cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with Finegoldia magna. Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as S. aureus' principle habitat. Culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. Comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. While the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach. To determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification by culturomic analyses.
TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of nanosilver with antibacterial properties using  Pinus densiflora young cone extract.
AB  - This study describes an eco-friendly, rapid method for green synthesis of silver  nanoparticles (Ag NPs) from an aqueous solution of silver nitrate using Pinus densiflora for. multicaulis Uyeki young cone extract in a single-pot process. Color changes, ultraviolet-visible spectra (444.5 nm), X-ray diffraction peaks (2theta=39.68, 46.92, 68.12, and 79.10), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the presence of Ag NPs and phytochemicals. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoparticles were mostly oval in shape, with a few triangular-shaped particles. Average particle size was 30-80 nm. Phytochemicals present in the young pine cone extract were likely responsible for the reduction of Ag(+) ions. The synthesized Ag NPs (40 mug) had a 7 mm larger zone of inhibition against the skin pathogen Brevibacterium linens than commercial Ag NPs, Propionibacterium acnes (14 mm), Bacillus cereus (9 mm) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10mm).
TI  - Viable bacteria associated with red blood cells and plasma in freshly drawn blood donations.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infection remains a leading cause of post-transfusion mortality and morbidity. Bacterial contamination is, however, detected in less than 0.1% of blood units tested. The aim of the study was to identify viable bacteria in standard blood-pack units, with particular focus on bacteria from the oral cavity, and to determine the distribution of bacteria revealed in plasma and in the red blood cell (RBC)-fraction. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Blood were separated into plasma and RBC-suspensions, which were incubated anaerobically or aerobically for 7 days on trypticase soy blood agar (TSA) or blue lactose plates. For identification colony PCR was performed using primers targeting 16S rDNA. SETTING: Blood donors attending Capital Region Blood Bank, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Hvidovre, Denmark, October 29th to December 10th 2013. PARTICIPANTS: 60 donors (>/=50 years old), self-reported medically healthy. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was observed on plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs from 62% of the blood donations. Growth was evident in 21 (35%) of 60 RBC-fractions and in 32 (53%) of 60 plasma-fractions versus 8 of 60 negative controls (p = 0.005 and p = 2.6x10-6, respectively). Propionibacterium acnes was found in 23% of the donations, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 38%. The majority of bacteria identified in the present study were either facultative anaerobic (59.5%) or anaerobic (27.8%) species, which are not likely to be detected during current routine screening. CONCLUSIONS: Viable bacteria are present in blood from donors self-reported as medically healthy, indicating that conventional test systems employed by blood banks insufficiently detect bacteria in plasma. Further investigation is needed to determine whether routine testing for anaerobic bacteria and testing of RBC-fractions for adherent bacteria should be recommended.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and  diagnostic testing for prosthetic joint infection in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - Identification of pathogen(s) associated with prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is critical for patient management. Historically, many laboratories have not routinely identified organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. The advent of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has enhanced clinical laboratory capacity for accurate species-level identification. The aim of this study was to describe the species-level identification of microorganisms isolated from periprosthetic tissue and fluid specimens using MALDI-TOF MS alongside other rapid identification tests in a clinical microbiology laboratory. Results of rapid identification of bacteria isolated from periprosthetic joint fluid and/or tissue specimens were correlated with clinical findings at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, between May 2012 and May 2013. There were 178 PJI and 82 aseptic failure (AF) cases analyzed, yielding 770 organisms (median, 3/subject; range, 1-19/subject). MALDI-TOF MS was employed for the identification of 455 organisms (59%) in 197 subjects (123 PJIs and 74 AFs), with 89% identified to the species level using this technique. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 68% and 93% of isolates in PJI and AF, respectively. However, the profile of species associated with infection compared to specimen contamination differed. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus caprae were always associated with infection, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis were equally likely to be a pathogen or a contaminant, whereas the other coagulase-negative staphylococci were more frequently contaminants. Most streptococcal and Corynebacterium isolates were pathogens. The likelihood that an organism was a pathogen or contaminant differed with the prosthetic joint location, particularly in the case of Propionibacterium acnes. MALDI-TOF MS is a valuable tool for the identification of bacteria isolated from patients with prosthetic joints, providing species-level identification that may inform culture interpretation of pathogens versus contaminants.
TI  - Preoperative and intraoperative infection workup in apparently aseptic revision shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - The possibility of infection should be considered in every revision shoulder arthroplasty even in the absence of clinical symptoms and signs of infection because indolent infection is prevalent. Detection of infection in apparently aseptic failed arthroplasties poses a diagnostic challenge as the conventional principles and criteria used for hip and knee arthroplasty are not generally applicable. Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis are among the infectious organisms most commonly identified in such situations. Serum inflammatory markers are essential but are often unreliable as they have poor sensitivity in the shoulder. Preoperative shoulder joint aspiration culture is an important step but is subject to high false-negative rates. Lower cutoff values of synovial fluid analysis are used for detection of periprosthetic infection than for native joint infection as demonstrated in the knee literature. Intraoperatively, frozen section should be considered when a diagnosis of infection has not been established even in the presence of clinical suspicion. Gram stain is currently not recommended because of its low sensitivity and negative predictive value. Intraoperative culture is critical and should be performed whenever there is clinical suspicion of infection. Unexpected positive intraoperative cultures are not uncommon, and 6% to 25% of them appear to represent true infection as demonstrated with positive follow-up cultures or subsequent development of infection. In revision shoulder arthroplasty, determining the presence of infection can be difficult. A standardized approach is needed to determine the best course of treatment in this particular clinical setting.
TI  - Synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% proteinase K and 2% CHX (with and without ultrasonics). 2% CHX was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (P < 0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase K and CHX group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu mL-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log10 cfu mL-1 ) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu mL-1 ). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase K. CONCLUSION: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.
TI  - Biogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.
AB  - The varied topography of human skin offers a unique opportunity to study how the  body's microenvironments influence the functional and taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Phylogenetic marker gene-based studies have identified many bacteria and fungi that colonize distinct skin niches. Here metagenomic analyses of diverse body sites in healthy humans demonstrate that local biogeography and strong individuality define the skin microbiome. We developed a relational analysis of bacterial, fungal and viral communities, which showed not only site specificity but also individual signatures. We further identified strain-level variation of dominant species as heterogeneous and multiphyletic. Reference-free analyses captured the uncharacterized metagenome through the development of a multi-kingdom gene catalogue, which was used to uncover genetic signatures of species lacking reference genomes. This work is foundational for human disease studies investigating inter-kingdom interactions, metabolic changes and strain tracking, and defines the dual influence of biogeography and individuality on microbial composition and function.
TI  - The In vitro anti-acne activity of two unani drugs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne is the most common disorder treated by dermatologists. As many as 80-90% of all adolescents have some type of acne and 30% of them require medical treatment. It is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit characterized by the formation of open and closed comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. AIMS: The present study was conducted to investigate the in vitro anti-acne activity of two Unani single drugs Darchini (Cinnamomum zeylanicum Bl.) and Tukhm Khashkhash (Papaver somniferum L. seeds). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts of both drugs were investigated against two acne causing bacteria, i.e., Propionibacterium acne and Staphylococcus epidermidis using well diffusion method. RESULTS: The result showed that both drugs were active against the two bacteria. Against P. acne aqueous and ethanolic extract of Darchini and Tukhm Khashkhash showed the zone of inhibition of 18 +/- 1.02 mm and 18 +/- 1.6 mm and 13 +/- 1.04 mm and 14 +/- 1.8 mm, respectively. Against S. epidermidis aqueous, hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts of Darchini showed 22 +/- 1.7 mm, 22 +/- 1.2 mm and 15 +/- 1.8 mm zone of inhibition respectively. Hydroalcoholic and ethanolic extracts of Tukhm Khashkhash showed 15 +/- 1.09 mm and 13 +/- 1.6 mm zone of inhibition respectively. CONCLUSION: This suggests that C. zeylanicum and P. somniferum have potential against acne causing bacteria and hence they can be used in topical anti-acne preparations and may address the antibiotic resistance of the bacteria.
TI  - Lipase-mediated lipid removal from propolis extract and its antiradical and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propolis contains many antioxidants such as polyphenols and flavonoids. However, propolis-derived lipid components interrupt an efficient isolation of antioxidants from propolis extract. We examined the effectiveness of various lipase treatments for the removal of lipids from propolis extract and evaluated the biological features of the extract. RESULTS: Lipase OF and Novozyme 435 treatments did not reduce fatty acid level in propolis extract. However, Lipozyme TL IM-treated propolis extract showed a significant decrease in fatty acid level, suggesting the removal of lipids. Lipozyme RM IM also significantly decreased the fatty acid level of the extract, but was accompanied by the reduction of polyphenols and flavonoids, which are antioxidants. In Lipozyme TL IM treatment, an increase in active flavonoids, such as Artepillin C and kaempferide, was observed, with a slight increase of ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) radical-scavenging activity. In addition, antimicrobial activity towards skin health-related bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes was enhanced by Lipozyme TL IM treatment. CONCLUSION: Lipozyme TL IM treatment effectively removes lipids from propolis extract and enhances antibacterial activity. Therefore, we suggest that Lipozyme TL IM is a useful lipase for lipid removal of propolis extract. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.
TI  - Fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  - Skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. Additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by Gram-negative species. Topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. In such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. However, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of sensitization are not uncommon. As a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. Fusidic acid (FA) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, FA reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that FA, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against S. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corinebatteria, Clostridia. Additionally, FA presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. Such feature makes FA particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. Finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, FA has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. Overall, data on FA efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.
TI  - Management of deep postoperative shoulder infections: is there a role for open biopsy during staged treatment?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the gold standard treatment of 2-stage exchange arthroplasty, reinfection after periprosthetic shoulder infections and periarticular osteomyelitis can be as high as 37%. This study describes a protocol to detect persistent deep shoulder infection before revision arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients who presented with periprosthetic shoulder infections and osteomyelitis after previous surgery were treated with a standardized protocol of irrigation and debridement (I&D), removal of implants, antibiotic cement spacer placement, and pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks. After completion of antibiotics and resolution of clinical symptoms, specimens were obtained from an open biopsy performed in the operating room, followed by revision arthroplasty at a later date if final cultures were without evidence of infection. If evidence of infection persisted, then another course of I&D and antibiotic treatment was performed. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included between 2005 and 2012. The most common pathogens isolated were Propionibacterium acnes (44%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%), and S aureus (22%). Four patients (22%) had evidence of persistent infection on specimens from open biopsy and required subsequent rounds of I&D before replantation. The infecting pathogen in 75% of patients with persistent infection was P acnes, and 38% of patients with P acnes infection had recurrence. Mean follow-up of 24 months showed no signs of recurrent infection in any patient and an average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon score of 71. CONCLUSION: Despite prior staged treatment for deep postoperative shoulder infections, specimens obtained from open biopsy before replantation detected a persistent infection rate of 22% in all patients and 38% in patients with P acnes infection, which may indicate a role for this procedure in the prevention of recurrent infections.
TI  - Enzymatic treatment of specimens before DNA extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). RESULTS: Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. DISCUSSION: Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the anti-bacterial effect of two preparations of platelet  rich plasma compared with cefazolin and whole blood.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the antibacterial properties of two different platelet-rich plasma (PRP) platelet concentration preparations (PRPLP and PRPHP) through a time-kill assay. METHODS: Two different PRP preparations - a single spin process yielding lower white blood cells and platelet concentration (PRPLP) and one yielding high platelet and white blood cell concentration (PRPHP) - were obtained from 2 individuals. PRPLP, PRPHP, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), whole blood and Cefazolin were added to experimental reaction tubes, each containing a single bacterial inoculum of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Two dilutions (1:1,000, and 1:10,000) were plated in duplicate tubes, along with positive (blood and PBS) and negative (Cefazolin) controls and assessed at five time points (0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours). RESULTS: After centrifugation, platelet count of PRPLP was 386 +/- 65.5 x 103/?L and PRPHP was 867 +/- 234.4 x 103/?L. Both PRP products showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) in bacterial growth at 8 hours compared to whole blood. CONCLUSION: The application of PRPLP and PRPHP showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 8 hours for S. aureus, S. epi, MRSA and P. acnes compared to the whole blood control group. S.epi, MRSA, and P. acnes also showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 24 hours. Despite differences in platelet concentration and WBC concentration, no difference in antibacterial activity was seen between the two preparations.
TI  - Safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: To establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/mL; Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/mL). Evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/mL). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population with minimal local and systemic risks. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. METHODS: Topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. Serum and drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (PODs). Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. Underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). Mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/mL (POD 0) to 1.9 mug/mL (POD 1) to 1.1 mug/mL (POD 2). Mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/mL (POD 0) to 251 mug/mL (POD 1) to 115 mug/mL (POD 2). No vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. One patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. CONCLUSION: Topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/mL). There were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
TI  - Relationship between the severity of acne vulgaris and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from acne lesions in a hospital in Japan.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis are normal skin inhabitants that are frequently isolated from lesions caused by acne, and these micro-organisms are considered to contribute to the inflammation of acne. In the present study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities and resistance mechanisms of P. acnes and S. epidermidis isolated from patients with acne vulgaris in a university hospital in Japan from 2009 to 2010. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between the antimicrobial resistance of P. acnes and the severity of acne vulgaris. Some P. acnes strains (18.8 %; 13/69) were resistant to clindamycin. All strains had a mutation in the 23S rRNA gene, except for one strain that expressed erm(X) encoding a 23S rRNA methylase. Tetracycline-resistant P. acnes strains were found to represent 4.3 % (3/69) of the strains, and this resistance was caused by a mutation in the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, three strains with reduced susceptibility to nadifloxacin (MIC = 16 microg ml(-1)) were detected. When analysing the correlation between the antimicrobial resistance of P. acnes and S. epidermidis, more than 80 % of the patients who carried clindamycin-resistant P. acnes also carried clindamycin-resistant S. epidermidis. However, no epidemic strain that exhibited antimicrobial resistance was detected in the P. acnes strains when analysed by PFGE. Therefore, our results suggest that the antimicrobial resistance of P. acnes is closely related to antimicrobial therapy. Additionally, those P. acnes strains tended to be frequently found in severe acne patients rather than in mild acne patients. Consequently, the data support a relationship between using antimicrobial agents and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plumbagin derivative-rich Plumbago indica root extracts and chemical stability.
AB  - The extraction studies and a one-step purification of the crude extract of Plumbago indica using silica-gel vacuum chromatography provided a plumbagin derivative-rich P. indica root extract (PPE). The PPE was standardised to contain total plumbagin derivatives not less than 13% w/w. Antibacterial activities of the standardised PPE and three naphthoquinones, plumbagin, elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin, against Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated by using the microdilution assay. The bactericidal activities of the PPE against these bacteria were much stronger than those of elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin and almost equal to those of plumbagin. Stability of the PPE was determined under various conditions through a period of four months. The PPE was stable over a period of four months when stored as a dried powder but only in a well-closed container protected from light under 4 +/- 2 degrees C.
TI  - The microbiome of the middle meatus in healthy adults.
AB  - Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are multifactorial disease processes in which bacteria may play a role either in infection or stimulation of the inflammatory process. Rhinosinusitis has been historically studied with culture-based techniques, which have implicated several common pathogens in disease states. More recently, the NIH Human Microbiome Project has examined the microbiome at a number of accessible body sites, and demonstrated differences among healthy and diseased patients. Recent DNA-based sinus studies have suggested that healthy sinuses are not sterile, as was previously believed, but the normal sinonasal microbiome has yet to be thoroughly examined. Middle meatus swab specimens were collected from 28 consecutive patients presenting with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Bacterial colonization was assessed in these specimens using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. All subjects were positive for bacterial colonization of the middle meatus. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were the most prevalent and abundant microorganisms detected. Rich and diverse bacterial assemblages are present in the sinonasal cavity in the normal state, including opportunistic pathogens typically found in the nasopharynx. This work helps establish a baseline for understanding how the sinonasal microbiome may impact diseases of the upper airways.
TI  - Bacterial skin commensals and their role as host guardians.
AB  - Recent years' investigations of the co-evolution and functional integration of the human body and its commensal microbiota have disclosed that the microbiome has a major impact on physiological functions including protection against infections, reaction patterns in the immune system, and disposition for inflammation-mediated diseases. Two ubiquitous members of the skin microbiota, the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, are predominant on human epithelia and in sebaceous follicles, respectively. Their successful colonisation is a result of a commensal or even mutualistic lifestyle, favouring traits conferring persistency over aggressive host-damaging properties. Some bacterial properties suggest an alliance with the host to keep transient, potential pathogens at bay, such as the ability of S. epidermidis to produce antimicrobials, or the production of short-chain fatty acids by P. acnes. These features can function together with host-derived components of the innate host defence to establish and maintain the composition of a health-associated skin microbiota. However, depending largely on the host status, the relationship between the human host and S. epidermidis/P. acnes can also have parasitic features. Both microorganisms are frequently isolated from opportunistic infections. S. epidermidis is a causative agent of hospital-acquired infections, mostly associated with the use of medical devices. P. acnes is suspected to be of major importance in the pathogenesis of acne and also in a number of other opportunistic infections. In this review we will present bacterial factors and traits of these two key members of our skin microbiota and discuss how they contribute to mutualistic and parasitic properties. The elucidation of their roles in health-promoting or disease-causing processes could lead to new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against skin disorders and other S. epidermidis/P. acnes-associated diseases, and increase our understanding of the delicate interplay of the skin microbiota with the human host.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis in the human skin microbiome mediates fermentation to  inhibit the growth of Propionibacterium acnes: implications of probiotics in acne vulgaris.
AB  - Increasing evidence demonstrates that commensal microorganisms in the human skin  microbiome help fight pathogens and maintain homeostasis of the microbiome. However, it is unclear how these microorganisms maintain biological balance when one of them overgrows. The overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a commensal skin bacterium, has been associated with the progression of acne vulgaris. Our results demonstrate that skin microorganisms can mediate fermentation of glycerol, which is naturally produced in skin, to enhance their inhibitory effects on P. acnes growth. The skin microorganisms, most of which have been identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), in the microbiome of human fingerprints can ferment glycerol and create inhibition zones to repel a colony of overgrown P. acnes. Succinic acid, one of four short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) detected in fermented media by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, effectively inhibits the growth of P. acnes in vitro and in vivo. Both intralesional injection and topical application of succinic acid to P. acnes-induced lesions markedly suppress the P. acnes-induced inflammation in mice. We demonstrate for the first time that bacterial members in the skin microbiome can undergo fermentation to rein in the overgrowth of P. acnes. The concept of bacterial interference between P. acnes and S. epidermidis via fermentation can be applied to develop probiotics against acne vulgaris and other skin diseases. In addition, it will open up an entirely new area of study for the biological function of the skin microbiome in promoting human health.
TI  - The effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  - AIM: To establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K with or without ultrasonic activation. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. The treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase K, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (with and without ultrasonics). NaOCl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: Nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium pH became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. The CLSM showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. On the disc model, trypsin and proteinase K were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. NaOCl was the most effective agent (P < 0.001). In the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (P < 0.05). Chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase K (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (P < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/- 4.9). CONCLUSION: Trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.
TI  - The role of the skin barrier in modulating the effects of common skin microbial species on the inflammation, differentiation and proliferation status of epidermal keratinocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin resident microbial species are often thought of either as pathogenic or commensal. However, little is known about the role of the skin barrier in modulating their potential for causing disease. To investigate this question we measured the effects of three microbial species commonly found on the skin (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes) on a reconstructed human epidermal model by either applying the bacteria on the model surface (intact barrier) or adding them to the culture medium (simulating barrier breach). RESULTS: When added to the medium, all of the tested species induced inflammatory responses and keratinocyte cell death with species-specific potency. P. acnes and S. epidermidis induced specific alterations in the expression of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation markers, suggesting a barrier reparation response. S. aureus induced complete keratinocyte cell death. On the contrary, topically applied S. epidermidis and P. acnes caused no inflammatory response even when tested at high concentrations, while topical S. aureus induced a weak reaction. None of the tested species were able to alter the expression of keratinocyte differentiation or expression markers, when applied topically. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the skin barrier prevents the effects of common skin bacteria on epidermal keratinocyte inflammation, differentiation and proliferation and highlight the importance of skin barrier in defending against the pathogenic effects of common skin bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriological features of infectious spondylodiscitis at Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat.
AB  - To review the bacteriological features of infectious spondylodiscitis and provide recommendations for the initial therapy which remains empirical in our context. Retrospective study including patients diagnosed with spondylodiscitis over a period of 4 years (2006-2009) at the Rabat Military Teaching Hospital. During the study period, we analysed 30 cases: the mean age was 49.9 years and 21 cases (70%) were male. The patients were predominantly hospitalized in neurosurgery department (15/30) followed by rheumatology department (10/30). The site of infection was lumbar in 21 cases (21/30), dorsal in 7 cases (7/30). 26 cultures were positive of which 19 (19/26) were monomicrobial. Tuberculosis (TB) was implicated in 10 cases (10/30) including 4 cases in association with common organisms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species). Brucella melitensis was isolated in 1 case. Infections caused by pyogenic bacteria were isolated in 15 cases of which 12 (12/15) revealed simple organisms including Gram-positive cocci in 9 cases (9/12) with 3 cases of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli in 3 cases (3/12) with 2 cases of P. aeruginosa. Blood cultures carried out for 16 patients were positive in 7 cases. The anatomopathologic exams carried out for 20 patients found in 6 cases epithelioid granulomata and giants cells with caseous necrosis in total concordance with TB culture. TB is the most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis in Morocco. Our study found the same frequency for non-specific and specific germs. Empirical treatment must take into account S. aureus and M. tuberculosis.
TI  - A small peptide with therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  - A designed peptide named LZ1 with 15 amino acid residues containing strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria pathogens of acne vulgaris including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. Especially, it exerted strong anti-P. acnes ability. The minimal inhibitory concentration against three strains of P. acnes was only 0.6 microg/ml, which is 4 times lower than that of clindamycin. In experimental mice skin colonization model, LZ1 significantly reduced the number of P. acnes colonized on the ear, P. acnes-induced ear swelling, and inflammatory cell infiltration. It ameliorated inflammation induced by P. acnes by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta. LZ1 showed little cytotoxicity on human keratinocyte and hemolytic activity on human blood red cells. Furthermore, LZ1 was very stable in human plasma. Combined with its potential bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties, simple structure and high stability, LZ1 might be an ideal candidate for the treatment of acne.
TI  - Calcarides A-E, antibacterial macrocyclic and linear polyesters from a Calcarisporium strain.
AB  - Bioactive compounds were detected in crude extracts of the fungus, Calcarisporium sp. KF525, which was isolated from German Wadden Sea water samples. Purification of the metabolites from the extracts yielded the five known polyesters, 15G256alpha, alpha-2, beta, beta-2 and pi (1-5), and five new derivatives thereof, named calcarides A-E (6-10). The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy supported by UV and HRESIMS data. The compounds exhibited inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Xanthomonas campestris and Propionibacterium acnes. As the antibacterial activities were highly specific with regard to compound and test strain, a tight structure-activity relationship is assumed.
TI  - Antityrosinase and antimicrobial activities from Thai medicinal plants.
AB  - Various dermatological disorders and microbial skin infection can cause hyperpigmentation. Therefore, screenings for whitening and antimicrobial agents from Thai medicinal plants have been of research interest. Seventy-seven ethanol plant extracts were investigated for antityrosinase activity, eleven samples showed the tyrosinase inhibition more than 50 % were further preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity by agar disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution methods. Artocarpus integer (Thunb.) Merr. (Moraceae) root extract, which showed the potential of tyrosinase inhibition with 90.57 +/- 2.93 % and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and Trichophyton mentagophytes with inhibition zone as 9.10 +/- 0.00, 10.67 +/- 0.09, 15.25 +/- 0.05 and 6.60 +/- 0.17 mm, respectively was selected for phytochemical investigation. Three pure compounds were isolated as artocarpin, cudraflavone C and artocarpanone. And artocarpanone exhibited anti-tyrosinase effect; artocarpin and cudraflavone C also showed the potential of antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. acnes with MIC at 2, 4 and 2 mug/ml, respectively and MBC at 32 mug/ml for these bacteria. So, these pure compounds are interesting for further study in order to provide possibilities of new whitening and antibacterial development. This will be the first report of phytochemical investigation of A. integer root.
TI  - Identification of household bacterial community and analysis of species shared with human microbiome.
AB  - Microbial populations in indoor environments, where we live and eat, are important for public health. Various bacterial species reside in the kitchen, and refrigerators, the major means of food storage within kitchens, can be a direct source of food borne illness. Therefore, the monitoring of microbiota in the refrigerator is important for food safety. We investigated and compared bacterial communities that reside in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator and on the seat of the toilet, which is recognized as highly colonized by microorganisms, in ten houses using high-throughput sequencing. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were predominant in refrigerator and toilet samples. However, Proteobacteria was more abundant in the refrigerator, and Firmicutes was more abundant in the toilet. These household bacterial communities were compared with those of human skin and gut to identify potential sources of household bacteria. Bacterial communities from refrigerators and toilets shared more species in common with human skin than gut. Opportunistic pathogens, including Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were identified as species shared with human skin and gut microbiota. This approach can provide a general background of the household microbiota and a potential method of source-tracking for public health purposes.
TI  - The oral cavity is not a primary source for implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To test the hypothesis that the oral cavity is a potential source for implantable pacemaker and cardioverter defibrillators infections, the bacterial diversity on explanted rhythm heart management devices was investigated and compared to the oral microbiome. METHODS: A metagenomic approach was used to analyze the bacterial diversity on the surfaces of non-infected and infected pacemakers. The DNA from surfaces swaps of 24 non-infected and 23 infected pacemaker were isolated and subjected to bacterial-specific DNA amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism- (SSCP) and sequencing analysis. Species-specific primer sets were used to analyze for any correlation between bacterial diversity on pacemakers and in the oral cavity. RESULTS: DNA of bacterial origin was detected in 21 cases on infected pacemakers and assigned to the bacterial phylotypes Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus schleiferi and Stapyhlococcus. In 17 cases bacterial DNA was found on pacemakers with no clinical signs of infections. On the basis of the obtained sequence data, the phylotypes Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus and an uncultured bacterium were identified. Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the only bacteria detected in pacemeaker (n = 25) and oral samples (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the coincidental detection of bacteria on infected devices and in the oral cavity is low and the detected bacteria are highly abundant colonizers of non-oral human niches.The transmission of oral bacteria to the lead or device of implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators is unlikely relevant for the pathogenesis of pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of southern African medicinal plants with dermatological relevance: From an ethnopharmacological screening approach, to combination studies and the isolation of a bioactive compound.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ethnobotanical reports on more than 100 southern  African medicinal plants with dermatological relevance have been highlighted, yet there is still limited scientific data to support claims for their antimicrobial effectiveness against skin pathogens. Guided by ethnobotanical data, this paper explores the antimicrobial efficacies of southern African medicinal plants used to treat skin ailments. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antimicrobial properties of southern African medicinal plants against dermatologically relevant pathogens. The study also aimed at providing a scientific rationale for the traditional use of plant combinations to treat skin diseases and the isolation of the bio-active compound from the most active species, Aristea ecklonii (Iridaceae). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organic and aqueous extracts (132) were prepared from 47 plant species and screened for antimicrobial properties against dermatologically relevant pathogens using the micro-titre plate dilution method. Four different plant combinations were investigated for interactive properties and the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) calculated. Isobolograms were used to further investigate the antimicrobial interactive properties of Pentanisia prunelloides combined with Elephantorrhiza elephantina at varied ratios. A bioactivity-guided fractionation process was adopted to fractionate the organic leaf extract of Aristea ecklonii. RESULTS: Plants demonstrating notable broad-spectrum activities (MIC values </=1.00mg/ml) against the tested pathogens included extracts from Aristea ecklonii, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Diospyros mespiliformis, Elephantorrhiza elephantina, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Gunnera perpensa, Harpephyllum caffrum, Hypericum perforatum, Melianthus comosus, Terminalia sericea and Warburgia salutaris. The organic extract of Elephantorrhiza elephantina, a plant reportedly used to treat acne vulgaris, demonstrated noteworthy antimicrobial activity (MIC value of 0.05mg/ml) against Propionibacterium acnes. Similarly, Diospyros mespiliformis reported for its traditional use to treat ringworm, also displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes (MIC 0.10mg/ml) and Microsporum canis (MIC 0.50mg/ml). The aqueous root extracts of Pentanisia prunelloides combined (1:1) with Elephantorrhiza elephantina displayed synergistic interactions (FIC values 0.31-0.38) against Staphylococcus aureus, gentamycin-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Fractionation of Aristea ecklonii resulted in the isolation of the known bio-active compound, plumbagin, displaying noteworthy antimicrobial activity (MIC range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml). CONCLUSION: Most of the plant extracts demonstrated pathogen specific antimicrobial effects with a few exhibiting broad-spectrum activities. Positive antimicrobial effects noted for plants such as Elephantorrhiza elephantina and Diospyros mespiliformis used for acne vulgaris and ringworm infections, respectively, give some validation to their reported traditiona l uses. Synergistic interactions noted for Pentanisia prunelloides combined with Elephantorrhiza elephantina validate an enhanced antimicrobial effect when used in combination. Noteworthy antimicrobial activities (MIC range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml) were observed for plumbagin isolated from Aristea ecklonii.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic susceptibilities: a 10-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents over 10 years. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all cases with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution from 2002 through 2011. The outcome measures included all intravitreal isolates identified as well as antibiotic susceptibilities. RESULTS: A total of 448 organisms were isolated during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 30.1% (135/448), Streptococcus viridians group in 10.9% (49/448), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.8% (35/448), Candida albicans in 5.8% (26/443), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6.0% (27/448), Propionibacterium acnes in 4.7% (21/448), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3.1% (14/448). Overall, 327 (72.9%) of 448 isolates were gram-positive organisms, 48 (10.7%) of 448 isolates were gram-negative organisms, 71 (15.8%) of 448 isolates were fungi, and 2 (0.4%) of 448 isolates were viruses. For gram-positive organisms, susceptibilities were the following: vancomycin, 100%; gentamicin, 88.0%; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 77.5%; levofloxacin, 58.5%; oxacillin, 54.7%; ciprofloxacin, 51.0%; gatifloxacin, 51.0%; and moxifloxacin, 47.0%. For gram-negative organisms, susceptibilities were the following: ceftazidime, 100%; levofloxacin, 100%; ciprofloxacin, 95.0%; tobramycin, 90.6%; gentamicin, 80.6%; and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 59.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy generally is the recommendation as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may guide the use of initial antifungal agents.
TI  - Dandruff is associated with disequilibrium in the proportion of the major bacterial and fungal populations colonizing the scalp.
AB  - The bacterial and fungal communities associated with dandruff were investigated using culture-independent methodologies in the French subjects. The major bacterial and fungal species inhabiting the scalp subject's were identified by cloning and sequencing of the conserved ribosomal unit regions (16S for bacterial and 28S-ITS for fungal) and were further quantified by quantitative PCR. The two main bacterial species found on the scalp surface were Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while Malassezia restricta was the main fungal inhabitant. Dandruff was correlated with a higher incidence of M. restricta and S. epidermidis and a lower incidence of P. acnes compared to the control population (p<0.05). These results suggested for the first time using molecular methods, that dandruff is linked to the balance between bacteria and fungi of the host scalp surface.
TI  - Single-stage revision for peri-prosthetic shoulder infection: outcomes and results.
AB  - There have been only a few small studies of patients with an infected shoulder replacement treated with a single-stage exchange procedure. We retrospectively reviewed 35 patients (19 men and 16 women) with a peri-prosthetic infection of the shoulder who were treated in this way. A total of 26 were available for clinical examination; three had died, two were lost to follow-up and four patients had undergone revision surgery. The mean follow-up time was 4.7 years (1.1 to 13.25), with an infection-free survival of 94%. The organisms most commonly isolated intra-operatively were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes; two patients developed a recurrent infection. Three different types of prosthesis were used: a hemiarthroplasty, a hemiarthroplasty with a bipolar head and reverse prosthesis. The mean Constant-Murley score at final follow-up was 43.3 (14 to 90) for patients with a hemiarthroplasty, 56 (40 to 88) for those with a hemiarthroplasty with a bipolar head and 61 (7 to 90) for those with a reverse prosthesis. The mean hospital stay was 10.6 days (5 to 29). Single-stage exchange is a successful and practical treatment for patients with peri-prosthetic infection of the shoulder.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Bacterial infection as a likely cause of adverse reactions to polyacrylamide hydrogel fillers in cosmetic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of long-lasting adverse reactions to gel fillers used in cosmetic surgery is not known. Bacterial infection and immunological reaction to the product have been suggested. METHODS: We performed a case-control study, with 77 biopsies and 30 cytology specimens originating from 59 patients with adverse reactions to polyacrylamide gel, and 54 biopsies and 2 cytology specimens from 28 control subjects with no adverse reactions. Samples from 5 patients and 4 controls could not be investigated for presence of bacteria owing to limited material. Samples from the remaining 54 patients and 24 controls were systematically examined for the presence of bacteria by culture, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Gram stain, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Bacteria, mostly normal skin bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, were identified in bacteriologically investigated samples from 53 of 54 patients (98%), and in none of the 24 controls (0%). The bacteria were lying in small clusters, which in symptomatic lesions were detected up to 5 years postinjection. CONCLUSIONS: Commensal bacteria of low virulence are capable of producing long-term infection in the presence of polyacrylamide filler in cosmetic surgery, possibly due to a biofilm mode of growth. Adequate skin preparation and use of sterile technique in these procedures are mandatory, but antibiotic prophylaxis prior to injection of nondegradable gels like polyacrylamide should be explored as well.
TI  - The fate of elbows with unexpected positive intraoperative cultures during revision elbow arthroplasty.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An intraoperative culture sample obtained during revision elbow arthroplasty that is unexpectedly positive poses a dilemma for the surgeon. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of positive cultures during revision elbow arthroplasty when infection is not suspected preoperatively, and the long-term implications of these positive cultures. METHODS: Two hundred and thirteen consecutive revision elbow arthroplasties were performed at our institution between 2000 and 2007. Of these, sixteen patients had unexpected positive intraoperative cultures. RESULTS: The majority of cultures grew either Staphylococcus epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes. Twelve patients had more than two years of follow-up. One of the twelve patients was treated as for an infection because of unexplained early implant loosening and the isolation of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Ten of the twelve elbows were treated as "contaminants" and did not receive long-term antibiotic treatment. Nine of these ten remained infection-free at the time of the final follow-up, while the remaining one developed an infection with a different organism. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, there was a 7.5% chance of encountering an unexpected positive result on intraoperative culture at the time of revision elbow arthroplasty. The majority of patients were successfully treated without antibiotics with a low rate of failure. A minority were considered as infections, typically presenting with unexplained early loosening and isolation of an organism on solid culture medium.
TI  - [Effectiveness of antimicrobial formulations for acne based on orange (Citrus sinensis) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L) essential oils].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently, the antimicrobial resistance has developed in bacterial  strains involved in the development of acne. Therefore, alternatives to antibiotic treatment have become necessary. OBJECTIVES: Gel formulations were designed based on essential oils and acetic acid, and their effectiveness was evaluated in patients affected by acne. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Masked simple experimental study of three gel formulations on 28 volunteer patients, separated in four groups of seven patients. Treatments were applied daily for eight weeks and consisted of (1) antibacterial (essential oils), (2) keratolytic medication (3) essential oils mixed with acetic acetic, and (4) kerolytic medication with acetic acid. Weekly checks were conducted to evaluate patient improvement. RESULTS: All groups reported an improvement of the acne condition, which ranged between 43% and 75% clearance of lesions. Evidence of treatment disappeared within minutes, showing little discomfort or side effects after application. CONCLUSIONS: The essential oil formulations were chemically and physically stable during application of treatments. This was demonstrated by gas chromatography, where no evidence no change neither the composition profiles of essential oils nor in acetic acid. The results were ranked good to excellent, particularly for the acetic acid mixture, which achieved improvements of 75%. This appeared to be a result of their joint antiseptic and keratolytic activity. Side effects (burning and redness) disappeared within a few minutes of completing the application, therefore, did not interfere with adherence to treatment.
TI  - Study of the vulvar skin in healthy Japanese women: components of the stratum corneum and microbes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the physiological conditions of vulvar skin in Caucasian populations have been characterized, little is known about these conditions in Japanese women. METHODS: Skin of the labia, groin, mons pubis, and inner thigh was examined in 40 healthy Japanese women outwith their menstrual period. Skin moisture, skin pH, ceramide content and inflammatory cytokine proteins of the stratum corneum, and bacterial flora were assessed. RESULTS: Skin moisture was found to be significantly lower in the labia than at the other three sites examined. No differences were found in skin pH. A significant difference in ceramide content was observed between the groin and inner thigh. The ratio of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and interleukin-1alpha receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was significantly higher in the labia than in the other sites. Numbers of total bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Lactobacillus spp. were greater in the labia and mons pubis sites compared with the inner thigh. Prevotella spp. were found only in the labia. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese women, the skin at the labia is drier and more inflammatory than the skin at the groin, mons pubis, and inner thigh; this cannot be explained by the ceramide content and/or pH of the stratum corneum. Prevotella spp. may perform a key role in the vulvar skin of Japanese women.
TI  - Clinical meaning of unexpected positive cultures (UPC) in revision shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study analyzed the prevalence and clinical meaning of unexpected positive cultures (UPCs) in revision shoulder arthroplasty for causes different than infection. METHODS: Between 1976 and 2007, 107 consecutive patients with UPCs, no previous suspicion of infection, and fulfilling inclusion criteria were identified. Forty-five partial (PSA) and 62 total shoulder arthroplasties (TSA) with different preoperative diagnoses were reviewed. Cases were classified as true infections, possible infections, contaminants, and undetermined. Mean follow-up was 5.6 +/- 5.3 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of UPC was 15%. Male sex was a risk factor for UPC. Results of preoperative blood tests and intraoperative pathology were negative in 94 and 97 cases, respectively. Most prevalent bacteria were Propionibacterium acnes (n = 68) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 21). Fifty-three patients received treatment with antibiotics and 54 did not. In 11 patients, a postoperative arthroplasty infection during follow-up was diagnosed by culture and was produced by the same microorganism as the one isolated on the UPC (true infection). Risk factors for true infection vs contamination included revision of a TSA vs a PSA and the number of previous surgeries. Antibiotic use and number of positive cultures did not influence the rate of true infections. CONCLUSIONS: UPCs are a prevalent condition in revision shoulder arthroplasty for causes different than infection. In at least 25% of cases, UPC had no clinical relevance. In 10% of cases, a persistent infection was demonstrated.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand.
AB  - The vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. In this study, vegetables and fruits native to the Northeast region of Thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. For vegetables, the extracts of Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and Sauropus androgynus (Linn.) Merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by DPPH scavenging (IC5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively) and FRAP antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and 74.00+/-0.04 mmol FeSO4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of vegetable). For fruits, the extracts derived from Terminalia chebula Retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of DPPH scavenging (IC50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively), FRAP antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol FeSO4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). The antibacterial assays showed that Moringa oleifera Lam., Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr., Terminalia chebula Retz. and Phyllanthus emblica Linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Propionibacterium acnes. The results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to Thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.
TI  - Time series community genomics analysis reveals rapid shifts in bacterial species, strains, and phage during infant gut colonization.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microbiome undergoes shifts in species and strain abundances, yet dynamics involving closely related microorganisms remain largely unknown because most methods cannot resolve them. We developed new metagenomic methods and utilized them to track species and strain level variations in microbial communities in 11 fecal samples collected from a premature infant during the first month of life. Ninety six percent of the sequencing reads were assembled into scaffolds of >500 bp in length that could be assigned to organisms at the strain level. Six essentially complete ( approximately 99%) and two near-complete genomes were assembled for bacteria that comprised as little as 1% of the community, as well as nine partial genomes of bacteria representing as little as 0.05%. In addition, three viral genomes were assembled and assigned to their hosts. The relative abundance of three Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, as well as three phages that infect them, changed dramatically over time. Genes possibly related to these shifts include those for resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, and phage. At the species level, we observed the decline of an early-colonizing Propionibacterium acnes strain similar to SK137 and the proliferation of novel Propionibacterium and Peptoniphilus species late in colonization. The Propionibacterium species differed in their ability to metabolize carbon compounds such as inositol and sialic acid, indicating that shifts in species composition likely impact the metabolic potential of the community. These results highlight the benefit of reconstructing complete genomes from metagenomic data and demonstrate methods for achieving this goal.
TI  - Bacteria on catheters in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peritonitis is the leading cause of morbidity for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and microbial biofilms have previously been identified on catheters from infected patients. However, few studies of catheters from patients without clinical signs of infection have been undertaken. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which bacteria are present on catheters from PD patients with no symptoms of infection. METHODS: Microbiologic culturing under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to determine the distribution of bacteria on PD catheters from 15 patients without clinical signs of infection and on catheters from 2 infected patients. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique was used to identify cultured bacteria. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected on 12 of the 15 catheters from patients without signs of infection and on the 2 catheters from infected patients. Single-species and mixed-microbial communities containing up to 5 species were present on both the inside and the outside along the whole length of the colonized catheters. The bacterial species most commonly found were the skin commensals Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, followed by S. warneri and S. lugdunensis. The strains of these micro-organisms, particularly those of S. epidermidis, varied in phenotype with respect to their tolerance of the major classes of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were common on catheters from patients without symptoms of infection. Up to 4 different bacterial species were found in close association and may represent a risk factor for the future development of peritonitis in patients hosting such micro-organisms.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of microbial strains isolated from Korean acne patients.
AB  - Over several decades, topical and systemic antibiotics have been the mainstay of  treatment for acne vulgaris. The widespread and long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne has resulted in the spread of resistant bacterial strains and treatment failure. We aimed to examine the bacteriology of acne vulgaris and to evaluate its susceptibility to the antibiotics widely used for acne in Korea. We examined the species of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from 100 Korean acne patients. Among the bacteria isolated, Staphylococcus epidermidis (36 patients) was the most common, followed by Propionibacterium acnes (30 patients). Eleven strains of P. acnes (36.7%) and 25 strains of S. epidermidis (69.4%) were resistant to one or other of the antibiotics tested. A higher proportion of P. acnes isolates were resistant to clindamycin (30%) and erythromycin (26.7%), than to any other antibiotics tested (P = 0.0003). Some S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline in addition to clindamycin and erythromycin. In the previous studies, few strains of P. acnes were found to be resistant to any of the antibiotics, but this study shows that antibiotic-resistant strains have been increasing in Korea acne patients.
TI  - Cardiovascular implantable electronic device endocarditis treated with daptomycin with or without transvenous removal.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Nine patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic  device (CIED) endocarditis were treated with daptomycin after the failure of previous treatment. The blood and CIED lead cultures of 1 patient were negative. In the other 8 patients, we observed 6 monomicrobic infections and 2 polymicrobic infections. Overall, 10 strains were isolated in these patients: 4 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus hominis, and 1 Propionibacterium acnes. The CIED was removed transvenously in 7 patients. Two patients were too sick for the removal of their CIED, and were cured with 6 mg/kg of daptomycin for 60 and 110 days, respectively, without adverse events. RESULTS: One patient died 4 days after the removal of his CIED because of a complicated abdominal aortic aneurysm. The other 8 patients were cured, with a mean follow-up of 17 +/- 8 months. The removed leads were negative, after daptomycin therapy, in 4 cases out of 7. The mean ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative strains was 38.3 +/- 18.5. For patients whose data were available, the ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 13.2 +/- 3.2. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin monotherapy may be a useful therapeutic tool in difficult-to-treat CIED endocarditis, resulting in a high rate of cures and sterilized leads removed. The ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and MIC or MBC may be useful as predictive tool for treatment success.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus reuteri on the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - While it is generally accepted that Propionibacterium acnes is involved in the development of acne, other bacteria including Staphylococcus epidermidis have also been isolated from the acne lesion. The interaction between Lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and acnegenic bacteria is unclear. This study examined the effects of L. reuteri on the proliferation of P. acnes and S. epidermidis. Human-derived L. reuteri strains (KCTC 3594 and KCTC 3678) and rat-derived L. reuteri KCTC 3679 were used. All strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of P. acnes and S. epidermidis. The proliferation of P. acnes was decreased by 2-log scales after incubation with L. reuteri for 24 h. In addition, the proliferation of S. epidermidis was decreased by 3-log scales after incubation with L. reuteri for 24 h, whereas the growth of L. reuteri was unaffected by P. acnes or S. epidermidis. Among the L. reuteri strains examined, L. reuteri KCTC 3679 had the strongest inhibitory effect on the growth of P. acnes and S. epidermidis, followed by L. reuteri KCTC 3594 and L. reuteri KCTC 3678. Interestingly, reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by L. reuteri KCTC 3594. The most pronounced the antibacterial activities of L. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids. Overall, these results suggest that L. reuteri may be a useful probiotic agent to control the growth of bacteria involved in acne inflammation and prevent acne.
TI  - The temporal dynamics of bacterial communities across human anterior nares.
AB  - The anterior nares (nostrils), are an important niche for bacterial colonization  by both commensals and opportunistic pathogens. Here the temporal dynamics and variation of the global nasal bacterial community across 25 healthy volunteers was evaluated over 15 months. Overall, there was a global seasonal shift in bacterial community structure. Such a temporal shift was also strongly evident in the abundances of species such as Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, such species dynamics over time was also inter-individual-dependent, and both individuals with highly stable communities and those with highly flexible communities could be defined. Even though the bacterial community of individual volunteers was thus generally variable over time and permanent carriage of a given species was seldomly observed, various species previously defined as constituting the core bacterial community could be identified as persistent in a subset of the volunteers suggesting that these same species also constitute to a 'temporal' core community.
TI  - Efficiency of diversion of the first aliquot of blood and prestorage leukoreduction for preventing bacterial contamination in red blood cell concentrates assessed using a rapid polymerase chain reaction-based bacterial detection system.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sepsis caused by the bacterial contamination of blood products is a major infection risk associated with blood transfusion. Diversion of the initial 25 mL of blood and prestorage leukoreduction were implemented in Japan in 2007 for all donated blood products. We assessed the efficacy of these new collection procedures in preventing bacterial contamination of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates. METHODS: Broad-range 16S ribosomal RNA polymerase chain reaction was used to determine bacterial contamination in segment samples of RBCs before and after implementation of the new collection procedures. To evaluate whether these new procedures reduced bacterial contamination, we compared bacterial contamination rates of blood samples from diversion pouches with those of segment samples from the same donor's RBCs. RESULTS: The rate of bacterial contamination of RBCs before implementation of the new collection procedures was 1.27%. Most of the isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes. After implementation, this rate was significantly reduced to 0.10%. Of the 233 whole blood samples obtained from the Mie Red Cross Blood Center, 1.72% of blood samples from diversion pouches were contaminated, but no bacterial contamination was detected in segment samples from the same donor's RBCs after prestorage leukoreduction. CONCLUSIONS: The new collection procedure significantly reduced bacterial contamination of RBC concentrates.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of seaweed extracts against acne inducing bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of common seaweeds from the coast of South Korea against the etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. Fifty-seven species of seaweed were screened for potential antimicrobial activity. Methanol extracts of 13 species (22.8%) showed inhibitory effects against Propionibacterium acnes. The aqueous extracts of only two species (3.5%) showed antimicrobial activity. When tested with the agar disk diffusion method, Ecklonia cava, E. kurome, Ishige sinicola, and Symphyocladia latiuscula had the strongest inhibitory effects. However, these four seaweed extracts showed no antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis at 5 mg disk-1. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of E. cava and E. kurome were both 0.31 mg ml-1 and the MIC values of l. sinicola and S. latiuscula were 0.26 and 0.21 mg ml-1, respectively. Among whole plants of E. cava and E. kurome, extracts of the pinnate blade had the highest inhibitory activity on bacterial growth. In cytotoxicity assays, methanol extracts of E. cava, E. kurome, and I. sinicola showed no effect on cell viability at concentrations of 200 microg ml-1. However, the methanol extracts of S. latiuscula reduced cell viability rates to 50% at the same concentration. Additionally, methanol extracts of E. cava, E. kurome, and I. sinicola potently inhibited the in vitro production of nitric oxide. These results suggest that the methanol extracts from these three species may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for acne vulgaris. Further investigations to determine the bioactive compound are in progress.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - Neolitsea aciculata essential oil inhibits drug-resistant skin pathogen growth and Propionibacterium acnes-induced inflammatory effects of human monocyte leukemia.
AB  - This study examined the chemical composition of Neolitsea aciculata essential oil (NAE) and its biological activities. NAE was obtained by hydro-distillation of N. aciculata leaves collected in Jeju Island and analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer detector. 1-Dodecen-3-yne (12.5%), calarene (11.5%) and elemol (9.5%) were identified as the major components of NAE. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of NAE against skin pathogens were examined to determine the protective properties against acne vulgaris. NAE exhibited moderate to strong antibacterial activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are known as acne-causing bacteria. In addition, NAE reduced the P. acnes-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in THP-1 cells, highlighting its anti-inflammatory effects. The DPPH radical scavenging activities of NAE also revealed moderate antioxidant properties (IC50, 21.3 microL/mL). Overall, NAE is an attractive candidate as an ingredient in skin care products.
TI  - The breast: a clean-contaminated surgical site.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Capsular contracture is one of the most common complications associated with breast implants. While the cause of this process has not yet been elucidated, subclinical infection is a likely culprit. OBJECTIVES: The authors assess the hypothesis that a probable source of contamination is endogenous breast bacteria, likely originating in the ducts themselves and most concentrated near the nipple. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy patients presenting for routine reduction mammaplasty were recruited as study participants. Tissue samples were taken intraoperatively from the periareolar, inframammary, and axillary regions of each sampled breast. Specimens were then processed in the microbiology laboratory, and quantitative bacterial counts were obtained. RESULTS: Of the 50 breasts sampled, 19 yielded positive culture results, for a rate of 38%. There was a significant difference in the positive culture rate among all three sites, with increasing quantitative bacterial counts in the axillary, inframammary, and periareolar regions, respectively. The most commonly-identified organisms in this study included various species of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium acnes, with S. epidermidis being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: The breast harbors significant endogenous bacteria that can become the source of spontaneous or postoperative infection. Positive intraoperative cultures with high quantitative counts suggest that breast tissue harbors more bacteria than normal skin flora. Routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be suboptimal for the prevention of foreign body seeding in this setting. Furthermore, bacterial concentrations are highest in areas with the most ductal tissue, namely the periareolar region. These findings may be helpful when considering which incision site to select for augmentation mammaplasty.
TI  - Cathelicidin-BF, a snake cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide, could be an  excellent therapeutic agent for acne vulgaris.
AB  - Cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides acting as multifunctional effector molecules in innate immunity. Cathelicidin-BF has been purified from the snake venoms of Bungarus fasciatus and it is the first identified cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide in reptiles. In this study, cathelicidin-BF was found exerting strong antibacterial activities against Propionibacterium acnes. Its minimal inhibitory concentration against two strains of P. acnes was 4.7 microg/ml. Cathelicidin-BF also effectively killed other microorganisms including Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was possible pathogen for acne vulgaris. Cathelicidin-BF significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory factors secretion in human monocytic cells and P. acnes-induced O2.- production of human HaCaT keratinocyte cells. Observed by scanning electron microscopy, the surfaces of the treated pathogens underwent obvious morphological changes compared with the untreated controls, suggesting that this antimicrobial peptide exerts its action by disrupting membranes of microorganisms. The efficacy of cathelicidin-BF gel topical administering was evaluated in experimental mice skin colonization model. In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of cathelicidin-BF were confirmed by relieving P. acnes-induced mice ear swelling and granulomatous inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects combined with potent antimicrobial activities and O2.- production inhibition activities of cathelicidin-BF indicate its potential as a novel therapeutic option for acne vulgaris.
TI  - Clinical effectiveness of once-daily levofloxacin for inflammatory acne with high concentrations in the lesions.

TI  - Infection after shoulder surgery.
AB  - Infection after shoulder surgery is rare but potentially devastating. Normal skin flora, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes, are the most commonly isolated pathogens. Perioperative measures to prevent infection are of paramount importance, and clinical acumen is necessary for diagnosis. Superficial infections may be managed with local wound measures and antibiotics; deep infections require surgical debridement in combination with antibiotic treatment. Treating physicians must make difficult decisions regarding antibiotic duration and the elimination of the offending organisms by resection arthroplasty, direct implant exchange, or staged revision arthroplasty. Eradication of a deep infection is usually successful, but the course of treatment is often protracted, and tissue destruction and scar may adversely affect functional outcome.
TI  - Deep brain stimulation hardware-related infections: a report of 12 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - In this monocentric study, the median delay between deep brain stimulation implantation and infection was 28 days (range, 8-820). Infections limited to generator (n = 4) required partial hardware removal, whereas infections involving frontal or retroauricular sites (n = 7) required total removal. Surgical samples yielded Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes, and Micrococcus species.
TI  - Impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. However, with the exception of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. METHODS: We cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with THP-1 monocyte-like cells. We performed 16S rDNA analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether THP-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. RESULTS: We recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with THP-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. On average, tissue homogenates incubated with THP-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (P = 0.02). We recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qPCR demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) P. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. Our results suggest revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.
TI  - Detection of microbial contaminants in mammalian cell cultures using a new fluorescence-based staining method.
AB  - AIMS: Microbial contamination of cell culture production processes is a current concern for biopharmaceutical industries. Traditional testing methods require several days to detect contamination and may advantageously be replaced by a rapid detection method. We developed a new method combining membrane filtration to microcolonies fluorescence staining method (MFSM) and compared it to epifluorescence microscopy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both methods were used to detect bacteria in CHO cells cultures. The epifluorescence microscopy showed to be limited by filterability, media interference and nonrobustness issues, whereas MFSM enabled consistent detection of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes after, respectively, 8, 9 and 48 h of incubation. Thanks to the nondestructive feature of the MFSM, stained membranes could be reincubated on culture media to yield visible colonies used for identification. CONCLUSIONS: The new method described in this study showed its ability to detect microbial contaminants in cell culture samples with time-to-results from 2-5 times shorter than the traditional testing method. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The MFSM can be used as monitoring tool for cell cultures to significantly shorten detection times of microbial contamination, while preserving the ability to identify the contaminants and their viability.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of needles used for intravitreal injections: a prospective, multicenter study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of bacterial contamination of needles used for intravitreal injections. METHODS: Patients undergoing intravitreal injections were enrolled prospectively. No pre-injection antibiotics were administered. Following povidone-iodine irrigation, conjunctival cultures were taken and the injection was performed. The needle was cultured. A dry control needle was exposed to the surgical field and cultured. RESULTS: No patients developed endophthalmitis. Eighteen injection needles (18%) yielded positive bacterial growth. The most commonly encountered organisms were Propionibacterium acnes (n = 8) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6). Four control needles showed positive growth, in 2 cases with the same organism as a matching positive used needle. The difference between contamination rates of used and control needles was significant (p = .002, McNemar's test). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial contaminants are present on a substantial proportion of needles. Since the needle contacts both the ocular surface and the vitreous, it is possible that inoculation of the vitreous cavity occurs in such cases.
TI  - [Evaluating post-cataract surgery changes in bacterial culture tests with and without face-washing].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the changes in conjunctiva and eyelid culture test results before and after cataract surgery and their relation to face-washing. METHODS: 70 patients (109 eyes) who had cataract surgery at Nishi-Kobe Medical Center had conjunctiva and eyelid smears taken both preoperatively and postoperatively. They had cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and aspiration followed by intraocular lens implantation. The patients were separated into two groups. The Face-Washing group started to wash their faces on the day after the operation (POD 1). The Non Face-Washing group started to wash their faces two days after the operation (POD2). We compared the results of the Face-Washing group and the Non Face-Washing group. RESULTS: The percentage of culture-positive organisms in both the conjunctivae and eyelids dropped significantly postoperatively. In the conjunctivae, there were a few bacteria postoperatively, but in the eyelids, there were many Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) postoperatively. Only in the Non Face-Washing group, the number of S. epidermidis and P. acnes at POD2 increased significantly compared with POD1. CONCLUSION: There are S. epidermidis and P. acnes deep in the skin (hair follicle), so S. epidermidis and P. acnes can still be detected postoperatively. Postoperative face-washing may prove effective in keeping the eyelids clean.
TI  - Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from refractory endodontic lesions are opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - The predominant cultivable microbiota from 20 refractory endodontic lesions (9 with abscesses and 11 without abscesses) were determined, and Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis were among the most predominant organisms. The number of species identified from lesions with abscesses (14.1 +/- 2.6) was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than the number from lesions without abscesses (7.4 +/- 5.9). Comparison of perioral isolates using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR of the same species from the same subjects demonstrated that the endodontic and skin populations were significantly different. The P. acnes isolates were typed on the basis of recA gene sequence comparison, and only three types (types I, II, and III) were identified among 125 isolates examined. However, we found that type I (type IA and IB) isolates were primarily isolated from the skin, while types II and III were significantly more likely to be isolated from the endodontic lesions (P < 10(-10)). We found that the robustness of the recA phylotypes was not strong by comparing the partial gene sequences of six putative virulence determinants, PAmce, PAp60, PA-25957, PA-5541, PA-21293, and PA-4687. The resulting neighbor-joining trees were incongruent, and significant (phi test; P = 2.2 x 10(-7)) evidence of recombination was demonstrated, with significant phylogenetic heterogeneity being apparent within the clusters. P. acnes and S. epidermidis isolated from refractory endodontic infections, with or without periapical abscesses, are likely to be nosocomial infections.
TI  - Infected Rathke cleft cysts: distinguishing factors and factors predicting recurrence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rathke cleft cysts (RCCs) are benign sellar lesions that are generally asymptomatic but sometimes warrant transsphenoidal drainage. Small case reports have described infected RCCs, but this phenomenon remains uncharacterized. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed RCCs over 23 years at our institution to determine factors predicting infection and recurrence. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the magnetic resonance images, laboratory results, microbiology, and pathology of 176 RCC patients (1985-2008) who underwent initial operation at our institution (n = 170) or at another institution followed by recurrence managed at our institution (n = 6). RESULTS: There were 3 RCC categories: cysts cultured intraoperatively during initial surgery (n = 21), cysts not cultured during initial surgery but cultured during subsequent surgery (n = 9), and cysts that were never cultured (n = 146). Cultured cysts were larger (1.6 vs 1.2 cm; P = .002) and had more frequent pituitary dysfunction (76% vs 30%; P < .001) than noncultured cysts. Restricted diffusion was also more common in cultured cysts (50% vs 0%; P = .02). Of cysts cultured at initial or subsequent surgery, 48% and 44%, respectively, had positive cultures (n = 14) and were treated with antibiotics. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (64%) and Propionibacterium acnes (57%). Kaplan-Meier recurrence rates were 13% (culture positive/antibiotic treated), 31% (culture negative/not antibiotic treated), and 9% (noncultured) (P = .002, cultured vs noncultured; P = .002, culture negative/not antibiotic treated vs non-cultured; P = .5 culture positive/antibiotic treated vs noncultured). CONCLUSION: Suspected RCC infection, regardless of culture results, is a strong predictor of recurrence and may warrant antibiotic treatment. With antibiotic treatment, the recurrence rate of infected RCC approaches that of noninfected cysts. The higher recurrence rates reported in other series may reflect underrecognition of occult infection.
TI  - Free radical scavenging and anti-acne activities of mangosteen fruit rind extracts prepared by different extraction methods.
AB  - The ethanol extracts of mangosteen fruit rinds prepared by several extraction methods were examined for their contents of bioactive compounds, DPPH-scavenging activity, and anti-acne producing bacteria against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The dried powder of the fruit rind was extracted with 95% ethanol by maceration, percolation, Soxhlet extraction, ultrasonic extraction, and extraction using a magnetic stirrer. Soxhlet extraction promoted the maximum contents of crude extract (26.60% dry weight) and alpha-mangostin (13.51%, w/w of crude extract), and also gave the highest anti-acne activity with MIC 7.81 and 15.63 microg/mL and MBC 15.53 and 31.25 microg/mL against P. acnes and S. epidermidis, respectively. Ethanol 70% and 50% (v/v) were also compared in Soxhlet extraction. Ethanol 50% promoted the extract with maximum amounts of total phenolic compounds (26.96 g gallic acid equivalents/100 g extract) and total tannins (46.83 g tannic acid equivalents/100 g extract), and also exhibited the most effective DPPH-scavenging activity (EC(50) 12.84 microg/mL). Considering various factors involved in the process, Soxhlet extraction carried a low cost in terms of reagents and extraction time. It appears to be the recommended extraction method for mangosteen fruit rind. Ethanol 50% should be the appropriate solvent for extracting free radical-scavenging components, phenolic compounds, and tannins, while 95% ethanol is recommended for extraction of alpha-mangostin, a major anti-acne component from this plant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thai herbal extracts on acne involved microorganism.
AB  - Ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of 18 Thai medicinal plants were investigated for their antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes, Stapylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis. Thirteen plant extracts were capable of inhibiting the growth of P. acnes and S. epidermidis, while 14 plant extracts exhibited an inhibitory effect on S. aureus. Based on the broth dilution method, the ethyl acetate extract of Alpinia galanga (L.) Wild. (Zingiberaceae) rhizome showed the strongest antibacterial effect against P. acnes, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 156.0 and 312.0 microg/mL, respectively. On the basis of bioassay-guided purification, the ethyl acetate extract was isolated to afford the antibacterial active compound, which was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (1'-ACA). 1'-ACA had a strong inhibitory effect on P. acnes with MIC and MBC values of 62.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively. Thus, 1'-ACA was used as an indicative marker for standardization of A. galanga extract using high performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that A. galanga extract could be an interesting agent for further studies on an alternative treatment of acne.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Anti-acne-inducing bacterial activity of mangosteen fruit rind extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to determine the most effective solvent extract of mangosteen, anti-acne- inducing bacterial activity and the amount of alpha-mangostin, a major active component in each mangosteen fruit rind extract, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fruit rinds of mangosteen were extracted with hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and water. The extracts were tested for antibacterial activity against bacteria that induce acne, including Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Thin-layer chromatographic autobiography against these bacteria was also performed for each extract, while the alpha-mangostin content was analyzed using a validated HPLC method. RESULTS: The dichloromethane extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial effect with minimum inhibitory concentration values for both bacterial species at 3.91 microg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentration values against P. acnes and S. epidermidis were 3.91 and 15.63 microg/ml, respectively. Thin-layer chromatographic autobiography indicated that alpha-mangostin was present in all extracts, except the water extract, and is a major active component against both P. acnes and S. epidermidis. Using HPLC, the dichloromethane extract yielded the highest content (46.21% w/w) of alpha-mangostin followed by the ethanol extract (18.03% w/w), the hexane extract (17.21% w/w) and the water extract (0.54% w/w). CONCLUSIONS: Dichloromethane extract exhibited the strongest anti-acne-inducing bacterial effect and this extract yielded the highest amount of alpha-mangostin.
TI  - The human nasal microbiota and Staphylococcus aureus carriage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonization of humans with Staphylococcus aureus is a critical prerequisite of subsequent clinical infection of the skin, blood, lung, heart and other deep tissues. S. aureus persistently or intermittently colonizes the nares of approximately 50% of healthy adults, whereas approximately 50% of the general population is rarely or never colonized by this pathogen. Because microbial consortia within the nasal cavity may be an important determinant of S. aureus colonization we determined the composition and dynamics of the nasal microbiota and correlated specific microorganisms with S. aureus colonization. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nasal specimens were collected longitudinally from five healthy adults and a cross-section of hospitalized patients (26 S. aureus carriers and 16 non-carriers). Culture-independent analysis of 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the nasal microbiota of healthy subjects consists primarily of members of the phylum Actinobacteria (e.g., Propionibacterium spp. and Corynebacterium spp.), with proportionally less representation of other phyla, including Firmicutes (e.g., Staphylococcus spp.) and Proteobacteria (e.g. Enterobacter spp). In contrast, inpatient nasal microbiotas were enriched in S. aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis and diminished in several actinobacterial groups, most notably Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, within the inpatient population S. aureus colonization was negatively correlated with the abundances of several microbial groups, including S. epidermidis (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The nares environment is colonized by a temporally stable microbiota that is distinct from other regions of the integument. Negative association between S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and other groups suggests microbial competition during colonization of the nares, a finding that could be exploited to limit S. aureus colonization.
TI  - Heart valve allograft decontamination with antibiotics: impact of the temperature of incubation on efficacy.
AB  - Heart valve allografts are typically processed at 4 degrees C in North America, including the step of antibiotic decontamination. In our own experience with heart valve banking, we often observe persistent positive cultures following decontamination at wet ice temperature. We hypothesized that warmer temperatures of incubation might increase the efficacy of the decontamination procedure. In a first series of experiments, 12 different bacterial species were grown overnight, frozen in standardized aliquots and used directly to inoculate antibiotic cocktail aliquots at 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. The antibiotic cocktail contains vancomycin (50 mug/ml), gentamicin (80 mug/ml) and cefoxitin (240 mug/ml) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium. Inoculated aliquots were incubated at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C and CFUs were determined at regular intervals up to 24 h post-inoculation. In a second set of experiments, 10 heart valves were spiked with 5000 CFU/ml and incubated with antibiotics at 4 and 37 degrees C for 24 h. The final rinse solutions of these heart valves were filtered and tested for bacterial growth. After 24 h of incubation, CFUs of all 12 bacterial species were reduced by a factor of only one to two logs at 4 degrees C whereas log reductions of 3.7 and 5.0 or higher were obtained at 22 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Most microorganisms, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactococcus lactis lactis and Propionibacterium acnes survived well the 24-h antibiotic treatment at 4 degrees C (< 1 Log reduction). All 10 heart valves that were spiked with microorganisms had positive final rinse solutions after antibiotic soaking at 4 degrees C, whereas 8 out of 10 cultures were negative when antibiotic decontamination was done at 37 degrees C. These experiments show that a wet ice temperature greatly reduces the efficacy of the allograft decontamination process as microorganisms survived well to a 24-h 4 degrees C antibiotic treatment. This could explain the high rate of positive post-processing cultures obtained with our routine tissue decontamination procedure. Increasing the decontamination temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C may significantly reduce the incidence of post-disinfection bacterial contamination of heart valves.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of Fortunella japonica var. margarita and Citrus sunki essential oils on nitric oxide production and skin pathogens.
AB  - A number of essential oils from citrus peels are claimed to have biological activities. Citrus peel, called 'Jin-Pi', is used in traditional medicine for digestion, severe cold, and fever. However, the antibacterial activities against skin pathogens and anti-inflammatory effects of the essential oils of Citrus sunki (JinGyul) and Fortunella japonica var. margarita (GumGyul) have not yet been described. Therefore, in this study, the essential oils of the citrus species C. sunki (CSE) and F. japonica var. margarita (FJE), both native to the island of Jeju, Korea, were examined for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities against skin pathogens. Four human skin pathogenic microorganisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCARM 3709, Propionibacterium acnes CCARM 0081, Malassezia furfur KCCM 12679, and Candida albicans KCCM 11282, were studied. CSE and FJE exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria and yeast strains that were tested. Interestingly, CSE and FJE even showed antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant S. epidermidis CCARM 3710, S. epidermidis CCARM 3711, P. acnes CCARM9009, and P. acnes CCARM9010 strains. In addition, CSE and FJE reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that they have anti-inflammatory effects. We also analysed the chemical composition of the oils by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identified several major components, including dl-limonene (68.18%) and beta-myrcene (4.36%) for CSE, and dl-limonene (61.58%) and carvone (6.36%) for FJE. Taken together, these findings indicate that CSE and FJE have great potential to be used in human skin health applications.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Propionibacterium acnes. Non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. Two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tK100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. High and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/mL) were used. Silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. RESULTS: The silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tK100 assay at high inoculum. At low inoculum S. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against E. coli but without complete eradication. MRSA was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. The in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. Silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. CONCLUSIONS: The commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate MRSA or E. coli and while it showed activity against S. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. This is consistent with clinical studies on silver-processed catheters.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  - Rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus (RRn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. In this study, antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract as well as rhinacanthin-C against Streptococcus mutans, Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. It was found that the RRn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against S. mutans with MIC and MBC of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against S. epidermidis, P. acnes and S. aureus with the MICs of 8-16 microg/ml. However, the RRn extract was not active against C. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-C. Stability evaluations of the RRn extract through a period of 4 months found that the RRn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees C or 30+/-2 degrees C. The RRn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. Under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees C with 75% relative humidity, the RRn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. Study on the effect of pH on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the RRn extract found that the solutions were not stable at pH 5.5, pH 7.0, and pH 8.0. However, the rhinacanthin solution at pH 5.5 was more stable than those at pH 7.0 and pH 8.0.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial flora in persistent apical periodontitis lesions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection  in periapical tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the microflora of persistent apical periodontitis lesions. METHODS: Twenty apical lesion samples were obtained from 20 patients with chronic apical periodontitis by root end surgery and processed using aerobic or anaerobic culture techniques. All isolated strains were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four strains were isolated, belonging to 31 bacterial species obtained from the 20 apical lesions that were isolated. The majority of the strains were facultative anaerobes (51.6%). Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from 16.2, 9.5, 6.8 and 5.4% of the samples, respectively. Fifteen samples harboured more than one species. The predominant association was P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: The microbiota of persistent apical periodontitis lesions is composed by diverse types of microorganisms with biofilm-forming capacity, including P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fullerenes and their hydroxylated derivatives.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of fullerene C60 and its derivatives against 6 kinds of bacteria and 2 kinds of fungi were evaluated. The tested samples were water-soluble fullerenes (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/C60, gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD)/C60, and nano-C60) and 3 types of fullerenols (C60(OH)12, C60(OH)36.8H2O, and C60(OH)44.8H2O). Their activities were compared with those of (+)-catechin and hinokitiol from the viewpoint of future application to cosmetics. Although pristine C60 demonstrated no antimicrobial activity, fullerenols exhibited good antimicrobial activity against Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Malassezia furfur. In particular, C60(OH)44 exhibited a strong and wide-ranging antimicrobial activity comparable to that of catechin. This compound exhibits antimicrobial activity via inhibition of microbial cell growth and not via bactericidal activity.
TI  - Sterilization of platelet concentrates at production scale by irradiation with short-wave ultraviolet light.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) is recognized  as a serious threat to transfusion safety. We developed a simple method for sterilization of PCs with short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC). The effects of treatment on the sterility of contaminated PCs and in vitro platelet (PLT) variables were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were prepared from pools of five buffy coats. Irradiation with UVC (wavelength, 254 nm) under vigorous agitation was from both sides of the irradiation bags. Kinetics of the inactivation of Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined. PCs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of 10 bacteria species (n = 12/species) were irradiated with UVC doses between 0.25 and 0.4 J/cm(2) and tested for sterility by a commercially available bacterial detection system (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux) after storage at 22 degrees C for 3 or 6 days. The influence of a dose of 0.3 J/cm(2) on PLT variables was investigated on Days 1, 4, and 6 after irradiation. RESULTS: At 0.3 J/cm(2) all bacteria species tested were inactivated by more than 4 log. At this dose the influence of UVC on in vitro PLT variables was marginal; the storage stability for up to 6 days after treatment was maintained. PCs spiked with approximately 10 to 100 CFUs/mL were reproducibly sterilized in the dose range tested. In individual experiments with the spore former B. cereus, PCs were, however, unsterile after treatment. CONCLUSION: Irradiation at UVC doses not detrimental to in vitro PLT variables sterilizes PCs contaminated with a wide range of different bacteria species.
TI  - Screening of platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination: spectrum of bacteria detected, proportion of transfused units, and clinical follow-up.
AB  - Screening of platelet concentrates (PCs) for bacterial contamination with cultivation methods is carried out as a routine procedure in some countries. The aim is to prevent the transfusion of contaminated PCs. The German Evaluation of Regular Monitoring Study Group conducted a prospective multicenter study on 52,243 PCs to investigate the prevalence of bacteria (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). This study describes the detected bacterial spectrum, the proportion of PCs with a positive test result that had been transfused, and the results of the clinical follow-up. One hundred thirteen (67%) of 169 potentially or confirmed positive units had already been transfused at the time of the first positive signal. The transfusion of units contaminated by Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and 73% of the units contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, or Staphylococcus saccharolyticus was prevented. In contrast, 85% of units with Propionibacterium acnes were transfused. A clonal relationship of the isolates from the pooled PCs and from the associated red blood cell concentrates was found in all investigated cases. The follow-up revealed six febrile reactions to culture-positive PCs not classified as transfusion reaction (TRs) by treating physicians. This demonstrates the importance of hemovigilance. Serious septic reactions due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two units of one apheresis PC that had tested false-negative were reported; one had a fatal outcome. Culture systems reduce the risk of transfusion of contaminated PCs but cannot guarantee sterility. Physicians must be aware of bacterial contamination of PCs as a potential cause of TRs and must report all adverse events.
TI  - Cryptomeria japonica essential oil inhibits the growth of drug-resistant skin pathogens and LPS-induced nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  - In this study, the chemical composition of Cryptomeria japonica essential oil (CJE) was analyzed and its biological activities were tested. CJE was obtained by steam distillation from leaves collected from Jeju Island and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detection (FID) and GC-MS. Kaurene (17.20%), elemol (10.88%), gamma-eudesmol (9.41%), and sabinene (8.86%) were the major components in CJE. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of CJE against drug-susceptible and -resistant skin pathogens have been not reported previously. Thus, we determined the anti-bacterial activities of CJE using the disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. CJE showed excellent antibacterial activities against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are acne-causing bacteria. The MIC of CJE against drug-susceptible and -resistant P. acens and S. epidermidis ranged from 0.16 to 10.0 microl/ml. In addition, the effects of CJE on nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages were also examined. Pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator tests indicated that CJE has excellent dose-dependent inhibitory activities. Therefore, based on these results, we propose that CJE is an attractive acne-mitigating candidate for skin health.
TI  - Sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. In these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. Consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. Using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. METHODS: Discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Propionibacterium acnes in Mueller Hinton broth. Non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (A) sonication of the discs, (B) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (C) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (D) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. Quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. RESULTS: With the exception of S. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. The scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. INTERPRETATION: Scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Antimicrobial property of lauric acid against Propionibacterium acnes: its therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  - The strong bactericidal properties of lauric acid (C12:0), a middle chain-free fatty acid commonly found in natural products, have been shown in a number of studies. However, it has not been demonstrated whether lauric acid can be used for acne treatment as a natural antibiotic against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), which promotes follicular inflammation (inflammatory acne). This study evaluated the antimicrobial property of lauric acid against P. acnes both in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of the skin bacteria P. acnes, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) with lauric acid yielded minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against the bacterial growth over 15 times lower than those of benzoyl peroxide (BPO). The lower MIC values of lauric acid indicate stronger antimicrobial properties than that of BPO. The detected values of half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of lauric acid on P. acnes, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis growth indicate that P. acnes is the most sensitive to lauric acid among these bacteria. In addition, lauric acid did not induce cytotoxicity to human sebocytes. Notably, both intradermal injection and epicutaneous application of lauric acid effectively decreased the number of P. acnes colonized with mouse ears, thereby relieving P. acnes-induced ear swelling and granulomatous inflammation. The obtained data highlight the potential of using lauric acid as an alternative treatment for antibiotic therapy of acne vulgaris.
TI  - Abies koreana essential oil inhibits drug-resistant skin pathogen growth and LPS-induced inflammatory effects of murine macrophage.
AB  - Since acne vulgaris is the combined result of a bacterial infection and the inflammatory response to that infection, we examined whether Abies koreana essential oil (AKE) possessed anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities against skin pathogens. In this study, AKE showed excellent antibacterial activities against drug-susceptible and -resistant Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are acne-causing bacteria. In addition, AKE reduced the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, NO and PGE(2) in RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that it has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we suggest that AKE may be an attractive candidate for promoting skin health.
TI  - Acute-onset nosocomial endophthalmitis after cataract surgery: incidence, clinical features, causative organisms, and visual outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the incidence of acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract  surgery and to report its clinical features, microbiology, and final visual outcomes. SETTING: King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery was 0.068%: 0.049% for extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and 0.085% for clear corneal phacoemulsification (P = .268). The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.053% during the first 5 years of the study and 0.08% during the next 5 years. The most common presenting features were pain and poor red reflex. Of the 20 cases, 18 were culture positive. The culture isolates showed Staphylococcus species in 7 eyes (35%), Streptococcus species in 7 eyes (35%), polymicrobial or mixed infections in 3 eyes (15%), and Propionibacterium acnes in 1 eye (5%). Two patients (10%) achieved a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, 5 (25%) had worse than 20/40 to better than 20/200, and 8 (40%) had worse than 20/200; 5 eyes (25%) were eviscerated. Visual outcomes were good in endophthalmitis cases after phacoemulsification and in cases caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and worse in cases that had Streptococcus species endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Clear corneal phacoemulsification had a 1.73-fold higher risk for acute endophthalmitis than ECCE. Although the incidence of endophthalmitis after ECCE was lower than after phacoemulsification, the outcome was much worse in post-ECCE endophthalmitis cases. Poor visual outcomes were associated with more virulent organisms and delayed presentation.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial, anticollagenase, and antioxidant activities of hop components (Humulus lupulus) addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  - Seven naturally derived components from hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) extracts were tested for evaluation of biological activities affecting acne vulgaris. Five strains, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria rhizophila and, Staphylococcus pyogenes, were selected as the main acne-causing bacteria. Hop extracts xanthohumol and the lupulones showed strong inhibitory activities against all of the strains. Although hydrogenated derivatives did not show the same level of activity, naturally occurring xanthohumol, humulones, and lupulones all showed moderate to strong anticollagenase inhibitory activities. Antioxidant capacity was also evaluated with seven different methods based on different reactive oxygen species. Xanthohumol showed the highest activity in total oxygen radical absorbance capacity as well as singlet oxygen absorbance capacity.
TI  - In vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  - Camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. Green tea extract-4 (CSI-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. It showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL. CSI-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the IC(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/mL. It exhibited the highest activity against P. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CSI-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of nadifloxacin against several Gram-positive bacteria and analysis of the possible evolution of resistance after 2 years of use in Germany.
AB  - Nadifloxacin has good activity against Propionibacterium acnes as well as against both meticillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively) and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of this fluoroquinolone against the abovementioned microorganisms, comparing isolates collected in 2007 in Germany, a country where nadifloxacin has been used for the last 2 years, with isolates collected from 2006-2007 in Spain where nadifloxacin has not been used. A collection of P. acnes from Hungary (strains collected during 2005-2006) and a collection of P. acnes from different countries in Europe (collected during 2002) were also included. The activity of nadifloxacin was compared with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Susceptibility testing of P. acnes was performed by agar dilution, whereas the susceptibility of the different staphylococci was determined by microdilution. Although the isolates were collected from three different countries (Spain, Hungary and Germany) where the use of quinolones can produce a different effect, no significant differences in the percentages of resistance to nadifloxacin were observed in P. acnes, MSSA, MRSA and S. epidermidis. Therefore, topical antibiotics such as nadifloxacin do not have an additional effect on resistance. Moreover, nadifloxacin presented much better activity than the comparator drugs used in this study against the studied microorganisms.
TI  - No evidence for presence of bacteria in modic type I changes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest an association between sciatica and Propionibacterium acnes. "Modic type I changes" in the vertebrae are closely associated with sciatica and lower back pain, and recent studies have questioned the ability of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate between degenerative Modic type I changes and vertebral abnormalities caused by infection. PURPOSE: To test whether bacteria could be cultured from biopsies of Modic type I changes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with Modic type I changes in lumbar vertebrae had a biopsy taken from the affected vertebra by a strict aseptic procedure. The biopsy was split into two specimens, which were inoculated into thioglycolate agar tubes in the surgical theatre and transported to the microbiology laboratory. In the laboratory, one specimen was streaked onto plates and analyzed for anaerobic and aerobic culture. The other tube was left unopened and incubated directly. Plates and tubes were incubated for 2 weeks and observed for visible growth. RESULTS: None of the biopsies yielded growth of anaerobic bacteria. In one patient, both biopsies yielded growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and in another patient coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from one biopsy. Both patients received oral antibiotics without convincing effect on symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our results showed no evidence of bacteria in vertebrae with Modic type I changes. The isolation of staphylococci from two patients probably represented contamination.
TI  - Assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  - In contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. The objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. Samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. Several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. Staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. One representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Among the 48 S. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icaD gene and the mecA gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. In parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cylA, vanA, vanB, vanD, vanE and vanG genes. All of them were sensitive to vancomycin. There were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.
TI  - Biological activities of Korean Citrus obovoides and Citrus natsudaidai essential oils against acne-inducing bacteria.
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the chemical composition of Citrus obovoides (Geumgamja) and Citrus natsudaidai (Cheonyahagyul) oils and to test their biological activities. These citrus essential oils were obtained by steam distillation of fruits collected from Jeju Island, Korea, and were analyzed using gas chromatograph (GC)-flame ionization detectors (FID) and GC-MS. Limonene and gamma-terpinene were the major components of the two citrus species. To evaluate in vitro anti-acne activity, they were tested against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are involved in acne. The Geumgamja and Cheonyahagyul oils exhibited antibacterial activity against both P. acnes and S. epidermidis. Their effects on DPPH radical scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, and nitric oxide radical were also assessed. Cheonyahagyul and Geumgamja exhibited only superoxide anion radical-scavenging activity. To assess their potential usefulness in future cosmetic product applications, the cytotoxic effects of the two oils were determined by colorimetric MTT assays using two animal cell lines: normal human fibroblasts and HaCaT cells. They exhibited low cytotoxicity at 0.1 microl/ml in both cell lines. In addition, they reduced P. acnes-induced secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in THP-1 cells, an indication of anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, based on these results, we suggest that Geumgamja and Cheonyahagyul essential oils are attractive acne-mitigating candidates for topical application.
TI  - Air-borne microbial contamination of surfaces in a UK dental clinic.
AB  - Little is known about the number, type, or antibiotic resistance profiles, of air-borne microbes present in hospital settings yet such information is important in designing effective measures to reduce cross-infection. In this study settle plates were used to identify and quantify the air-borne microbes present in a dental clinic. All isolates were identified to species level using partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and their susceptibility to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin, tetracycline or vancomycin was performed. The mean numbers of viable bacteria detected for each sampling occasion during periods of clinical activity and in the absence of such activity were 21.9 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h and 2.3 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h respectively. One hundred ninety-three distinct colony morphotypes, comprising 73 species, were isolated during the study and 48% of these were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The mean numbers of different morphotypes detected per sampling occasion were 14.3 and 5 during periods of clinical activity and inactivity respectively. Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated regardless of whether any clinical activities were taking place. These findings highlight the importance of preventing surfaces from becoming reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and thereby contributing to cross-infection in the dental clinic.
TI  - Acne is not associated with yet-uncultured bacteria.
AB  - Current clinical and microbiological information on acne fails to demonstrate a clear association between particular species, including Propionibacterium acnes, and disease, and the disease continues to be a considerable problem. To test if acne is associated with hitherto uncultured bacteria residing in diseased skin follicles, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of approximately 5,700 amplified and cloned 16S rRNA genes were used to determine the microbial diversity in follicles from acne patients and healthy individuals and from the superficial skin of acne patients. Follicles from healthy skin were exclusively colonized by P. acnes, whereas the follicular microbiota of acne patients included, in addition, Staphylococcus epidermidis and minor proportions of other species. In comparison, samples from superficial skin showed a complex microbiota represented by 12 to 16 bacterial species. The findings of the study exclude the possibility that acne is associated with yet-uncultured bacteria and shows that healthy skin follicles constitute a remarkably exclusive habitat allowing colonization only by P. acnes.
TI  - Monitoring the physiologic stress response: a novel biophysical approach for the  rapid detection of bacteria in platelet concentrate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrates (PCs) require an extended period of time to obtain results. A new approach based on the monitoring of the bacterial response to physiologic stress is presented. Because the stress response is independent of the growth rate, decisive results can be obtained in near real time. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PCs were spiked with Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli organisms commonly implicated in posttransfusion septic reactions. All suspensions were treated with Triton X-100 at concentrations that caused human cell lysis while acting as a stressor for bacterial cells. Normalized impedance response (NIR) profiles of these suspensions were recorded using the BioSense Technologies differential impedance sensing platform specifically designed to monitor subtle changes in the dielectric properties of biologic suspensions. Further development of the approach included measurement of NIRs for spiked PCs treated with nonlysing chemical stressors. RESULTS: NIR profiles for bacteria conventionally growing under optimal conditions were characterized by an overall increase in the NIR values. In contrast, the corresponding responses from chemically stressed bacteria revealed immediate and continuous decreases in value-enabling bacterial detection in less than 30 minutes. CONCLUSION: These pilot experiments demonstrated that monitoring of the bacterial stress response is a fast and effective way to detect bacteria in PCs. In addition, special culture conditions are not required for detecting anaerobes and fastidious species.
TI  - Preoperative disinfection of the conjunctival sac with antibiotics and iodine compounds: a prospective randomized multicenter study.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare disinfection by povidone-iodine (PI) solution with that by polyvinyl alcohol-iodine (PAI) solution in preoperative eyewash and to assess the optimal duration of the preoperative application of 0.5% levofloxacin (LVFX) ophthalmic solution. METHODS: Two-hundred-seventy-two elderly cataract patients who had undergone phacoemulsification aspiration with intraocular lens insertion at 12 clinical facilities in Japan were randomized into three groups: 3-day, 1-day, and 1-h preoperative application of 0.5% LVFX ophthalmic solution. Each LVFX group was further divided into two subgroups; the patients in one subgroup were treated with diluted PI eyewash, and those in the second subgroup with diluted PAI eyewash, immediately before the surgery. Thus, a total of six groups were studied. Conjunctival scrapings were collected four times: before LVFX application, after LVFX application, after the eyewash with iodine compounds, and after the surgery. Samples of the aqueous humor were collected immediately after the surgery. All samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. RESULTS: The 3-day application of LVFX had a significantly higher disinfection rate than the 1-day or 1-h applications (P<0.05). The disinfection rate of PI was 78.0%, and that of PAI was 79.4%; PAI was not inferior to PI as a preoperative disinfectant. However, new isolates, mainly Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected after LVFX application and even after use of the eyewash with iodine compounds. CONCLUSION: Three-day administration of LVFX ophthalmic solution and use of an eyewash with diluted iodine compounds is effective for preoperative disinfection. However, complete elimination of bacteria from the conjunctival sac is difficult.
TI  - Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of Jeju medicinal plants against acne-inducing bacteria.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis are pus-forming bacteria that trigger inflammation in acne. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of Jeju medicinal plants against these etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. Ethanol extracts of Jeju plants were tested for antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The results from the disc diffusion assays revealed that four medicinal plants, Mollugo pentaphylla, Angelica anomala, Matteuccia orientalis, and Orixa japonica inhibited the growth of both pathogens. Among these, A. anomala had strong inhibitory effects. Its MIC values were 15.6 microg/ml and 125 microg/ml against P. acnes and S. epidermidis, respectively. The cytotoxic effects of the four extracts were determined by colorimetric MTT assays using two animal cell lines: human dermal fibroblasts and HaCaT cells. Although the M. orientalis root extract had moderate cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells at 200 microg/ml, most extracts exhibited low cytotoxicity at 200 microg/ml in both cell lines. In addition, the extracts reduced the P. acnes-induced secretion of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in THP-1 cells, an indication of their anti-inflammatory effects. Based on these results, we suggest that M. pentaphylla, A. anomala, M. orientalis, and O. japonica are attractive acne-mitigating candidates for topical application.
TI  - Infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - Hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. We therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. Of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. The mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). Among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included Propionibacterium acnes in three, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus species in one, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with Peptostreptococcus in one. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). Two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. The Neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. The data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. The surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  - Isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. We examined the organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. Patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic treatment, and complications were reviewed. The organisms included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (five), Streptococcus B beta hemolytic (five), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), Streptococcus viridans (one), Escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (one), and Propionibacterium acnes (one). We treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). One patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. Another patient died during hospitalization. Open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. Functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: From 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. The medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. Preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and Scoliosis Research Society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. One was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative). The most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). All patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. Culture results were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Group A Streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1). The patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscesens. Revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. Compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (P = 0.01) and lumbar (P = 0.06) curve correction. There was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total Scoliosis Research Society 24 scores. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. Although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils extracted from Korean endemic citrus species.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the chemical composition of 14 kinds of citrus oils and to test their biological activities. Citrus essential oils were obtained by steam distillation from immature fruits collected from Jeju Island and were analyzed using gas chromatograph (GC)- flame ionization detectors (FID) and GC-MS. Limonene (55.4% to 91.7%), myrcene (2.1% to 32.1%), alpha-pinene (0.6% to 1.6%) and linalool (0.4% to 6.9%) were the major components in most citrus species. To evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity, all essential oils were tested against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Nine out of fourteen citrus oils exhibited antibacterial activity against P. acnes, but not against S. epidermidis. The effects of the citrus oils on DPPH radical scavenging, superoxide radical anion scavenging, nitric oxide radical, and cytotoxicity were also assessed. Three essential citrus oils, Joadeung, Dongjunggyul, and Bujiwha, exhibited potent inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production. Two essential oils, Dongjunggyul and Joadeung, showed potent free radical scavenging activities in the DPPH assay. For future applications in cosmetic products, we also performed MTT assays in a human dermal fibroblast cell line. The majority of the essential oils showed no cytotoxicity. The results indicate that citrus essential oils can be useful natural agents for cosmetic application.
TI  - Microbial colonization of an in vitro model of a tissue engineered human skin equivalent--a novel approach.
AB  - This was a preliminary investigation to define the conditions of colonization of  a human skin equivalent (SE) model with cutaneous microorganisms. SEs of 24 mm diameter were constructed with a dermal matrix of fibrin containing fibroblasts and a stratified epidermis. Microbial colonization of the SEs was carried out in a dry environment, comparable to 'in vivo' skin, using a blotting technique to remove inoculation fluid. The microbial communities were sampled by scrub washing and viable cells enumerated on selective growth medium. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and Malassezia furfur (human skin commensals) and Staphylococcus aureus (transient pathogen) were colonized at inoculum densities of 10(2)-10(6) CFU SE(-1) on the surface of replicate SEs. Growth of all species was supported for upto 72-120 h, with recovery densities of between 10(4)-10(9) CFU SE(-1). A novel, real-time growth monitoring method was also developed, using S. aureus containing a lux cassette. Light output increased from 20 to 95 h, and colonization increased from 10(2) to 10(8) CFU SE(-1), as confirmed by conventional recovery. Thus, the SE model has potential to investigate interactions between resident and transient microbial communities with themselves and their habitat, and for testing treatments to control pathogen colonization of human skin.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. METHODS: MIC90s (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase III study and confirmed externally. RESULTS: The most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the phase III study were Haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), Propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). MIC90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. On the other hand, the MIC90 for H. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for S. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for S. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for S. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - [Preoperatively administered flomoxef sodium concentration in aqueous humor].
AB  - PURPOSE: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 0.5-3.5 hours before cataract surgery and measured the concentration of the agent in the aqueous humor to investigate its penetration into the aqueous humor and its efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: 56 patients who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 1 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip beginning 0.5-3.5 hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 0.79 +/- 0.24 microg/ml (administered 3.5 hours before surgery)--1.47 0.79 microg/ml (administered 1.5 hours before surgery). These concentrations administered 0.5-3.0 hours before surgery sufficiently exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes, but did not achieve the MIC90 values against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. This drug may be efficacious in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates: results of a prospective multicenter study comparing pooled whole blood-derived platelets and apheresis platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The GERMS Group initiated a prospective multicenter study to assess prevalence and nature of bacterial contamination of pooled buffy-coat platelet concentrates (PPCs) and apheresis platelet concentrates (APCs) by routine screening with a bacterial culture system. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In nine centers overall, 52,243 platelet (PLT) concentrates (15,198 APCs, 37,045 PPCs) were analyzed by aerobic and anaerobic cultures (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). RESULTS: In 135 PLT concentrates (PCs; 0.26%), bacteria could be identified in the first culture (0.4% for APCs vs. 0.2% for PPCs; p < 0.001). In 37 (0.07%) of these PC units, the same bacteria strain could be identified in a second culture from the sample bag and/or the PC unit. The rate of confirmed-positive units did not differ significantly between APC (0.09%; 1/1169) and PPC units (0.06%; 1/1544). Bacteria from skin flora (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis) were the most prevalent contaminants. Median times to first positive culture from start of incubation were 0.7 and 3.7 days in aerobic and anaerobic cultures for confirmed-positive units. With a "negative-to-date" issue strategy, most PC units (55%) had already been issued by time of the first positive culture. CONCLUSION: The rate of confirmed bacterial contamination of PC units was low. Nevertheless, clinicians must be aware of this risk. The risk of bacterial contamination does not warrant universal preference of APCs. It must be questioned whether routine bacterial screening by a culture method can sufficiently prevent contaminated products from being transfused due to the delay until a positive signal in the culture system and due to false-negative results.
TI  - Biofilm formation by Propionibacterium acnes on biomaterials in vitro and in vivo: impact on diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes is found increasingly as a cause of delayed infection, usually involving implanted biomaterials. Despite susceptibility to common antibiotics, such infections are very difficult to treat and usually require surgical removal of the device. Three clinical isolates of P. acnes were assessed for ability to adhere to titanium, surgical steel and silicone, with and without a plasma conditioning film. After adherence, the biomaterials were then incubated for a further 6 days and examined for biofilm development. All three isolates adhered to all three biomaterials similarly. Importantly, we were able to demonstrate biofilm formation, including production of exopolymer similar in appearance to the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin of Staphylococcus epidermidis. A case summary also demonstrated failure to eradicate P. acnes infection in a hydrocephalus shunt after prolonged treatment. The removed shunt showed obvious biofilm formation, initially obscured by exopolymer when viewed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. Biofilm development by P. acnes explains the difficulties encountered in clinical management of such infections.
TI  - Bacteraemia in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa undergoing carbon dioxide laser surgery: detection and quantification of bacteria by lysis-filtration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a cicatrising and persistent disease of apocrine gland-bearing areas in adults. The severity of this condition varies from a few suppurating lesions to widespread, disabling disease. The aetiology is obscure, but suggested contributory factors include a genetic predisposition, comedones occluding the pilosebaceous apparatus, bacterial infections, and hormonal factors. Treatment consists mainly of surgery, while medical therapies serve principally as adjunct therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the number and type of bacteria circulating in the bloodstream in patients with HS undergoing surgical treatment with a carbon dioxide laser stripping-secondary intention technique. METHODS: Twenty-one patients (20 females and 1 male, mean age 36, range 20-55 years) were included in the study. One blood sample (8.3 ml) was taken before surgery, one during the operation and the last one 10 min after surgery. Five healthy persons (all females, mean age 36, range 23-48 years) not undergoing any operation were used as the controls. The blood was cultured by a lysis-filtration technique which had been shown to be very sensitive. Since the filter catches the microorganisms and colonies are formed during culturing, the number of bacteria in the samples is easily determined. RESULTS: In 6 patients, all samples were negative, which indicates that the method of surgery itself caused no spread of bacteria from the lesions. Bacterial growth in the first blood sample was found in 9 patients, from the second sample in 10 and from the third one in 6. In 1 patient, bacteria were detected in three samples. At least 12 bacterial species were identified. The dominating bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci of which most were subtyped as Staphylococcus warneri. Among the anaerobic microorganisms, Propionibacterium acnes and P.granulosum were the most frequently isolated bacteria. The bacterial findings in the blood samples accord well with the results from a previous study in which cultures were taken from the deep parts of the HS lesions. In the 5 controls, no microbial growth was detected. CONCLUSION: The carbon dioxide laser stripping technique caused no additional spread of bacteria into the bloodstream. The evaluation of cultures containing microorganisms from normal skin flora is controversial. Since the bacteria encountered in this study are in close agreement with the findings in cultures from the deeper parts of HS lesions they seem to be relevant. The growth of bacteria in the first blood sample taken before surgery may indicate that some of these patients have bacteria continuously circulating in their blood.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of nadifloxacin against Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium isolated from patients with dermatological infections].
AB  - Nadifloxacin (NDFX) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is used as a topical drug for the treatment of infections in the field of dermatology. We investigated the susceptibility of a total of 575 strains (two kinds of Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium species which were isolated from patients with dermatological infections for 3 periods, i.e., 1996, 2000 and 2005) to NDFX and other reference antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the four antibiotics, NDFX, levofloxacin (LVFX), clindamycin (CLDM) and gentamicin (GM), against the test strains were determined by the agar dilution methods, in according with the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. The antibacterial activity of NDFX against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and P. acnes was the most potent of all the antibiotics tested, and there were no test organisms which became resistant to NDFX with period. The MIC90 values of NDFX for the four test organisms isolated in 2005 were 0.05 microg/mL; MSSA, 1.56 microg/mL; MRSA, 0.78 microg/mL; S. epidermidis and 0.20 microg/mL; P. acnes, respectively. On the other hand, there were LVFX-, CLDM- and GM-resistant MRSA. The MIC50 values of CLDM and GM for MRSA were >100 and 25 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC50 value of GM for P acnes was 12.5 microg/mL, but NDFX was potently active against these organisms as compared with these two antibiotics and the MIC50 values of NDFX were 0.05 microg/mL for MRSA and 0.20 microg/mL for P. acnes. These results suggest that NDFX is even at present useful as an antibiotic for the treatment of infections in the field of dermatology though it is more than 12 years since the approval to manufacture and sell the drug was obtained in 1993.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis).
AB  - An acidic polysaccharide CS-F2 from Camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Transfer of bacteria between biomaterials surfaces in the operating room--an experimental study.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to and transfer between surfaces is a complicated process. With regard to the success of biomaterials implants, studies on bacterial adhesion and transfer should not be confined to biomaterials surfaces in the human body, but also encompass surfaces in the operating room, where the origin of many biomaterials related infections is found. The purpose of this study was to quantify the transfer of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes from one operating room material to another, while accounting for surface hydrophobicity and roughness, moistness and application of friction during transfer. The tested operating room materials were gloves, broaches (orthopaedic drills), theatre gowns, and light handles. As a possible clinical intervention method to prevent transfer, it was investigated whether dipping the gloves in a chlorhexidine splash-basin affected the viability of the transferred bacteria. Transfer (moist and without friction) was demonstrated to some extent with all bacterial strains and with every material, ranging from 17% to 71%, and was influenced by the bacterial strain, moistness of the inoculum, the application of friction, and the characteristics of both the donating and the receiving surface. Dipping the glove material in 4% or 0.4% chlorhexidine solutions killed all bacteria present, regardless of whether surfaces were dried or moist and thus prevented transfer.
TI  - [The effect of preoperative topical antibiotics in cataract surgery].
AB  - PURPOSE: We studied whether topical antibiotics prevent endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. METHODS: Cefmenoxime hydrochloride (CMX) or artificial tears (AT) were randomly instilled 72 hours before surgery. Conjunctival swab samples were taken before the instillation of eye drops (1) and after the instillation of eye drops (2). Aqueous humor (3) was cultured intraoperatively. RESULTS: Positive cultures were found in the CMX group of eyes in 76.3% of (1) samples, 58.1% of (2) samples, and 6.0% of (3) samples. In the AT group of eyes, positive cultures were found in 78.6% of (1) samples, 63.8% of (2) samples, and 2.9% of (3) samples. CMX was not effective. In the CMX group of eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis was found in 59 eyes of group (1), 5 eyes of group (2), and 0 eyes of group (3). In the AT group of eyes, S. epidermidis was found in 70 eyes of group (1), 26 eyes of group (2), and 1 eye of group (3). In the cases where S. epidermidis was decreased by CMX topical use Propionibacterium acnes was increased. CONCLUSIONS: There is a possibility that preoperative topical use of CMX can reduce S. epidermidis. On the other hand, it might increase P. acnes. Considering these results and the fact that there was no difference in effectiveness in the aqueous humor cultures, preoperative CMX topical use may not prevent postoperative endophthalmitis except for endophthalmitis due to S. epidermidis.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Revision shoulder arthroplasty with positive intraoperative cultures: the value of preoperative studies and intraoperative histology.
AB  - Currently, there are no reported results of patients without overt infection who  had a positive intraoperative culture during revision shoulder arthroplasty. We therefore reviewed the intraoperative and preoperative investigations as well as the postoperative course of these patients who had positive intraoperative cultures. We reviewed the results of 75 shoulders without overt infection that underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at our institution between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 2002 who had positive intraoperative cultures. Preoperatively, the results of 67 (93%) of 72 white-blood-cell counts were negative, 64 (91%) of 70 polymorphonuclear percentage distributions were negative, and 36 (86%) of 42 samples of erythrocyte sedimentation rate were negative. C-reactive protein concentration was measured in 16 patients, of which 12 (75%) had negative results. Results of intraoperative histologic evaluations were negative in 67 (92%) of 73 patients. The most common pathogen cultured was Propionibacterium acnes in 45 of 75, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in 10 of 75. Another operation was necessary in 10 (13%) of 75 shoulders to decrease pain or improve function. The mean time to re-revision was 2.5 years. The data from this study suggest that there are no good preoperative or intraoperative investigations to detect who will have a positive intraoperative culture at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.
TI  - Role of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the use of commercially available triamcinolone acetonide as adjunct treatment for acute-onset endophthalmitis after intraocular procedures. METHODS: Charts of 14 patients who received intravitreal triamcinolone in combination with intravitreal antibiotics for treatment of acute endophthalmitis were reviewed. Patients were included if they presented with pain, vision loss, and severe anterior chamber reaction or hypopyon. Visual acuities, intraocular pressures, anterior chamber reaction, and view of fundus details were recorded at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to 5 months. RESULTS: Culture-positive results were found for 57% (8/14) of patients. Isolated species included Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococcus, group D Streptococcus (nonenterococcus), Propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid bacilli. Visual acuities improved an average of 7.5 Snellen lines. Preendophthalmitis level visual acuities were recovered in 78.6% patients (11/14), with 64% (9/14) of patients achieving visual acuity of 20/40 or better regardless of presenting vision. Resolution of anterior chamber reaction and view of fundus details were consistent with visual acuities. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal triamcinolone combined with intravitreal antibiotics appears to have a safety profile similar to current modalities with a favorable effect on visual recovery and function in the setting of acute postoperative endophthalmitis.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Pulmonary immune responses to Propionibacterium acnes in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes (PA) is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium implicated as a putative etiologic agent of sarcoidosis. To characterize the pulmonary immune response to PA, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized and intratracheally challenged with heat-killed bacteria. C57BL/6 mice challenged with PA developed a cellular immune response characterized by elevations in Th1 cytokines/chemokines, increased numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages in lung lavage fluid, and peribronchovascular granulomatous inflammation composed of T- and B-lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes. T-lymphocytes in the lung lavage fluid showed a marked CD4+ cell predominance. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice challenged with Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), another gram-positive commensal of human skin, and BALB/c mice challenged with PA, showed only a modest induction of Th1 cytokines, less pulmonary inflammation, and no granulomatous changes in the lung. Enhancement of Toll-like receptor expression was seen in PA-exposed C57BL/6 mice within 24 h after exposure, suggesting that induction of innate immunity by PA contributes to the robust, polarized Th1 immune response elicited by this bacterium. These findings suggest that PA-induced pulmonary inflammation may be a useful model for testing the contributions of both bacterial and host factors in the development, maintenance, and resolution of granulomatous inflammation in the lung.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis to killing by MPO-halide system products. Implication for taurine bromamine as a new candidate for topical therapy in treating acne vulgaris.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Taurine chloramine (TauCl) and taurine bromamine (TauBr) are the main haloamines produced by activated neutrophils. TauCl exerts both anti-inflammatory and microbicidal activities. Clinical studies showed that TauCl may be useful as an antimicrobial agent in the local treatment of infections. Much less is known about TauBr. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Propionibacterium acnes (PA) has a role in the inflammation of acne. Available topical therapies include antimicrobial agents which reduce total PA numbers and anti-inflammatory agents which suppress activity of the cells present in acne inflammatory lesions. In this study the bactericidal activities of TauBr and TauCl against PA and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), as a control strain, were investigated. Moreover, the influence of these haloamines on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activated neutrophils was also tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TauBr and TauCl were prepared by reaction of taurine with HOBr and HOCl, respectively. The reaction was monitored by UV absorption spectra. The bactericidal activities of TauBr and TauCl were determined by the pourplate method. The generation of ROS by neutrophils was determined by luminol chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: In our experimental set-up, TauBr showed stronger antibacterial activity than TauCl. Interestingly, PA was significantly more susceptible to TauBr than SE was. Moreover, TauBr at non-cytotoxic concentrations significantly reduced ROS generation by neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: Since PA is considered to be an etiological agent in acne and ROS are closely correlated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, the reported data suggest that TauBr may be a good candidate for the topical therapy for acne vulgaris.
TI  - Long-chain 3-acyl-4-hydroxycoumarins: structure and antibacterial activity.
AB  - By reacting 4-hydroxycoumarin with long-chain acyl chlorides, a number of new 3-acyl derivatives were prepared and the relationship was studied between their structures and activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 11827. Antibacterial activity was associated with enolic tautomers of a tricarbonylmethane group bearing a lipophilic side chain (undec-10-enoyl, undec-10-ynoyl, palmitoyl or octadec-9-enoyl). A newly synthesized 2-acyl derivative of 2H-indene-1,3-dione containing the same tricarbonylmethane motif showed a comparable activity.
TI  - Influence of a new surface modification of intraocular lenses with fluoroalkylsilan on the adherence of endophthalmitis-causing bacteria in vitro.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dynasilan is a fluoroalkylsilan that is able to interact with surface active centres on intraocular lenses (IOL), offering a new way for surface modification of different IOL materials. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of this new surface modification on the adherence of two typical endophthalmitis causing bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a pilot experiment, the effect of Dynasilan coating on the adherence of S. epidermidis was tested on glass slides. Forty-two Dynasilan-modified and 42 unmodified IOL (14 PMMA, 14 silicone and 14 hydrogel) were incubated at 37 degrees C in brain heart infusion broth (10(8) CFU/ml) with either S. epidermidis for 24 h or with P. acnes for 1 h. Subsequently, the adherent bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonification at 35 kHz for 3x45 s. After dilution series and incubation at 37 degrees C on Petri dishes for 24 h and 3 days, respectively, the colonies were counted. RESULTS: In the pilot experiment, a markedly lower number of adherent S. epidermidis was observed on Dynasilan-modified glass slides. Of all IOL materials incubated with S. epidermidis, those modified with Dynasilan showed a lower mean number of adherent bacteria (mean 1.37x10(7); SD 2.37x10(7)) than those untreated (2.43x10(7); SD 3.04x10(7)). IOLs incubated with P. acnes showed a significantly lower mean number of adherent bacteria of 2.51x10(4) (SD 2.71x10(4)) on Dynasilan-modified IOLs versus 6.27x10(4) (SD 7.70x10(4)) on untreated IOLs. CONCLUSION: The presented in vitro results indicate that Dynasilan surface modification is able to reduce the adherence of S. epidermidis and P. acnes on all IOL materials tested. Further studies regarding the stability of this modification and its biocompatibility must be performed.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Very low dose isotretinoin is effective in controlling seborrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive seborrhea, coarse-pored skin, minimal acne and oily scalp hair comprise a well-known clinical entity. It causes considerable concern, has social impact, and affects the quality of life in some individuals. Some patients seek treatment for seborrhea. No effective topical sebosuppressive medication is available. Oral isotretinoin is the only remedy for men. In women, oral isotretinoin is the most effective remedy, followed by antiandrogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients in three groups were treated for 6 months with very low dose isotretinoin. The influence on seborrhea was measured during oral treatment with 5 mg/d, 2.5 mg/d, or 2.5 mg 3x weekly. RESULTS: Sebum production, measured with Sebutape, was reduced by up to 64%. Acne lesions regressed by as much as 84%. Follicular filaments were reduced by 66%. Microcomedones were reduced on average up to 86%. Quantitative bacteriology showed a reduction of Propionibacterium acnes but no increase of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Biopsies revealed a 51% reduction in sebaceous gland size. With Bentonite, a reduction of lipids was demonstrated with 2.5 and 5 mg isotretinoin/d but not with 2.5 mg 3x weekly. There was a shift within the lipid fractions: triglycerides dominated, followed by squalenes and free fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: Good results were achieved in all patients. The small number of patients did not permit a statistical analysis of the three isotretinoin doses studied, but there was a tendency toward better results with the two higher doses.
TI  - Detection of potentially novel bacterial components of the human skin microbiota  using culture-independent molecular profiling.
AB  - Although the micro-organisms forming the cutaneous microbiota are considered to play important roles in the modification and prevention of skin diseases, a comprehensive analysis of their composition has not yet been carried out because of difficulties in determining yet-to-be-cultured micro-organisms in the samples. Swab-scrubbed forehead skin samples of five healthy volunteers were analysed by profiling 16S rRNA genes, as well as by conventional culture methods, to provide a profile of the cutaneous microbiota that included yet-to-be-cultured bacteria from normal human skin. Cluster analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated a marked increase in diversity compared with that derived from the culture methods. Nineteen previously recognized species and 13 novel phylotypes were obtained from the analysis of 416 clones. In addition to well-known bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, phylotype A, the 16S rRNA gene of which is 97 % similar to that of Methylophilus methylotrophus, was detected in three of the five samples, in one of which it was the predominant clone. Culture-independent genetic profiling of 16S rRNA genes for detecting human cutaneous microbiota has allowed us to detect potentially novel components of the cutaneous microbiota in humans.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp.HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC(50) of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was approximately 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin-inflammation and acne.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Flomoxef sodium and levofloxacin concentrations in aqueous humor.
AB  - AIMS: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 120 minutes before cataract surgery, topically administered levofloxacin (LVFX) into the eyes four times at 30-minute intervals before surgery, and measured the aqueous humor concentrations of these agents to investigate their penetration into the aqueous humor and their efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients who underwent cataract surgery at the Department of Ophthalmology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, or its affiliate, Kanazawa Hospital, Yokohama, were enrolled in this study. They received one or both of the following: 1.0 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip and LVFX ophthalmic solution applied four times at 30-minute intervals, both beginning two hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX and LVFX concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 1.21 +/- 0.63 microg/ml and 0.69 +/- 0.47 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations sufficiently exceeded the MIC90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. These drugs may have efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Thai medicinal plants against acne-inducing bacteria.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis have been recognized as pus-forming bacteria triggering an inflammation in acne. The present study was conducted to evaluate antimicrobial activities of Thai medicinal plants against these etiologic agents of acne vulgaris. Crude extracts were tested for antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The results from the disc diffusion method showed that 13 medicinal plants could inhibit the growth of Propionibacterium acnes. Among those, Senna alata, Eupatorium odoratum, Garcinia mangostana, and Barleria lupulina had strong inhibitory effects. Based on a broth dilution method, the Garcinia mangostana extract had the greatest antimicrobial effect. The MIC values were the same (0.039 mg/ml) for both bacterial species and the MBC values were 0.039 and 0.156 mg/ml against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. In bioautography assay, the Garcinia mangostana extract produced strong inhibition zones against Propionibacterium acnes. Antimicrobial activity from fractions of column chromatography revealed one of the active compounds in Garcinia mangostana could be mangostin, a xanthone derivative. Taken together, our data indicated that Garcinia mangostana had a strong inhibitory effect on Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Therefore, this plant would be an interesting topic for further study and possibly for an alternative treatment for acne.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - [Oral clarithromycin as a treatment option in chronic post-operative endophthalmitis].
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the outcome of medical treatment with oral clarithromycin in patients with chronic post-surgical endophthalmitis. METHODS: This prospective study was performed between January 1999 and September 2003. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic post-surgical endophthalmitis of bacterial etiology were included. All received 500 mg of oral clarithromycin twice a day for 14 days. The initial and final visual acuity, etiology, post-surgical time of presentation, treatment-delay time, and follow up were recorded. According to the treatment results, patients were distributed into 3 separate groups: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) no response. Data from these groups were compared by means of the Student's t test and Fisher exact test, depending on which was considered most suitable. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of chronic endophthalmitis (11 of Propionibacterium acnes, 4 of Staphylococcus epidermidis) were diagnosed. A complete response was observed in 4 cases, partial response in 4 cases, and no response in 7 cases. Final visual acuity greater than 0.5 was significantly more likely in the complete response group when compared with the no response group (Fisher exact test = 0.0454, p=0.05), however, the same comparison between the complete response group and the partial response group was not significant. CONCLUSION: Medical treatment with oral clarithromycin could be useful in some patients with chronic post-surgical endophthalmitis.
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts to acne-developing organisms.
AB  - This study aims to present the in vitro inhibitory effect of Psidium guajava and  Juglans regia leaf extracts on the main developer of acne lesions, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and other organisms that are isolated from acne lesions. Thirty-eight subjects (males and females) who had various types of acne were enrolled in the study. The contents of the acne lesions were cultured and the frequency of P. acnes (alone and with Staphylococci spp.) was 47%, whereas the frequencies for Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 13% and 24%, respectively. The antimicrobial activities of Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts, determined by disk diffusion method (zone of inhibition), were compared to tea tree oil (TTO), doxycycline and clindamycin antibiotics. The zones of inhibition due to the Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts ranged from 15.8-17.6 mm against P. acnes, 11.3-15.7 mm against S. aureus and 12.9-15.5 mm against S. epidermidis, respectively. These zones of inhibition were significantly higher than those of TTO and equivalent in case of Staphylococci spp., but less in case of P. acnes, to those obtained from doxycycline or clindamycin. It can be concluded that Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts may be beneficial in treating acne especially when they are known to have anti-inflammatory activities.
TI  - Formulation and evaluation of an effective pH balanced topical antimicrobial product containing tea tree oil.
AB  - The effect of pH on the antimicrobial activity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil formulations was studied. Microemulsions, liposomal dispersions, multiple emulsions and a colloidal bed of sterile clay were formulated using 5% w/w of tea tree oil. A number of formulations were prepared at various pH values (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0). Thermal stability studies showed that the formulations were stable for more than eight months. Agar dilution tests showed MICs of 1.0% v/v S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In the broth dilution test, MBC of the oil for P. acnes was 0.5% v/v. MIC and MBC values were comparable to those of non-formulated tea tree oil, indicating that tea tree oil retained its activity in the above-mentioned formulations. The microbiological evaluation showed that the formulations containing 5% w/w tea tree oil had a maximum effect at pH 5.5.
TI  - Nadifloxacin, an antiacne quinolone antimicrobial, inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal human keratinocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease involving colonization of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), activation of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Circumstantial evidence suggests that antigen-independent and -dependent immune responses against P. acnes are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne. Epidermal keratinocytes are also suggested to be involved in initiation and progression of cutaneous inflammation. Nadifloxacin, a fluorinated quinolone, has potent antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative and -positive microbes and is used to treat multiple inflamed acne lesions. However, its effect on immune conferring cells such as mononuclear cells and keratinocytes has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible involvement of potential anti-inflammatory activity of nadifloxacin in its therapeutic effect on inflammatory acne, we examined the effects of nadifloxacin, in comparison with other antibiotics used to treat acne vulgaris, on cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and keratinocytes. METHODS: Cytokine production by PBMC was determined after treatment with heat-killed P. acnes in the presence or absence of antimicrobials using a real-time PCR and ELISA. Cultured human epidermal keratinocytes were stimulated by IFN-gamma plus IL-1beta and the effects of antimicrobials were examined by using ELISA. RESULTS: Nadifloxacin as well as macrolide antibiotics and clindamycin inhibited IL-12 and IFN-gamma production by PBMC stimulated by heat-killed P. acnes. The drug also inhibited the IL-1alpha, Il-6, IL-8 and GM-CMS production by keratinocytes treated with IFN-gamma plus IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory effects of nadifloxacin to activate T cells and keratinocytes may be involved at least in part in the mechanism of its therapeutic effect against inflammatory acne.
TI  - Different pro-inflammatory and immunogenic potentials of Propionibacterium acnes  and Staphylococcus epidermidis: implications for chronic inflammatory acne.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Propionibacterium acnes (PA) and Staphyloccocus epidermidis (SE) are two major bacterial strains isolated from acne lesions. Nevertheless, only PA seems to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Evidence for this, however, remains indirect and the precise role of PA in inflammatory acne is still a matter for conjecture. The aim of this study was to compare some pro-inflammatory and adjuvant properties of PA and SE. MATERIAL/METHODS: To determine some of the pathogenic, immunostimulatory, and pro-inflammatory proper of PA and SE, two experimental models of inflammation were used. In vivo; chronic inflammation was induced by intradermal injection of living bacteria into the ear. In vitro; peritoneal macrophages elicited by the bacteria were examined for their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and cytokines. RESULTS: PA, but not SE, evoked mild local inflammation of infected ears. Macrophages elicited with PA produced more tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin IL-12 than those induced with SE, while SE was a stronger inducer of IL-10 production. Both bacteria equally induced the generation of NO and ROS. In contrast, only PA showed adjuvant proper-ties. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies indicate that SE, in contrast to PA, does not exert pro-inflammatory properties. Thus it is unlikely that SE may be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne vulgaris.
TI  - Retrospective case review of capsular contracture after two-stage breast reconstruction: is colonization of the tissue expander pocket associated with subsequent implant capsular contracture?
AB  - Periprosthetic capsular contracture is a common problem associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine if bacterial colonization of the tissue expander contributes to contracture of the permanent implant. Medical records were reviewed for 86 patients (124 tissue expanders) between 1997 and 2001 in 1 institution. Three specimens taken from the expander were cultured. The overall incidence of colonization was 42.7%; 49.4% (38.8-60.0) of immediate and 28.2% (14.1-42.3) of delayed expanders had at least 1 positive culture site (P = 0.043). The most common organisms were Propionibacterium acnes (57.6%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.0%), and Peptostreptococcus (5.8%). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between colonization of the expander and capsular contracture of the permanent prosthesis (P = 0.59). 45.8% (25.9-65.8) of breasts irradiated preoperatively developed contracture versus 14% (7.2-20.8) with no irradiation (P = 0.0013). These results suggest that colonization of the expander occurs frequently, irradiation predisposes to contracture, and colonization did not contribute to secondary implant contracture in this study population.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of diesters of azelaic acid.
AB  - A number of diesters of the topical dermatosis treatment azelaic (nonanedioic) acid were prepared and tested for antibacterial effect. Two esters, bis-[(hexanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate and especially bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate showed promising activity against acne related bacteria in vitro. No activity of azelaic acid was detected in Mueller Hinton II agar at pH 7.3 when using the agar diffusion method, whereas both esters gave zones of growth inhibition. At pH 5.6, activity of azelaic acid was detected. At this pH, the zones of inhibition and MIC values obtained with azelaic acid were smaller than those of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate for all test organisms. A preparation for topical use containing 20% (w/w) bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate, and the commercially available Skinoren (20% (w/w) azelaic acid), were compared for antibacterial effect against cutaneous bacteria using contact plate analyses of the skin. Though Skinoren was usually most effective, the differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, bacteria surviving contact with the topical preparations were invariably more sensitive to the ester than to azelaic acid upon subculturing onto agar (pH 5.6) containing either preparation at 0.2-0.7 mg/ml. This might indicate that other factors, such as the composition of the cream base, mitigate the antibacterial activity of the ester. It is proposed that the pharmacological and microbiological properties of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate are worthy of further study based on an extended screening of acne sufferers.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001. Endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). The outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. RESULTS: In all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), Streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and Propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). Overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. For gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. For gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. Fungal isolates were Candida species (9/313), Aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). Among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: S epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: Aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. Knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories will help direct appropriate initial therapy.
TI  - [The influence of a new surface treatment of silicone intracoular lenses with fluoralkylsitan on the adherence of endophthalmitic bacteria in vitro]].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dynasilan is a fluoroalkylsilan which is able to bind to surface active molecules of intraocular lenses (IOLs), thereby offering a new option for surface modification of silicone lenses. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the influence of this new surface treatment on the adherence of two typical endophthalmitis-inducing bacteria ( Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 Dynasilan-treated and 14 untreated silicone lenses were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h in brain heart infusion broth (10(8) CFU/ml) either with Staphylococcus epidermidis or with Propionibacterium acnes for 1 h. Subsequently, the adherent bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonification at 35 kHz for 3 x 45 s. After a dilution series and incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h or 3 days the colonies were counted. RESULTS: On untreated IOLs incubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis the average number of bacteria was 3.6 x 10(7)/ml, and on treated IOLs the number of counted colonies was reduced to 1.09 x 10(7)/ml. Incubated with Propionibacterium acnes the average number of adherent bacteria on untreated IOLs was 4.75 x 10(4)/ml and on modified IOLs the number was reduced to 2.94 x 10(4)/ml. CONCLUSION: Dynasilan surface treatment may reduce the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes on silicone intraocular lenses. Further studies regarding the stability of this treatment, its biocompatibility and influence on lens epithelial cell adhesion are in progress.
TI  - Severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in New Zealand.
AB  - AIM: To identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in New Zealand. METHODS: Over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to Auckland Hospital were identified. The clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (SD 15.5) days. The majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). Corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. Bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being Gram positive organisms (72%). The most common isolates identified were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16%), Propionibacterium acnes (14%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). In addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in 4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. Importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. Antimicrobial treatment was changed on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). Median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logMAR 0.86) (IQR 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logMAR 0.360) (IQR 0.15-1.70), respectively. Previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer visual acuity. The mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (IQR 2.0-8.0) days. Longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. A significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. Previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. Many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.
TI  - Full-thickness thoracic laminar erosion after posterior spinal fusion associated  with late-presenting infection.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report describes unilateral complete laminar erosion of the  caudal thoracic spine and late-presenting infection in a patient 10 years after anteroposterior reconstruction for scoliosis. OBJECTIVE: To present an unusual but significant complication that may occur after implantation of spinal instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The reported patient presented with a deep infection and persistent back pain 10 years after successful anteroposterior reconstruction for adult idiopathic scoliosis. Delayed onset infections after implantation of spinal instrumentation are infrequent, yet when present, often require hardware removal. METHODS: The case of a 51-year-old woman who underwent irrigation and debridement for a late-presenting infection and removal of posterior hardware 10 years after her index procedure is presented. Interoperatively, it was noted that full-thickness laminar erosion was present from T4 to T12. RESULTS: The patient was taken to the operating room for wound irrigation, debridement, and hardware removal. It was discovered that a Cotrel-Dubousset rod placed on the convexity of the curve had completely eroded through the lamina of T7-T12. Infectious material was found along the entire length of both the convex and concave Cotrel-Dubousset rods. Intraoperative cultures grew Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes. Intravenous and oral antibiotics were administered, resulting in resolution of the infection and preoperative pain. CONCLUSIONS: The exact role of late-presenting infection with regard to the laminar erosion and rod migration seen in this case remains to be elucidated. However, the authors believe the primary cause of bony erosion was mechanical in origin. Regardless, most spine surgeons will treat many patients who have had posterior spinal implants and will perform hardware removal on a significant number of these patients during their careers. A full-thickness laminar erosion exposes the spinal cord to traumatic injury during hardware removal and debridement. This case is presented as a cautionary note to help surgeons become cognizant of a potentially devastating complication.
TI  - Formation of Propionibacterium acnes biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials and their susceptibility to antimicrobials.
AB  - Failure to treat and eradicate prosthetic hip infection with systemic antibiotic  regimens is usually due to the fact that the infection is associated with biofilm formation and that bacterial cells growing within a biofilm exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. In this in vitro study, we investigated the susceptibility of prosthetic hip Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus spp. isolates growing within biofilms on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to a range of antibiotics. All P. acnes isolates in the biofilm mode of growth demonstrated considerably greater resistance to cefamandole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. In contrast, only four of the eight P. acnes isolates demonstrated an increase in resistance to gentamicin. All ten Staphylococcus spp. isolates in the biofilm mode of growth exhibited large increases in resistance to gentamicin and cefamandole with eight of the ten isolates also exhibiting an increase in resistance to vancomycin. However, only three of the ten Staphylococcus spp. isolates exhibited an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin. Biofilms were also formed on three different titanium alloys and on PMMA bone cement using P. acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus strains to determine if the underlying biomaterial surface had an effect on biofilm formation and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria growing within biofilms. Although differences in the rate at which the three strains adhered to the different biomaterials were apparent, no differences in biofilm antibiotic resistance between the biomaterials were observed. In the light of these results, it is important that the efficacy of other antibiotics against P. acnes and Staphylococcus spp. prosthetic hip isolates growing within biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials be determined to ensure optimal treatment of orthopaedic implant infection.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Acne phototherapy with a high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source: an open study and in vitro investigation.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of phototherapy with a  newly-developed high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source in patients with mild to moderate acne. An open study was performed in acne patients who were treated twice a week up to 5 weeks. Acne lesions were reduced by 64%. Two patients experienced dryness. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. In vitro investigation revealed that irradiation from this light source reduced the number of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), but not Staphylococcus epidermidis that were isolated from the acne patients. Phototherapy using this blue light source was effective and well tolerated in acne patients and had an ability to decrease numbers of P. acnes in vitro, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new modality for the treatment of acne.
TI  - [Therapeutic strategy in delayed postoperative endophtalmitis: a report on 15 cases].
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the treatment strategies and visual acuity outcomes of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis. MATERIAL: and methods: The authors reviewed the records of 15 patients presenting 3 or more weeks after cataract surgery with intraocular inflammation and treated at Bicetre Hospital from 1992 to 1998. Group I included 6 consecutive patients treated with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotic injection (vancomycin and cefazolin). Group II included 9 consecutive patients treated with intravitreal antibiotic injection (vancomycin and ceftazidime) and irrigation of the capsular bag (vancomycin). The minimum follow-up period was 1 year. RESULTS: In group I, 2 patients had recurrent inflammation. In these patients, the capsular bag and the intraocular implant were removed. In 1 patient there was culture-proven Corynebacterium and in 1 patient a Staphylococcus epidermidis was found. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 5 patients and 20/100 in 1 patient. Visual acuity improved in all cases. In group II no recurrence was seen in the 12-20 months of follow-up. In 2 patients there was proven Staphylococcus epidermidis and in one patient Propionibacterium acnes was found. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or more in 3 patients, 20/100 or more in 4 patients and less than 20/200 in 2 patients. Visual acuity improved in 8 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal antibiotic injection with vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotic injection with antibiotic irrigation of the capsular bag are both effective in the treatment of delayed chronic postoperative endophthalmitis; however, with the second approach, there is minimal surgical trauma and the intraocular implant is retained.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  - The diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of the anterior chamber during phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of bacterial contamination of the anterior chamber after phacoemulsification cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Ninety-eight consecutive eyes of 96 patients having phacoemulsification cataract surgery with IOL implantation were included in this prospective study. Two intraoperative anterior chamber aspirates were obtained from each patient, 1 taken at the start and the other at the conclusion of surgery. In addition, preoperative and postoperative conjunctival swabs were acquired. The 4 specimens were cultured using direct culturing techniques under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 14 days. No preoperative antibiotics were used. RESULTS: The incidence of intraoperative anterior chamber contamination was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0%-3.7%) as all intraoperative anterior chamber samples proved culture negative. Sixty-five percent of the preoperative conjunctival swabs were positive for growth, with corynebacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Propionibacterium acnes being the most frequently cultured organisms. Sixteen percent of the postoperative conjunctival swabs were positive for growth, with corynebacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci being the most common bacteria. One patient developed culture-positive postoperative endophthalmitis; using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for further typing, the implicated Staphylococcus epidermidis was indistinguishable from that isolated from the patient's preoperative conjunctival swab. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial contamination rate of the anterior chamber after phacoemulsification and IOL implantation was extremely low. Additional findings support the conjunctiva as being a primary source of bacteria causing postoperative endophthalmitis as well as the ability of povidone-iodine to reduce the conjunctival bacterial load.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. The in vitro activity of T-3912 against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the MIC90 for the clinical isolates. The activity of T-3912 was not influenced by grlA mutation in S. aureus, and the degree of MIC increase of T-3912 for grlA-gyrA double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). The inhibitory activity of T-3912 was compared with other quinolones for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV of S. aureus SA113. T-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes among the quinolones tested. The isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for S. aureus SA113 and P. acnes JCM 6425, respectively. Furthermore, resistance to T-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. T-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. T-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by S. aureus SA113, P. acnes JCM6425 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus F-2161. These results indicate that T-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.
TI  - Erythromycin-resistance of cutaneous bacterial flora in acne.
AB  - Some studies have raised the problem of an increase of bacterial resistance in acne patients. This study was carried out in France, where no previous studies about resistance to erythromycin has been performed, on 40 patients with mild to moderately severe acne. Microbiological samples were obtained by using Williamson and Kligman method. This study showed that the prevalence of bacterial resistance to erythromycin was 95% for Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and 52% for Propionibacterium acnes strains. Resistant strains were more frequent in patients with predominantly inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules). The influence of previous or current treatment with erythromycin was also studied and showed that even patients without any previous use of erythromycin had resistant strains for Propionibacterium acnes (42%). In addition the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for zinc were evaluated. All the Propionibacterium acnes strains tested were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to 512 mug/ml of zinc. However, zinc combined with erythromycin in vitro did not modify the erythromycin MIC. This first French study on bacterial resistance to erythromycin in acne patients confirms the results of studies performed in other countries.
TI  - Shunt nephritis from Propionibacterium acnes in a solitary kidney.
AB  - Since its initial description in 1965, immune complex glomerulonephritis associated with ventriculoatrial shunts (VAS) has been reported widely in the literature. The most common incriminating organism is Staphylococcus epidermidis, but less often, an organism generally regarded as nonpathogenic, such as Propionibacterium acnes, has been noted as the cause. Shunt infection usually occurs within a few months after placement or manipulation of the shunt, and shunt nephritis (SN) develops gradually over months to years after. Treatment involves mandatory removal of the shunt and antibiotics; prognosis is variable. We report a case of SN with P acnes that is unusual because of its occurrence in a solitary kidney 6 years after shunt placement, persistently negative blood cultures, and normal complement levels. Percutaneous biopsy of a solitary kidney should be considered if it is expected that the result may guide therapy of progressive renal failure.
TI  - Delayed infections after posterior TSRH spinal instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis: revisited.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of delayed infections in idiopathic scoliosis treated with TSRH instrumentation, proper wound management after instrumentation removal, and whether the previously identified bacterial trend remains consistent. METHODS: All patients with idiopathic scoliosis > or =2 years after surgery with posterior TSRH instrumentation were included. Those cases with delayed infections were retrospectively reviewed. Time of presentation (infection) from index operation, clinical picture, sedimentation rate, presence of pseudarthrosis, organisms grown on culture, type of wound closure, and duration of antibiotics were examined. RESULTS: A total of 489 patients were identified > or =2 years postoperation; 23 had delayed infections (4.7%). Time of presentation averaged 27 months after initial surgery. Spontaneous drainage occurred in 15 patients, fluctuance in 6, and neither in the remaining 2 (pain and fever). Sedimentation rate averaged 48 mm/hr. All patients had instrumentation removed. Primary closure (1 stage) was performed in 14 patients, and delayed primary closure (> or =2 stages) was performed in nine patients. All wounds healed uneventfully. Cultures at the time of instrumentation removal grew Propionibacterium acnes in 12 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis (or Staphylococcus coagulase-negative) in 4, Micrococcus varians in 1, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1. Five patients had negative cultures. After removal, patients received parenteral antibiotics; in 21 of these patients this was followed by oral antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Low-virulent skin organisms are primarily responsible for delayed infections. Intraoperative seeding followed by subclinical quiescent periods appears to be the method by which infection occurs. The increased bulk and modularity of modern instrumentation systems can lead to inflammation and bursa formation, thus contributing significantly to the activation of these infections. Primary wound closure results in successful wound healing. Delayed closure after 48 hours is unnecessary. Short-term postoperative parenteral antibiotics (2-5 days) followed by short-term oral antibiotics (7-14 days) is recommended.
TI  - Acute bilateral postoperative endophthalmitis in a HLA-DQ5-positive patient: possible susceptibility to infections.
AB  - An unusual case of bilateral acute endophthalmitis in association with the HLA-DQ5 histocompatibility antigen is reported. A 35-year-old woman with high myopia and cataracts in both eyes underwent phacoemulsification procedures performed in separate sessions using different viscoelastic substances and following the same strict prophylactic measures. After each surgical procedure, she developed S. epidermidis acute endophthalmitis in the right eye and Propionibacterium acnes acute endophthalmitis in the left eye; both were successfully treated with capsular bag irrigation and intracameral vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL). She tested positive for the HLA-DQ5 (DQ1), DQ2 antigen. The question is raised as to whether the HLA-DQ5 histocompatibility antigen may be a predisposing factor for both staphylococcal and P. Acnes acute endophthalmitis. A multicenter prospective study is proposed to identify this HLA antigen in all patients scheduled for cataract surgery who have a history of postoperative endophthalmitis in the fellow eye.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Activation of clindamycin phosphate by human skin.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the relative antimicrobial activity of clindamycin phosphate (CP) and clindamycin (Cly) and to examine the effect of skin homogenates on the activity of CP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against dermally relevant organisms and bactericidal activity was studied using time-kill methodology. The effect of skin homogenates on the antimicrobial activity of CP was studied by well-diffusion assay. The MIC of Cly was substantially lower than that of CP in all susceptible organisms. Clindamycin also showed greater bactericidal activity (rate of kill) than CP. Phosphatases in skin homogenates activated CP at pH 4-8 with a maximal activation at pH 4. CONCLUSION: Phosphatases within the skin have been shown to convert CP to the more potent form Cly. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Conversion to Cly is a major determinant of antimicrobial activity in the skin layers following topical application of CP.
TI  - Killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes photosensitizers and light. Whereas PDT use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial PDT (APDT) is still in its early stages of development. OBJECTIVES: To study microbial killing in vitro using APDT. METHODS: We used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. Using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mW cm(-2)) and methylene blue dye at 100 microg mL(-1), kill rates and subsequent D-values were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: D-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. The effects of light intensity on the killing of S. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. A high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that APDT of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - A high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the external eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution of bacteria on the external surface of eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to investigate the relationship between the frequency of bacterial colonization and the grade of atopy or ocular diseases associated with AD. DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six AD patients (mean age, 24.5 years) and 16 nonatopic, age-matched control participants (mean age, 25.5 years). INTERVENTION: The eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs were scraped with sterile swabs. These samples were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture media. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency distribution of bacteria isolated from the eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs. RESULTS: Bacteria isolated from AD patients were: Staphylococcus aureus in 21 of 36 patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in two patients); Staphylococcus epidermidis in two patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in one patient); other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in six patients;alpha-streptococcus in three patients; Corynebacterium species in three patients; Neisseria species in two patients; and Propionibacterium acnes in one patient. From the nonatopic control participants, we isolated S. aureus in one patient, S. epidermidis in two patients and alpha-streptococcus in one patient. S. aureus was isolated from 67% of the AD patients, and any type of bacteria was isolated from 86% of the patients. These rates were significantly higher than those of nonatopic control participants (6% S. aureus and 25% any bacteria). There was no significant relationship between the frequency distribution of bacteria and the grade of atopy or associated ocular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of bacterial colonization, especially S. aureus, were found in the conjunctival sacs and eyelid margins of AD patients. In case management of AD patients, this unique distribution of bacteria must be carefully considered.
TI  - The shampoo clue: two cases of infection of a ventriculoatrial shunt.
AB  - Despite the use of sophisticated tools, infections of implanted devices may be difficult to diagnose. Two cases of infections of ventriculoatrial shunts, which demonstrate the eminent importance of meticulously taking history, are reported and discussed.
TI  - The effects of amoxicillin therapy on skin flora in infants.
AB  - In order to determine the effect of amoxicillin therapy on the perineal skin microbial flora in infants, we took quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures of perineal and sternal areas from 25 infants treated with amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Specimens were obtained prior to therapy, within 3 days of conclusion of therapy, and 14-16 days later. Immediately following therapy, a decline in the number of bacterial isolates occurred on both the perineum (89 to 47) and sternum (84 to 39). The greatest decline occurred in the number of anaerobic bacteria (mostly Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes). Other organisms that were less often isolated were aerobic streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The number of Candida albicans isolates increased from 3 to 11 (p < 0.05) on the perineum, and 1 to 7 (p < 0.025) on the sternum. Four of the infants developed diaper dermatitis. The density of C. albicans increased more than 14-fold following amoxicillin therapy. Cultures done 14-16 days after cessation of therapy revealed an increase in the number of bacterial isolates on the perineum (47 to 72) and on the sternum (39 to 61) and a decline in recovery of C. albicans. This study demonstrates the effects of amoxicillin on the ecology of skin microbial flora in infants-a decrease in the number of bacterial isolates and an increase in recovery of C. albicans.
TI  - [Microbiological flora cultured from peritoneal fluid of women in reproductive age].
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the presence of the microbes in peritoneal fluid of women in reproductive age. An investigation was performed on the group of 144 women operated laparoscopically in Division of Reproduction. The bacteria were cultured from 77 fluids (53.5%). The most common bacteria were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (34.1%) and Propionibacterium acnes (19.3%). In our group of patients 88 strains of bacteria were isolated. Sensitivity to antibiotics differed in many points. This situation does not allow to prepare any universal scheme of antibiotic therapy. We stress the necessity of assessing the type of bacteria and antibiotic resistance before the treatment get started. It seems to be especially important in pelvic pain syndrome and in pelvic inflammatory disease when operative procedure is necessary for bacteria isolation.
TI  - Vitrectomy for endophthalmitis after intraocular lens implantation.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the results of vitrectomy and intraocular lens (IOL) removal for the treatment of endophthalmitis after IOL implantation. METHODS: We reviewed 14 eyes of 14 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy because of postoperative endophthalmitis. Culture results, surgical methods, and visual outcome are presented. RESULTS: The cultures grew Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), and gram-negative bacillus (n = 3). The eyes infected with E. faecalis had poor visual outcome. Eleven eyes treated by the combination of pars plana vitrectomy and IOL removal did not have a recurrence. The remaining 3 eyes on which only vitrectomy was performed had a recurrence, and the additional procedures consisting of vitrectomy and IOL removal could result in eradicating endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: A higher rate of E. faecalis was detected and these eyes had severe inflammation and poor visual outcome. Combined vitrectomy and IOL removal may be a more certain method to prevent recurrence.
TI  - The bacteriology of acne vulgaris and antimicrobial susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from acne lesions.
AB  - We examined the species of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from 30 acne lesions and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) using nine antimicrobial agents. Among the bacteria isolated, S. epidermidis was most dominant. Both P. acnes and S. epidermidis were isolated from half of the acne lesions. The MIC of seven antimicrobials (ampicillin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, minocycline, nadifloxacin) against P. acnes was under 3.13 micrograms/ml. There were very few resistant strains of P. acnes, but many of S. epidermidis. More than 30% of the S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. After long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, the resistant strains of S. epidermidis increased, but P. acnes resistance was still limited. When we use antimicrobial agents for the treatment of acne, it should be noticed that not only P. acnes but also S. epidermidis in the acne lesions may acquire resistance to antimicrobials.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - [Prognosis of postoperative endophthalmitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome of 20 patients is summarized in a retrospective study to  identify clinical findings that influence the long-term prognosis of postoperative endophthalmitis. PATIENTS: Between 1991 and 1997 a total of 20 patients with postoperative endophthalmitis were admitted. Median age was 80 years (range: 9-95), 11 patients were male, 9 female. Sixteen pars-plana vitrectomies, 2 anterior vitrectomies and 2 rinsings of the anterior chamber without vitrectomy were performed. Furthermore, all patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotic treatment. For microbiological investigation, specimens from vitreous, anterior chamber and conjunctiva were sent in. Long-term outcome was controlled for an average of 14 months after treatment of the endophthalmitis (range: 4-36 months). RESULTS: At the end of treatment, 40% of patients had a visual acuity of 0.4 or better, 80% had 1/20 or better. Patients with a preoperative visual acuity of at least hand movement had a better postoperative visual outcome than patients with only light perception. Visual acuity was better in patients with chronic endophthalmitis than in patients with acute or subacute endophthalmitis. In patients with chronic or subacute endophthalmitis, improvement of visual acuity was found some months after the operation more often than in patients with acute endophthalmitis. However, in 40% of cases with an acute onset, no improvement or even worsening of the visual acuity was documented. Best postoperative results were found after infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSION: Important prognostic factors of postoperative endophthalmitis are visual acuity, the onset of the endophthalmitis (acute, subacute or chronic) and the microbiological findings. At the time of surgery and antibiotic treatment, visual acuity should be at least hand motion to expect an improvement in the visual outcome.
TI  - Antibacterial and antiandrogen flavonoids from Sophora flavescens.
AB  - Sixteen flavanones, three flavanonols, and four pterocarpans were isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Sophora flavescens. Twelve of these were new compounds, including eight prenylflavanones (1-8), one prenylflavanonol (9) and three novel pterocarpane derivatives (10-12). Their structures were elucidated using NMR and mass spectral methods. Some of these compounds have irregular C10 prenyl moieties at C-8 of the flavanone skeleton. These compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, S. epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes. They also exhibited antiandrogen activities.
TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas. In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.

TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis. Microbiological analysis as a principle for therapeutic recommendations].
AB  - PURPOSE: The study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear. Based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the University Eye Hospital in Munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. Ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. The germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. Observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. RESULTS: The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), S. aureus (18%), Streptococcus spp. (10%), Propionibacterium acnes (7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). Gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. CONCLUSION: Keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. Those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. In keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.
TI  - [Acne vulgaris: local and systemic treatment].
AB  - Acne vulgaris is a skin disease affecting mainly young people. To its pathogenetical factors belong: excessive serum production, cornification of hair follicles and presence of different bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pityrosporum ovale) on the skin and within hair follicles leading to skin inflammation. Therapeutical approach to the patient depends on the clinical presentation of the disease. And so, in its local treatment are benzyl peroxide, azelaic acid, topical antibiotics, hormonal therapy and retinoids whereas in systemic one are found oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy and retinoids.
TI  - In vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of the external eye. Pure reference strain cultures of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. Serial twofold dilutions of 2% HPMC, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. One hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. After 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. After 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. C. albicans and P. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. P. acnes and P. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. S. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. S. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. The viability of P. aeruginosa in HPMC dilutions needs to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of HPMC may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. Based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. The causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. The resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated germs were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. Frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by Staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to Streptococcus spp. In this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. Gram-negative germs like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). CONCLUSION: In contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. In such cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. To cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. The latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of Streptococcus spp. co-involvement.
TI  - [The resistance of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis to cyclines. The Research and Study Group on Acne].
AB  - BACKGROUND: A rising percentage of tetracycline-resistant Propionibacterium acnes strains has been reported in the English literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a population of 16 patients with acne who had been treated with oral tetracyclines during the preceding year. A bacteriological examination of a skin biopsy was obtained in all patients to determine aerobic and anaerobic flora as wells as resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were frequently resistant to tetracycline (87.5%) as well as minocycline (30%). Tetracycline-resistant Propionibacterium acnes were also observed (7%). Inversely, we were unable to evidence any minocycline-resistant Propionibacterium acnes strains. CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize the importance of determining whether therapeutic response is related or not to the presence of resistant strains.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of external ocular microbial growth and aqueous humor contamination during cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the route of aqueous humor contamination leading to the development of postoperative endophthalmitis. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki, Finland. METHODS: Forty-nine eyes of 49 patients (31 having phacoemulsification and 18 extracapsular cataract extraction [ECCE]) participated in the study. Four bacterial cultures were taken: preoperative conjunctival swab, lid margin culture, intraoperative lacrimal lake sample, and immediate postoperative anterior chamber fluid sample. RESULTS: Preoperative lid margin cultures were positive in 59.2% of eyes, conjunctival cultures in 69.4%, and lacrimal lake cultures in 24.9%. Four aqueous humor samples (8.2%) showed bacterial growth in the anterior chamber aspirate: 3 in the phacoemulsification and 1 in the ECCE group. The bacteria isolated in this study, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes (2 positive isolates each) were sensitive to the preoperative topical antibiotics used. No aqueous humor sample or any from other locations showed gram-negative microbe growth. The most frequently recovered microbes in all samples collected from the 3 other sources were S epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, followed by P acnes and other propionibacterium species. Staphylococcus aureus, and diptheroids. CONCLUSION: The ocular surface significantly contributed to the transmission of microbes into the eye during cataract surgery. These microbes could not be eradicated by topical preoperative antibiotics. However, no patient developed postoperative endophthalmitis. Natural defense mechanisms appear to fend off a minor inoculum with these microbes of relatively low pathogenicity.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Improved detection of infection in hip replacements. A currently underestimated problem.
AB  - Our aim was to determine if the detection rate of infection of total hip replacements could be improved by examining the removed prostheses. Immediate transfer of prostheses to an anaerobic atmosphere, followed by mild ultrasonication to dislodge adherent bacteria, resulted in the culture of quantifiable numbers of bacteria, from 26 of the 120 implants examined. The same bacterial species were cultured by routine microbiological techniques from only five corresponding tissue samples. Tissue removed from 18 of the culture-positive implants was suitable for quantitative tissue pathology and inflammatory cells were present in all samples. Furthermore, inflammatory cells were present in 87% of tissue samples taken from patients whose implants were culture-negative. This suggests that these implants may have been infected by bacteria which were not isolated by the techniques of culture used. The increased detection of bacteria from prostheses by culture has improved postoperative antibiotic therapy and should reduce the need for further revision.
TI  - Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. METHODOLOGY: The study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged 21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. In all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. Microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. Duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12) and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). RESULTS: Complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40 (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. Mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. A variety of organisms were cultured from pancreatic fluid, E. coli being the most prevalent. Enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. Cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. The level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.
TI  - Percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage for pyogenic spondylitis.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of results in 23 cases of early-stage pyogenic spondylitis treated with percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage as a treatment method for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional surgical treatment for pyogenic spondylitis has the disadvantage of increased morbidity caused by the extensive exposure required in the presence of infection. Recently, a few case reports have described minimally invasive treatment for pyogenic spondylitis in which percutaneous suction aspiration was used. However, the efficacy of this new treatment has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: All charts, radiographs, and bacteriologic and histologic findings were reviewed. All 23 patients who received the new treatment were observed clinically and radiographically, to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: To date, all patients have been observed for more than 2 years. Twenty (87%) of the 23 patients have shown good results according to the evaluation. The causative organism was identified using tissue culturing in 12 (52%) of the 23 patients. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in 8, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium acnes in 1 each. Back pain as the major symptom in these patients was relieved within an average of 9.4 days after the operation. However, the patient in whom the spondylitis was caused by Candida albicans has received this new treatment twice without success. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of percutaneous suction aspiration with drainage shows that it is an effective treatment for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis.

TI  - Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to 10 Kampo formulations.
AB  - We examined the in vitro sensitivities of three bacteria: Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, commonly detected in acne lesions, and Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of skin infections, to 10 Kampo formulations (Chinese herbal medicines; combinations of powdered extracts of crude drugs). Both Staphylococcus species showed similar sensitivities to all 10 formulations, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 25 to 400 mg/ml. P. acnes, however, was particularly sensitive to one formulation, keigai-rengyo-to (MIC, 0.78-25 mg/ml), prompting speculation that it might contain components with strong antibacterial activity to P. acnes. P. acnes showed similar sensitivities to all the other formulations (MIC 6.25-200 mg/ml). The ranges of MICs and the MIC50S (concentrations that inhibit 50% of isolates) were very similar to those previously recorded in 1990 for the two Staphylococcus species.
TI  - Delayed infection after elective spinal instrumentation and fusion. A retrospective analysis of eight cases.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of eight cases of delayed spinal infection after elective posterior or combined anterior and posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion. OBJECTIVES: These cases are reviewed to identify risk factors for delayed spinal infection after elective instrumentation and to describe the treatment of this complication. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed spinal infection after elective spinal instrumentation and fusion is uncommon. This diagnosis is frequently difficult. METHODS: Five cases seen in the senior author's practice and three referral cases are reviewed. RESULTS: Of these eight cases, the organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in six cases, Propionibacterium acnes in one cases, and in the final patient, all intraoperative cultures were negative. Clinical presentations were variable; however, all patients reported back pain. Seven patients had elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, averaging 57 mm/hour. Only two had elevated white blood cell counts. No distant foci of infection were identified in any patient. Five-patients were found to have at least one pseudarthrosis. All patients were treated with debridement, instrumentation removal, and primary wound closure over drains followed by a minimum 6-week course of culture-directed postoperative antibiotics. At an average follow-up of 18 months, no patient has evidence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of delayed infection after elective spinal instrumentation and fusion requires a high index of suspicion. These infections may have been caused by intraoperative inoculation. All patients were successfully treated with debridement, instrumentation removal, and culture-directed postoperative antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial flora of stethoscopes' earpieces and otitis externa.
AB  - External otitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was observed in a nurse after extensive use of a stethoscope. The infection recurred and a similar organism was isolated from the stethoscope's earpiece. The infection did not recur after the earpiece was cleansed after each use. In a prospective study, the bacterial flora of 35 earpieces was evaluated. Fifty-three isolates, 36 aerobic or facultative and 17 anaerobic, were recovered. The number of organisms per earpiece ranged from 14 to 204 (average 92 +/- 17). The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 isolates), Propionibacterium acnes (12), and Saureus (7). The study demonstrates the colonization of the stethoscope's earpiece with microorganisms that possess the potential for causing nosocomial infection.
TI  - Possible implication of sterile connecting device in contamination of pooled platelet concentrates.
AB  - Considering the possibility that a pooled random donor platelet concentrate could become contaminated by welding with a sterile connecting device, we undertook a study to determine the influence of pooling on the contamination rate. As a control group, apheresis platelets were examined. Bacteriological testing was done with a sensitive CO2 detecting culture system, the BacT/ Alert. Out of 1105 pooled platelet concentrates prepared by the buffy coat method, 15 (1.4%) were confirmed as contaminated, all with Staphylococcus epidermidis and two with a second bacterial species, i.e. Staphylococcus capitis and Propionibacterium acnes, respectively. Median detection time by the BacT/Alert was 23 h. Twelve pools of five units were contaminated, which is significantly more than the three contaminated pools of four units. On the other hand, the reuse of the welding wafers proved not be a risk factor for contamination. One welded tubing segment of a contaminated platelet concentrate failed the air leakage test, an incident which was 73 times more frequent than with the sterile platelet concentrates. We found five pooled platelet concentrates containing Staphylococci from which no bacteria could be grown from the individual buffy coats that had been pooled. We suggest the contamination here to have occurred after separation of the buffy coat from the whole blood, possibly during the welding process. Finally, none out of 378 apheresis platelet concentrates was contaminated. All our observations highlight the potential risk for contamination when making pooled platelet concentrates with a sterile connecting device. For this type of transfusion product, we advocate bacteriological screening of all units before release. The incubation time for the sterility test should, however, be limited to 36 h, if logistical problems with the availability of platelets are to be avoided.
TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.
AB  - I retrospectively reviewed the records of 111 patients who had pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis unrelated to an open procedure on the spine. The mean age at the time of the diagnosis was sixty years (range, eighteen to eighty-four years); sixty-one patients (55 per cent) were sixty years old or more. Forty-four patients (40 per cent) had an impaired immune system secondary to diabetes mellitus, the use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy for cancer, rheumatic or immunological disease, renal or hepatic failure, malnutrition, or myelodysplasia. Magnetic resonance imaging, critical for the determination of an early diagnosis, was performed for 103 patients (93 per cent). The infection in sixty-eight patients (61 per cent) was diagnosed within one month after the onset of symptoms. The most frequent infecting organism was Staphylococcus aureus (forty patients; 36 per cent). The infection in forty-one patients (37 per cent) was caused by organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid species, that are traditionally considered to be of low virulence. The urinary tract was the most frequent source of infection (confirmed in thirteen patients and suspected in twenty-one). The success of non-operative treatment was predicted by four independent variables: an age of less than sixty years, the immune status, infection with Staphylococcus aureus, and a decreasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Forty-two patients were managed with debridement and arthrodesis. Fourteen of these patients also had instrumentation of the spine, in the presence of infection, without compromise of the outcome. Eighteen patients died by the time of the latest follow-up evaluation at a mean of four years (range, two years and two months to six years and six months): seven who had been managed non-operatively died in the first month after the diagnosis was made, three died in the acute postoperative period, three died of late complications of paraplegia, and five died of unrelated causes. None of the eighty-nine patients who were seen at a minimum of two years postoperatively had had late recurrence of infection. Chronic, severe back pain was noted in only seven patients.
TI  - IgG subclasses specific to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes in patients with acne vulgaris.
AB  - IgG subclasses specific to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were determined in sera from patients with mild, moderate or severe acne and from a control group. Titres specific to S. epidermidis were all within the same range and did not differ between groups. The titres of IgG subclasses to specific to P. acnes did vary between groups. IgG1 and IgG3 were significantly higher in severe acne patients compared with moderate acne patients, while IgG2 was significantly higher in moderate and severe patients compared with controls. Titres of IgG4 did not differ between groups. The pattern of titres observed suggests that, while the antibody response to S. epidermidis is relatively harmless, antibodies to P. acnes may be involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris.
TI  - Bacteraemia caused by periodontal probing.
AB  - Bacteraemia of oral origin may result in infective endocarditis in susceptible individuals. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the occurrence of bacteraemia due to periodontal probing. Thirty patients (15 male, 15 female; mean age 42.7 years) with untreated periodontitis were investigated. All were free of significant medical disorders and none had taken antibiotics in the previous month. Prior to and immediately following periodontal probing, 20 mL of venous blood were obtained from each patient and inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and incubated. Negative bottles were monitored continuously for three weeks before being discarded. Periodontal probing consisted of measuring pockets at six points around each tooth and recording the presence or absence of bleeding. A positive bacteraemia was recorded for three of the patients prior to probing. One patient exhibited Prevotella species whilst two exhibited skin commensals. Following probing, 13 patients (43 per cent) exhibited bacteraemia of oral origin. Viridans streptococci were the most common isolates (45 per cent). No significant correlations were found between bacteraemia and the severity of periodontitis or extent of bleeding on probing. The results indicate that periodontal probing can cause bacteraemia in patients with periodontitis. It would be advisable for patients considered at risk of developing infective endocarditis to receive antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal probing if they have radiographic evidence of periodontitis.
TI  - Identification and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from periapical lesions.
AB  - Periradicular tissues from 28 refractory endodontic cases requiring surgical intervention were submitted for histological diagnosis and microbiological culture. Bacteria isolated from these lesions were identified and then tested for their antibiotic sensitivity to a panel of common antibiotics. The periapical tissue specimens of 22 out of 28 lesions (79%) contained microorganisms. Of the 22 cases showing positive growth cultures, 15 were polymicrobial and 7 were single species isolates. Fifty-three different species were recovered: 29 anaerobes, 19 facultative anaerobes, and 5 aerobes. Microbes were observed under light microscopy in only one case. The most common organisms isolated were Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Wolinella recta, Fusobacterium species, and Clostridium species. Antibiotic susceptibility results showed no clear cut evidence of significant antibiotic resistance among the species tested. The results of this study seem to corroborate earlier studies regarding the microbial population of periapical lesions refractory to nonsurgical endodontics.
TI  - Presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the clinical features and results of conservative management in cases of presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. SETTING: L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated cases of presumed noninfectious endophthalmitis occurring after cataract surgery in a hospital-based population. Patients with minimal hypopyon and decreased visual acuity unassociated with pain, lid edema, conjunctival chemosis, corneal abscess, and obvious vitreous involvement were treated conservatively. The mainstays of treatment were topical and systemic steroids. Four eyes with clinical evidence of worsening required surgical intervention. Main outcome measures were resolution of inflammation and final visual acuity. RESULTS: In 23 of 27 patients, the inflammation resolved with medical therapy alone; 21 had a final visual acuity of 20/50 or better. In 3 of the 4 eyes that had surgery, the culture was positive for low virulent organisms; all had a satisfactory outcome. One eye with preoperative glaucoma developed absolute glaucoma with resolution of inflammation. CONCLUSION: Noninfectious endophthalmitis invariably presents with hypopyon and decreased vision unassociated with pain and lid edema. A trial of medical therapy with corticosteroids as the mainstay of treatment is often rewarding. Frequent monitoring and preparation for surgical intervention if required are key.
TI  - Microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  - Possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. In the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. To date, various bacterial species have been reported, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. Antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between February of 1993 and July of 1994 at the UCLA Medical Center. The implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and Dacron (6 percent). The implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). Of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. Forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then Escherichia coli (1.5 percent). No fungal infections were identified. Culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. The frequency (47 percent) and types (P. acnes and S. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.
TI  - [Sepsis following autologous blood transfusion].
AB  - Postoperatively, after an uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomy, a 58-year-old female patient developed the signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation and fever, which progressed to a septic shock. She received two units of autologous blood, one during and one after the operation. A blood culture from the patient and one unit of the autologous blood showed abundant growth of Pseudomonas cepacia and Serratia marcescens within 24 h and culture of this blood bag also showed slight growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis within 48 h. Culture of the second blood unit showed slight growth of Propionibacterium acnes. The source of bacterial contamination could not be identified. Autologous blood products thus also include a risk of infection that shouldn't be underestimated, and a strict medical indication to retransfusion is indispensable.
TI  - Influence of hemodilution on cefuroxime levels and bacterial contamination of intra- and postoperative processed wound blood during hip replacement.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of hemodilution on cefuroxime levels and bacterial contamination of processed shed blood during hip arthroplasty. 10 patients received cefuroxime 1,5 g as single shot prophylaxis before (group A), 10 after hemodilution (15 ml/KG) (group B). Cefuroxime levels in serum 1 h after administration, at the end of operation, after 12 h and in drainage-blood after 12 h were assessed by HPLC. Bacteriological study was performed from collecting bags (Vacufix), wound drainage blood and processed red blood cell concentrates, using pour plate technique and broth culture enrichment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean concentrations of cefuroxime were higher in group B than group A, but differed not significantly. No bacterial contamination was found in collecting bags and wound drainages in both groups. Processed red cell concentrates in group B showed no growth. In group A, however, 3/10 were contaminated with < or = CFU/ml of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes. The differences between groups did not reach the level of statistical significance and could not be related to lower cefuroxime levels. No wound infection occurred in either group.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in open fractures].
AB  - The administration of antibiotics is now generally accepted as a prophylactic treatment of infection in compound fractures. Nevertheless the question is not completely resolved and many problems are still to be discussed.The efficacy of antibiotherapy in this field has just been recently demonstrated ; with the animals by Worlock et al. (1988) using an experimental rabbit model, and clinically by Braul et al. (1987) which randomized 87 patients with open fractures to receive either cloxacillin or placebo. The rate of infection was significantly lower in the antibiotic group.No reports comparing various antimicrobial drugs draw effective conclusions regarding the choice of antibiotics. In the same way it seems that the time of interval from injury to antibiotic administration was not associated with a significantly different incidence of infection.The study of duration of the treatment was perfectly conducted by Dellinger. In his prospective trial 248 patients received different doses of the same antibiotic, from a single dose to four doses daily during 5 days. In conclusion he found no relation between the duration of the treatment and the risk of infection.A semantic but very important question concerns the reality of a preventive action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures. In order to answer, it is necessary to assess the incidence of contamination, its nature and its density.According to papers reporting the results of early cultures of the fracture wound, bacterial contamination was present in 30-70% of the cases. But the bacteria most commonly isolated were members of the normal skin flora (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium sp. Micrococcus) or environmental contaminants which infrequently were the cause of infection.The specimens taken from patients who have an infection show mostly hospitalacquired bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings emphasize the risk of colonization of the wound by nosocomial bacteria.In addition, it seems that the density of contamination may also be a determinant of subsequent clinical infection. Quantitative bacterial counts suggest a greater risk of infection when microorganisms were present in high number more than 105 colony forming unit per g. of tissue.In conclusion, the prophylactic action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures is well established, but many points are still subject to discussion and need further study. Furthermore antibioprophylaxis is only a complement to surgical treatment, debridement and immobilization, which remains of paramount importance.
TI  - Clinical significance of intracapsular fluid in patients' breast implants.
AB  - Clinical reports on the incidence and clinical significance of intracapsular fluid are lacking in the literature. It remains unknown whether the presence of intracapsular fluid has any relation to implant infection or colonization. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of intracapsular fluid, specifically, whether intracapsular fluid causes implant infection, implant rupture, or bacterial colonization. A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study. Our study demonstrated the presence of intracapsular fluid in 21 of 139 (15%) implants. Positive microbial cultures were identified in 39% of the implants in the positive intracapsular fluid group, compared to 43% in the negative fluid group. There was no statistically significant difference between these groups. Also, no adverse clinical relationship was demonstrated between local symptoms and presence of intracapsular fluid. There was, however, a positive trend toward the presence of fluid when implant shell types were nonsmooth (polyurethane and textured silicone implants). Further studies are indicated to elucidate the fluid production mechanism and possible secretory activity of prosthetic capsules interfacing the textured breast implant surface.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of tea-tree oil and its major components on Staphylococcus  aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Major components of two tea-tree oil samples were identified using thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography (TLC and GLC). Using a TLC-bioautographic technique, the tea-tree oils, terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and alpha-pinene were found to be active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes whereas cineole was inactive against these organisms. The MIC values of the three active compounds increased in the order alpha-terpineol < terpinen-4-ol < alpha-pinene for all three micro-organisms. MIC values of the tea-tree oils and terpinen-4-ol were lower for P. acnes than for the two staphylococci. This study supports the use of tea-tree oil in the treatment of acne, and demonstrates that terpinen-4-ol is not the sole active constituent of the oil.

TI  - In vitro modulation of keratinocyte-derived interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and  peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived IL-1 beta release in response to cutaneous commensal microorganisms.
AB  - The ability of a range of skin commensal microorganisms to modulate interleukin-1 (IL-1) release by cultured human keratinocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated by a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bioassays. Three fractions (formaldehyde-treated whole cells, culture supernatants, and cellular fractions) were prepared from Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Malassezia furfur serovar B. The levels of immunochemical IL-1 alpha released by cultured keratinocytes during coincubations with these microbial fractions ranged from 0 to 136 pg/ml and were maximal after 72 h. No microbial fraction consistently upregulated immunochemical IL-1 alpha release by freshly isolated keratinocytes from two donors and a transformed cell line, all of which produced the cytokine constitutively to various extents. Bioassays revealed that most of the IL-1 released was biologically inactive. In contrast, whole cells of formaldehyde-treated P. granulosum and S. epidermidis significantly stimulated release of IL-1 beta by PBMCs from three donors compared with the negative control (culture medium). Release was maximal at 24 h. Coincubation with intact cells of the yeast M. furfur significantly decreased levels of IL-1 beta below the values for the negative control by PBMCs from all three donors. There was good correlation between bioassay data and immunoassay data for IL-1 beta, and the depressive effect of M. furfur cells on cytokine production by all three cultures of PBMCs was mirrored in the levels of bioactive cytokine. This reduction in IL-1 beta release by PBMCs by M. furfur may provide an explanation why dermatoses thought to be caused by this yeast are essentially noninflammatory or only mildly inflammatory.
TI  - Delayed infections following posterior spinal instrumentation for the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
AB  - Ten patients who had been managed with posterior spinal arthrodesis and Texas Scottish Rite Hospital instrumentation because of idiopathic scoliosis had a delayed deep wound infection at an average of twenty-five months after the operation. The signs of infection included spontaneous drainage in eight patients and fluctuance in two patients. In addition, six patients--including five of the eight who had drainage--had mild pain in the back. The average erythrocyte sedimentation rate was thirty-nine millimeters per hour (range, nineteen to eighty-one millimeters per hour). The instrumentation was removed from all of the patients. In two patients, a pseudarthrosis that had not been noted on preoperative radiographs was noted intraoperatively; in both patients, the pseudarthrosis occurred at a level at which two hooks had been placed in one intervertebral space. Primary closure was performed in seven patients, and delayed primary closure was performed on the third postoperative day in three patients. All wounds healed uneventfully. Cultures of specimens taken from deep within the wound were positive for Propionibacterium acnes (five patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis (two patients), a rare coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (one patient), or Micrococcus varians (one patient). No organisms grew on culture of the specimen obtained from the remaining patient. Propionibacterium acnes required an extended period of incubation before identification. Antibiotics were administered parenterally to all of the patients after the removal of the hardware, and this treatment was followed by oral administration of antibiotics for nine of the patients. We suspect--but can not prove--that several of the delayed infections resulted from intraoperative seeding and remained subclinical for an extended period of time.
TI  - [Search for bacterial contamination of the aqueous humor during cataract surgery  with and without local antibiotic prophylaxis].
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial contamination of anterior chamber at the end of cataract surgery, was compared between two techniques: extracapsular extraction and phacoemulsification. The effectiveness of preoperative antibiotic eyedrops using Norfloxacine 0.3% (Chibroxine) was also evaluated. METHOD: The study focused on 101 patients grouped according to surgical technique and presence of preoperative antibiotic eyedrops. Conjunctival sampling was made the day prior the surgery, as well as in the operating room, after skin and conjunctival desinfection with povidone iodine in all the patients included in the study. Aqueous humour was collected at the end of surgery. RESULTS: Eight samples out of 101 were positive which represents 7.9% of the cases. In 75% of the cases, the anterior chamber aspirate showed a different germ or non-recurrent germ in the second conjunctival sample. None of the included patients developed endophthalmitis. The two most frequent pathogens were Propionibacterium acnes in 62.5% of the cases, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 50%. Another pathogen was found in a culture environment: Micrococcus roseus. In two samples, two different bacteria grew: Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Whatever the surgical technique, no statistically significant bacterial contamination was found. There was no significant statistical difference between patients who had local antibiotic eyedrops and those who did not. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the poor reliability of local antibiotic eyedrops to prevent surgical contamination. Furthermore performing an anterior chamber aspirate at the end of the surgery for risk patients would help the physician identify the pathogens involved in endophthalmitis in order to begin antibiotic treatment as soon as possible.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - Effects of benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin alone and in combination against antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant skin bacteria from acne patients.
AB  - Topical formulations of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide are popular and effective treatments for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Use of the former is associated with resistance gain in both skin propionibacteria and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas use of the latter is not. We evaluated the efficacy of a combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide against a total of 40 erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and skin propionibacteria in vitro. Using the checkerboard technique, five erythromycin resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes were inhibited synergistically or additively by the combination. Complete mutual indifference was exhibited between the drugs against the remaining 35 strains. However, erythromycin resistant staphylococci and propionibacteria were inhibited by the same concentration of benzoyl peroxide as erythromycin-sensitive strains. These results suggest that, although the combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide is not synergistic against the majority of erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and propionibacteria, the concomitant therapeutic use of both drugs should counteract the selection of erythromycin-resistant variants and reduce the number of pre-existing resistant organisms on the skin of acne patients.
TI  - Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient--a possible mechanism for the antibacterial action of azelaic acid in Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The effect of the topical acne treatment azelaic acid on the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH) of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in vitro at external pH values found on human skin (pH 4.0-6.0). Bacteria were grown in defined media using continuous culture and delta pH was estimated by measuring the accumulation of [14C] benzoic by the cells using flow dialysis. In both P. acnes and S. epidermidis the addition of 30 mM azelaic acid and the membrane active inhibitors nigericin (150 microM) and CCCP (150 microM) resulted in a rapid release of [14C] label into the dialysate indicating the dissipation of delta pH between external pH values of 4.0-6.0. The addition of 60 mM NaCl as an iso-osmotic control and 150 microM valinomycin did not induce the release of [14C] label. The addition of 30 mM azelaic acid reduced the delta pH of P. acnes by 44% at external pH 4.0 and 28% at external pH 6.0. In S. epidermidis 30 mM azelaic acid reduced delta pH by 88% at external pH 5.0 and 20% at external pH 6.0. Rapid loss of viability occurred in suspensions of P. acnes and S. epidermidis containing 30 mM azelaic acid at pH 4.0 with no viable cells recovered after 60 min incubation. At pH 6.0 little change in viable numbers of P. acnes and S. epidermidis were observed over a 2 h incubation period. The results indicate that the antibacterial activity of azelaic acid is associated with the perturbation of intracellular pH.
TI  - Periprosthetic bacteria and the breast implant patient with systemic symptoms.
AB  - This report presents seven women with breast implants who experienced systemic symptoms which resolved rapidly after implant removal. A hypothesis is that these symptoms (which have been labeled "silicone poisoning" or "silicone adjuvant disease") may actually be caused by periprosthetic bacteria which have generally been considered innocuous, e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis. In these cases, systemic symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, diarrhea, muscle aches, and arthralgia rapidly resolved after an antibacterial regimen plus implant removal without capsulectomy. Of cultures taken by swab in four patients, all were positive; of those taken by irrigation in three patients, one was positive. I believe that these patients' symptoms were real and offer the hypothesis that treatment of periprosthetic bacteria might explain rapid clinical improvement following explantation.
TI  - Concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.
AB  - PURPOSE: Eyes with concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment usually have a poor anatomic and visual outcome after treatment. The purpose of this study is to define the relation among the causative organism, the results of retinal detachment repair, and the final visual acuity. METHODS: Data were retrieved by a retrospective, computer-assisted review of the coded inpatient diagnoses from April 1987 through March 1992. RESULTS: This study included 16 patients (9 males, 7 females) ranging in age from 5 to 88 years (average, 58.7 years). Endophthalmitis was classified as exogenous in 13 (81%) patients and endogenous in 3 (19%). Two groups were identified: a virulent group that included eight (50%) patients (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, gram-negative, Bacillus), and a less-virulent group that included eight (50%) patients (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, fungal). The initial surgical procedure consisted of diagnostic vitreous fluid collection by pars plana vitrectomy (11 cases), anterior vitrectomy (1 case), or vitreous aspiration (4 cases). Additional initial adjunctive surgical procedures included pars plana lensectomy (2 cases), scleral buckling (6 cases), fluid-gas exchange (7 cases), and intraocular antibiotic injections (9 cases). In six (75%) of eight patients with endophthalmitis in the virulent group, the retina remained detached. However, in seven (88%) of eight patients with endophthalmitis in the less-virulent group, the retina remained reattached postoperatively, and the remaining patient had a stable, nonprogressive peripheral tractional retinal detachment. None of the eight patients with endophthalmitis in the virulent group retained a postoperative visual acuity of better than 3/200, and four (50%) lost all light perception. Five (62%) of the eight patients with endophthalmitis in the less-virulent group retained a postoperative visual acuity of 5/200 or better, and none lost all light perception. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment patients with virulent organisms have a poor prognosis. Visual and anatomic outcomes were better in the less-virulent group.
TI  - The antibiotic susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from acne.
AB  - We studied the susceptibility of antimicrobial agents to Propionibacterium acnes  (P. acnes) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) isolated from acne patients. We measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the following five drugs: roxithromycin (RXM), erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM), minocycline (MINO) and ofloxacin (OFLX), which are frequently used to treat acne and skin infections. We found many resistant strains of S. epidermidis and some resistant strains of P. acnes. There was a correlation between the resistance of S. epidermidis and the former therapy for acne, but no distinct correlation between the resistance of P. acnes and the former therapy for acne.
TI  - Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis following cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Report on nine patients.
AB  - Between 1987 and 1992, nine patients (three men and six women; mean age, 75 years) presented with chronic postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Eight patients were referred from another institution. The interval between IOL implantation and the beginning of intraocular inflammation averaged 5.6 months (range, 1-19 months). The referral diagnosis was "toxic lens" syndrome in seven patients. The main clinical findings were a hypopyon in the anterior chamber (n = 8) and in the capsule bag (n = 2), and "fibrosis" of the lens capsule (n = 7). In eight patients a vitrectomy was performed, combined with removal of the IOL in six cases and with a total posterior capsulectomy in five cases. Pathogenic organisms were identified in vitreous aspirate (6/8), in culture (3/3), and on histopathological examination (4/5) of lens capsule and included coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3, Staphylococcus epidermidis), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Streptococcus viridans (n = 1), Rhodococcus erythropodes and R. luteus (n = 1), and one hyphomycete (Alternaria alternata). In chronic recurrent intraocular inflammations following IOL implantation, an infectious agent should be excluded by diagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy including removal of the IOL and posterior capsulectomy.
TI  - Endophthalmitis in Auckland 1983-1991.
AB  - A review was made of 58 cases of suspected endophthalmitis presenting to Auckland Public Hospital between January 1983 and July 1991 (103 months). Thirty culture positive cases were found comprising 13 early onset postoperative, six delayed onset postoperative, five bleb-associated, four post-traumatic and two endogenous cases. The most frequent organism grown in postoperative endophthalmitis was Staphylococcus epidermidis. No conclusion could be reached as to the effectiveness of early versus delayed vitrectomy. Endophthalmitis due to S. epidermidis usually had a good prognosis while streptococcal endophthalmitis had a poor prognosis. Delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis most often had a good prognosis while bleb-associated endophthalmitis had a uniformly poor visual outcome. Two isolates responsible for cases of delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis, Propionibacterium acnes and Rhodococcus species, did not grow on agar plates until the seventh day of culture. Significant bacterial resistance to cephazolin was identified with 33% of Gram-positive and 75% of Gram-negative isolates resistant. Prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis is discussed.

TI  - Follicular concentrations of azelaic acid after a single topical application.
AB  - Follicular concentrations of azelaic acid (AzA) were determined in vivo using a rapid, non-invasive method, after a single topical application of 20% (w/w) AzA cream, in order to establish whether the in vitro antimicrobial effects observed in previous studies are relevant in vivo. Preweighed amounts of 20% (w/w) AzA cream were applied over demarcated areas on the forehead and back of nine young adults, and samples were taken over a period of 5 h. AzA was removed from the skin surface by washing with acetone, and follicular casts were collected using cyanacrylate gel. The samples were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, and the supernatants derivatized for analysis by HPLC. Although the results showed wide-ranging variability, the follicular concentration increased as the amount present on the surface declined. The maximum follicular concentrations of AzA attained ranged from 7.5 to 52.5 ng (micrograms of follicular casts)-1 and 0.5 to 23.4 ng (micrograms of follicular casts)-1 in samples taken from the back and forehead, respectively. Assuming an average density of follicular material of 0.9 g ml-1, the mean maximum follicular concentration attained on the back was between 36 and 251 mmol/l, and on the forehead was between 2 and 112 mmol/l, and indicates that the concentration of AzA attained in follicular casts after a single topical application is comparable with the concentration required to inhibit the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, in vitro.
TI  - Clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - To better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. Positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. Cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. Gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and Staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. Gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. Anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with Propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. Unexpected findings included the paucity of Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol combination. In vitro study of interactions observed against potential cutaneous strains].
AB  - The interaction type of chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol association (foaming solution DC 102/1, Laboratoires Pierre Fabre Medicament) have been studied according to the chess-board method, on microplate, by determining MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) (or MFC (Minimal Fungicidal Concentrations)) adjusted to T 72-150 AFNOR norm (dilution-neutralization, contact 5 mn) and computation of FBC (or FFC) Index. Trials were carried out against 18 hospital strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) and against 4 strains of the AF-NOR norm. MBC of chlorhexidine, against Staphylococci were included between 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, and between 25 and 200 micrograms/ml against the others strains. MBC of chlorocresol were included between 800 and 3,200 micrograms/ml. Against the 22 tested strains, 18 synergistic interactions (FBC Index < or = 0.75) were observed, with 4 to 8 reducing factor for chlorhexidine, and > or = 2 for chlorocresol. No antagonism was noted (maximal FBC Index = 1).
TI  - The incidence of bacteraemia following laryngeal mask insertion.
AB  - The incidence of bacteraemia following insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was investigated in one hundred fit patients. Four cultures were positive: three represented contamination with skin flora; the other was a microaerophilic streptococcus grown from an anaerobic culture bottle. Although this organism can be pathogenic, it may also represent contamination. Our findings suggest that significant bacteraemia on insertion of the LMA is uncommon and is probably no more than with oral intubation. Antibiotic prophylaxis is of doubtful benefit in these circumstances.
TI  - Comparisons of the bacterial flora in genital regions at non-pregnancy.
AB  - In the development of infectious diseases at non-pregnancy and at pregnancy, correlations between bacterial flora in the vagina and portio vaginalis and the ascending infections of those bacteria have recently been discussed. To clarify the cause of those infectious diseases, we studied the localization of microorganisms in genital regions. Patients undergone abdominal total hysterectomy (n = 172) were employed as subjects, and microorganisms isolated from 4 genital regions were studied. In addition, the preventive effect of cefmetazole (CMZ) against postoperative infections was analyzed in 479 cases including the hysterectomy cases mentioned above. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The isolation rate of microorganisms at non-pregnancy, from subjects of 30 to 69 years old, was 65.6% (82/125) in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 52.1% (25/48) in the cervical mucus, 7.3% (9/124) in the uterine cavity and 0% (0/47) in the ovarian surface. 2. Numbers of microorganisms isolated in each region were 99 strains in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 28 in the cervical mucus, 10 in the uterine cavity and none in the ovarian surface. Isolation of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria (60-89.3%) and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (7.1-30%) were varied in each region. Lactobacillus spp. (38 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (20 strains) and Propionibacterium acnes (10 strains) were isolated from vagina and portio vaginalis, and Lactobacillus spp. (17 strains) were the most often isolated bacteria from the cervical mucus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Influence of the pH-value on the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes in continuous culture.
AB  - A cutaneous isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes was grown in continuous culture at varying pH-values ranging from 5.0 to 8.5. In terms of the specific growth rate as well as the bacterial density during the plateau phase there were remarkable differences. In particular, Propionibacterium acnes grew much better in the pH 6.0 to 7.0 range than in a more acidic or alkaline milieu. Staphylococcus epidermidis resembled Staphylococcus aureus showing no major difference at pH 5.5 and 7.0. These findings substantiate the hypothesis that minor changes of the pH in the pH 5.5 to pH 6.0 range as to be induced by chemically neutral or alkaline skin cleansers on the human skin surface can increase the number of propionibacteria but not staphylococci remarkably due to the relative alkalinity by itself.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Posterior lens capsule abscess due to Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus  epidermidis following extracapsular cataract extraction.
AB  - A case of posterior lens capsular abscess occurring many months after an extracapsular cataract extraction is presented. This was caused by a mixed infection involving Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The significance of Staph epidermidis after such a long postoperative period is uncertain, but the case shows features typical of secondary endophthalmitis due to P acnes, including a long delay in onset and a grumbling course not brought under control by medical treatment. It supports the theory that the nidus of infection is localised in the posterior lens capsule by showing development of a visible capsular abscess with associated vitreous involvement. The subsequent removal of the capsule and vitreous, despite leaving the intraocular lens in place, led to complete resolution of the inflammation. Both organisms have previously been found to be sequestered in the posterior lens capsule by histological and microbiological examination of excised capsular specimens. It is important to consider them as possible causative agents in the formation of a postoperative capsular abscess.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriologic evaluation of OPC-7251 in patients with acne: a double-blind group comparison study versus cream base.
AB  - Twenty-eight patients with acne were assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with OPC-7251 (a new fluoroquinolone derivative) 1% cream or the cream base in a double-blind manner to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the drug on resident bacteria in the hair follicles and to evaluate clinical response. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 21 of the 28 acne patients. When the number of P. acnes was compared before and after treatment, the posttreatment P. acnes count in the OPC-7251 1% cream group was significantly (p = 0.000) reduced compared with that in the cream base group. OPC-7251 1% cream was also significantly (p = 0.019) superior to the cream base in terms of clinical response. P. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the acne lesions were selected for their susceptibility to various antibacterial agents. The minimal inhibitory concentration of OPC-7251 against P. acnes and S. epidermidis was 0.10 to 0.20 and 0.024 to 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively, which indicates that the drug has a potent antibacterial effect.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of cloxacillin prophylaxis in craniotomy: a one year follow-up study.
AB  - A previous prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study showed that cloxacillin prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of infection after craniotomy. The purpose of the present follow-up study was to find out whether the data on routine cloxacillin prophylaxis would confirm the decreased infection rate after craniotomy. During this 1-year study, 8 infections occurred after 201 operations (4.0%) in 175 patients. No prophylaxis was given during 17 operations in 15 patients; 4 infections occurred in this group. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes, all of which were sensitive to cloxacillin. We conclude that cloxacillin is beneficial as prophylaxis in patients undergoing craniotomy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - Peripheral teflon catheters. Potential source for bacterial contamination of orthopedic implants?
AB  - To detect low numbers of bacterial cells on Teflon catheters removed from peripheral veins, 74 catheter tips were incubated in thioglycollate media for up to ten days. Fifteen (20.3%) of the catheters were found to be culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from seven, Staphylococcus epidermidis from six, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis from one each, all common skin organisms associated with infection of implants. An increase in documentation of bacterial contamination resulted from incubating greater than 72 hours; this allowed the slower-replicating Propionibacterium acnes to grow to detectable numbers. Because of these findings and those of others, attention is focused on the peripheral vein conduit as a potential source for hematogenous seeding of implants with bacterial cells. Changing peripheral catheters within 24 hours is recommended to reduce the constant risk of occult bacteremia.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - Lymphokines and bacteria, that induce tumoricidal activity, trigger a different secretory response in macrophages.
AB  - The abilities of various macrophage-activating agents to trigger tumoricidal activity and/or the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin 6 (IL 6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) in bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes (BMM phi) in vitro were comparatively assessed. Induction of tumoricidal activity by lymphokines, that is only short-lived, was not associated with enhanced secretion of these activities by BMM phi; in contrast, incubation with heat-killed facultative intracellular bacteria resulted in persisting tumoricidal activity and in marked enhancement of the secretion of IL 6 and PGE2, but not of TGF beta activity. These findings support the concept that the pattern of the secretory response induced in macrophages by lymphokines differs from that triggered by bacteria and that the rapid decay of lymphokine-induced tumoricidal activity is not due to autocrine macrophage deactivation mediated by one of these agents alone.
TI  - [Comparative study of the bacterial flora in both uterocervical and uterine regions].
AB  - The relationship between indigenous bacterial floras in the lower genitals and the uterocervical region is of importance due to a barrier-like role against ascending infections through the mechanism of the localized protection at a boundary of the uterocervical region. Therefore, bacterial flora in the uterocervical and uterine regions was studied in cases for which gynecological operations were performed (n = 77). 1. Ratios of incidences of the detection of bacteria on the uterocervical and in the uterine regions were 50/77 (64.9%) and 6/77 (7.8%), respectively. When different age groups are compared, the detection ratio from the uterocervical region was high among patients in the 40 s, and all the cases in which bacteria were detected from the uterine region were in the 40 s. 2. Gram-positive bacteria were detected at a high ratio, and anaerobic bacteria were noted in the uterocervical region, and ratios of detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus sp. and Propionibacterium acnes were high. Six strains of Gram-positive bacteria and 1 strain of Candida sp. were noted in the uterine region. 3. When cefmetazole (CMZ) was administered for the prevention of the infections after these panhysterectomy cases examined here, no postoperative infectious diseases nor adverse reactions were noted.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - Effect of cloxacillin prophylaxis on the bacterial flora of craniotomy wounds.
AB  - During a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effect of cloxacillin prophylaxis in craniotomies on samples taken for culture from 334 operation wounds in 279 patients was assessed. Patients and operations were equally divided over the cloxacillin and placebo groups. In the cloxacillin group significantly fewer samples contained microorganisms than was the case in the placebo group both just after the incision was made (p less than 0.05) and just before closure of the wound (p less than 0.001). The contaminating bacteria found most frequently were Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For material collected immediately after the incision, the percentage of cultures positive for S. epidermidis was significantly (p = 0.001) lower in the cloxacillin group than in the placebo group; the percentage of cultures with P. acnes did not differ between the two groups. For samples taken just before the wound was closed, the percentage of cultures with P. acnes or S. epidermidis was significantly (p = 0.008 and 0.003, respectively) lower in the cloxacillin than in the placebo group. In the placebo group neurosurgical infections occurred with P. acnes and/or S. epidermidis as causative microorganisms; in almost all cases those bacteria could be cultured from the edge of the wound. In none of the patients with an infection caused by S. aureus was the bacteria found in the operation area. In 2/6 infections in the cloxacillin group the infecting microorganisms could be cultured from the operation area. These findings support a significant reduction in the infection rate after craniotomy under cloxacillin prophylaxis compared with placebo.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Nontoxic concentration of ceftazidime and flomoxef sodium for intravitreal use--evaluated by in-vitro ERG.
AB  - The effects of ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef sodium (FMOX) on the in-vitro electroretinogram (ERG) of albino rabbits were studied. The a-wave, the b-wave and the oscillatory potential (OP) were unchanged by 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ-containing solution. The OP was suppressed by 0.5mM (0.32mg/ml) CAZ. The a-wave, the b-wave and the OP were unchanged by 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX. The OP was suppressed and its peak latency was delayed by 2mM (0.52mg/ml) FMOX. The concentration of 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ was higher than its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes. The concentration of 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX was higher than its MIC against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes.
TI  - Activity of capryloyl collagenic acid against bacteria involved in acne.
AB  - Synopsis Capryloyl collagenic acid (Lipacide C8Co) has similar bacteriostatic activity in vitro to that of benzoyl peroxide towards the bacteria found in acne lesions (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) (MIC between 1 and 4 mg ml(-1) for C8Co, and between 0.5 and 5 mg ml(-1) for benzoyl peroxide). The presence of Emulgine M8 did not affect the bacteriostatic activity of C8Co. A 4% w/v solution of C8Co (incorporating Emulgine M8) fulfilled the criteria for an antiseptic preparation as laid down by the French Pharmacopoeia (10th Edition), and had a spectrum 5 bactericidal activity according to the French Standard AFNOR NF T 72-151. The excellent cutaneous tolerance of capryloyl collagenic acid would indicate that an aqueous solution might be of value for topical treatment of the bacterial component of acne. Resume Activite antibacterienne de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique vis a vis des bacteries impliquees dans l'etiologie de l'acne L'acide capryloyl-collagenique (Lipacide C8Co) et le peroxyde de benzoyle presentent une activite bacteriostatique in-vitroequivalente vis a vis des especes bacteriennes retrouvees au niveau des lesions acneiques (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis et Propionibacterium acnes) (CMI comprise entre 1 et 4 mg ml(-1) pour le lipoaminoacide, et 0,5 et 5 mg ml(-1) pour le peroxyde de benzoyle). La mise en solution aqueuse de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique en presence d'Emulgine M8 ne modifie pas son activite bacteriostatique. Une telle solution, a 4% m/V d'acide capryloyl-collagenique et 5% m/V d'Emulgine M8, satisfait a l'essai d'activite des preparations antiseptiques decrit a la Pharmacopee Francaise (Xeme Ed.) (concentration minimale antiseptique: 10% v/V, pour un temps de contact de 5 min a 32 degrees C entre les germes tests et la solution diluee en eau distillee), et possede une activite bactericide antiseptique spectre 5 conforme a la norme AFNOR NF T 72-151 (concentration minimale bactericide: 40% v/V). Cette activite antiseptique est diminuee par l'augmentation du pH, mais demeure significative a pH 5,5, pH moyen du revetement cutane. Compte tenu de la bonne tolerance cutanee de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique, cette solution pourrait constituer une base interessante pour une preeparation dermique destinee au traitement local de la composante bacterienne de l'acne.
TI  - Analysis of the proinflammatory property of epidermal cyst contents: chemotactic  C5a anaphylatoxin generation.
AB  - We investigated in vitro the contents of epidermal cysts for complement activation and found that they activated complement mainly through the alternative pathway. Chemotactic C5a anaphylatoxin produced by the cyst contents after contact with serum most likely plays a significant role in the initiation and aggravation of inflammation in ruptured epidermal cysts. Our additional study disclosed that components of three representative follicular resident microorganisms (Pityrosporum ovale, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) also produced C5a anaphylatoxin mainly through the alternative pathway; the C5a production was more vigorous than that by a virulent pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest that accidental colonization of the cyst contents by these follicular microbial flora further augments the inflammatory changes in ruptured epidermal cysts.
TI  - Phototoxicity of skin microorganisms tested with a new model.
AB  - A new standardized method for testing phototoxicity of chemicals against microorganisms is described. The inoculum size of the microorganism, application of test chemicals, prediffusion time, incubation time and incubation period are defined. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Pityrosporum orbiculare were studied. Both 8-methoxypsoralen and trimethylpsoralen were phototoxic against all microorganisms tested, while tetracycline and doxycycline were not phototoxic. C. albicans may be chosen for phototoxicity testing because it has been used earlier, it is easy to maintain in culture, it grows easily when tested, and its pathogenicity is low. The phototoxicity of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, C. albicans, and P. orbiculare against each other were also investigated. Only P. orbiculare was inhibitory. It inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Ps. aeruginosa - both in the dark and after irradiation. The growth inhibition was markedly enhanced after UVA irradiation, indicating phototoxicity. The phototoxic effect of P. orbiculare may play a role in the ecology of the human skin flora.
TI  - The production of inflammatory compounds by Propionibacterium acnes and other skin organisms.
AB  - Culture supernatants from four species of skin microorganisms (P. acnes, P. avidum, P. granulosum and S. epidermidis) were assayed for smooth muscle contracting substances which are indicative of inflammatory activity. At least three types of smooth muscle contracting substances were detected. These were: first, a substance active on a rat fundic strip preparation and antagonized by N,N-DMT. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of tryptophan. This substance was probably tryptamine. Second, a substance active on a guinea-pig ileum preparation and antagonized by mepyramine. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of histidine. This substance was probably histamine. Third, a substance active on a rat fundic strip preparation but not antagonized by N,N-DMT, mepyramine, atropine or indomethacin. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of glucose. This activity was probably due to acetate, propionate or other short-chain fatty-acid salts. Chromatographic analysis confirmed the presence of histamine, tryptamine and short-chain fatty acids in the culture supernatants. These substances if produced in vivo may cause or contribute to inflammation and pain directly without the prior mediation of the immune system. Cell extracts of Propionibacterium species were analysed by bioassay for the presence of prostaglandin-like compounds. These could not be detected in any of the eight strains of organisms tested.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in healthy young men.
AB  - The nasal cavity of 97 young healthy men (applicants for the pilot education in the Finnish Air Force) was examined. Bacterial culture demonstrated one or more species of aerobic bacteria in all 194 nasal cavities examined and anaerobic bacteria in 76.5%. In ten per cent of the cultures bacteria were detected after enrichment only. The most common aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (79%), diphtheroids (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (34%). Haemophilus influenzae was found in 5% and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 0.5%. Anaerobic culture yielded Propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and Peptococcus magnus in 3.5%.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial effect of azelaic acid.
AB  - Various strains of cutaneous micro-organisms were tested in vitro for their survival rates in 0.5 mol/l (8.4% w/v) azelaic acid solution. All bacterial strains exhibited large reductions in viability (at least 40-fold) over a 24 h test period, but little response was noted with Pityrosporum ovale. The bactericidal effect of azelaic acid was reduced considerably in the presence of nutrients. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal (or fungicidal) concentrations (MBCs) were also determined. MICs varied from 0.03 mol/l to 0.25 mol/l; MBCs were all either 0.25 mol/l or greater.
TI  - Response of bacterial antigen in palmoplantar pustulosis.
AB  - Motilities of leukocytes in response to bacterial antigens or sera were examined  in tissues from patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Accelerated migration towards bacterial antigens was detected in the case of Staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 of 19 patients, to Propionibacterium acnes in 5 of 19, to Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus in 3 of 19, while no acceleration was found in neutrophils from the controls. A significantly accelerated migration of normal lymphocytes in response to both patients' and control sera was nil. Inhibition of migration of guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells mixed with lymphocytes from PPP patients was detected in 12 out of 14 patients with the addition of S. epidermidis antigen and 8 of 14 with the addition of P. acnes antigen, while no such inhibition was detected in all 7 controls. The accelerated migration of neutrophils and inhibition of macrophages may participate in the development of PPP.

TI  - Infections after craniotomy: a retrospective study.
AB  - A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the rate of infection directly related to craniotomy. Of 246 craniotomies performed in 1981, 234 could be evaluated. The overall incidence of infection was 8.1% (19 infections in 18 patients). The infection rate was 15.2% after insertion of a ventricular shunt (seven infections after 45 ventriculostomies). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were the most frequent isolated micro-organisms. We recommended a double-blind prospective study to evaluate the possible benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in craniotomies.
TI  - The microbial flora of the continent cecal urinary reservoir, its stoma and the peristomal skin.
AB  - The bacteria occurring in reservoir urine, on the cutaneous stoma and on the abdominal skin were studied in 9 patients who had undergone urinary diversion via a continent cecal reservoir. Aerobic and/or facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated persistently from reservoir urine in 3 patients but only occasionally in the remainder. These organisms were isolated in pure culture. Anaerobic bacteria also were found, although infrequently and only in conjunction with facultative anaerobes. Most stomal cultures showed heavy growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fewer microbes were isolated in the abdominal skin cultures. Propionibacterium acnes, present in most skin cultures, was absent or scantily represented on the stoma. Microbial antibiosis was demonstrated in vitro between stomal and urinary reservoir bacteria in 6 patients. However, bacteria from stomal isolates had no antagonistic effect against bacteria belonging to the family of Enterobacteriacae or against anaerobic species isolated from urine. Antibiosis may influence the microbial ecology of the urine reservoir and cutaneous stoma.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. Protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. Host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. Microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. Nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. Microorganisms including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. Protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
TI  - Evaluation of the sterility and stability of insulin from multidose vials used for prolonged periods.
AB  - Diabetic patients frequently use their insulin vials for prolonged periods, even  though antibacterial preservatives used in multidose insulin vials are not required to be effective beyond 28 days. For this reason, we evaluated the antibacterial activity present in multidose insulin vials for up to 50 days. Multidose lente insulin vials were inoculated with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Vials incubated at room temperature (21 degrees C) were sterile by 48 hours, whereas when they were incubated at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees C), S. aureus contamination persisted up to the 17th day and P. aeruginosa were killed after 10 days. The same vials were serially contaminated on days 17, 30, and 50, and a similar antibacterial effect was maintained. Sixty-nine multidose insulin vials used for an average of 53 days were cultured. Eight vials demonstrated bacterial contamination with 1 cfu/ml of S. epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes. No endotoxin was detected in the multidose vials used for more than 28 days. Insulin assays on 40 multidose insulin vials used for more than 28 days showed an average insulin content of 101.6 +/- 1.9 units/ml. This study did not demonstrate significant bacterial contamination, endotoxin activity, or insulin degradation of multidose insulin in vials used for periods longer than 28 days. In addition, antibacterial preservatives were more effective at room temperature than at refrigerator temperature; thus, the practice of patients not refrigerating insulin vials is sensible.
TI  - Cytotoxic activity of Propionibacterium acnes and other skin organisms.
AB  - Culture supernatants from four species of skin micro-organisms were tested against VERO (monkey kidney cells) and skin fibroblasts for cytotoxic activity. Cytotoxic activity was produced by the three species of Propionibacterium tested (P. acnes, P. avidum and P. granulosum), and this activity was highest when cultures were grown in the presence of glucose. In contrast, Staphylococcus epidermidis was devoid of cytotoxic activity whether grown in the presence of glucose or not. The agent responsible for the cytotoxic activity was heat stable, of low molecular weight and removable from supernatants by ether extraction. These properties, coupled with the finding that the levels of cytotoxicity are directly proportional to the concentrations of propionate measured in samples, suggests that propionate is the agent responsible for the cytotoxicity of the culture supernatants. Pure propionate and the salts of other carboxylic acids (CI to C5) were tested at the same concentrations and showed different degrees of cytotoxicity depending on their chain length. Propionate may have an important role in the aetiology of the disease acne vulgaris.
TI  - Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes to killing and degradation by human neutrophils and monocytes in vitro.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes, the target of inflammation in acne, was tested for its sensitivity to the bactericidal and degradative functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), monocytes, and their fractions. P. acnes strains were not killed by PMN under any conditions and were variably killed by monocytes in the presence of serum from acne patients. Control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeicticus were susceptible to both PMN and monocyte killing. P. acnes strains were also not killed by lysozyme, chymotrypsin, H2O2, human serum, PMN granule lysate, and PMN and monocyte cell lysates. The organism was sensitive to the bactericidal activity of myeloperoxidase in acid pH. In addition, P. acnes was shown to be relatively resistant to the degradative action of PMN and monocyte lysates, whereas M. lysodeicticus, S. aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were all degraded to various degrees. The moieties that were liberated from P. acnes by PMN enzymes were predominantly low in molecular weight (1,000 to 25,000) and were consistent with cell wall fragments.

TI  - Intradermal injection of Propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  - The intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of Propionibacterium acnes (CN 6134)  into the ears of female Sprague-Dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with formation of acneiform lesions. Inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. At 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. Histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. Pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. By day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. Three isolates of P. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain CN 6134. In these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. In contrast, samples of Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli B, and Staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. Benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of P. acnes CN 6134-induced ear thickening. The corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. The specificity for P. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.
TI  - Changes in the bacterial flora of the external ear canal from the wearing of occlusive equipment.
AB  - External otitis has been associated with wearing obstructive gear covering the earlobe and external ear canal. In this study we investigated the changes in the bacterial flora of the external ear canal after wearing rubber hoods. The bacterial flora of external ear canals surfaces was investigated in a group of 19 volunteers who wore rubber hoods for a period of 25 to 30 minutes while doing manual work. The protective effect of 2% acetic acid was tested by instilling it in the left ear of all participants. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci were the predominant isolates from the ear samples. After hoods were worn, there was a substantial increase in the number of these organisms in 7 (36.8%) of the external ears. However, an increase in the bacterial counts in the external ear canals occurred in only 2 (10.5%) of the individuals treated prophylactically with acetic acid drops (P less than 0.02).
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in neurosurgical infections. Per-operative culture with flexible contact agar film.
AB  - Fourteen of 80 patients (17.5 per cent) who underwent elective craniotomy preceded by a strict pre-operative routine of skin decontamination contracted postoperative wound infection. Most of the infections were probably from endogenous sources and from eight of the wounds low-virulent resident skin bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes and/or Staphylococcus epidermidis, were isolated. Since thorough pre-operative preparation of the skin did not reduce the incidence of infection to an acceptable level, antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated in this type of surgery.
TI  - Acetic, propionic, and oleic acid as the possible factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/mL or more at any pH tested (pH 5.5-6.8). While the MIC of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the pH of the media and at pH 5.5, the mean pH value of the normal human skin, the MIC was 6.25 mg/mL or less. The MIC of oleic acid for some strains of Gram-positive transient bacteria of Streptococcus, Micrococcus, or Bacillus was 100 micrograms/mL or less at all pH's tested. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to this acid at pH 6.8, but became as sensitive as Streptococcus when the pH was lowered. The growth of P. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/mL of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/mL of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/mL of oleic acid. On the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the forehead and back of Alaskan native villagers in summer and in winter.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the forehead and back of Eskimo and Indian villagers in arctic Alaska was determined in midsummer and in winter (temperature -29 degrees to -46 degrees C). Specimens collected by the wet swab method were transported overnight, chilled, to Seattle in buffered diluent with Triton X-100. Control tests showed good survival of principal skin organisms with moderate or large initial populations and a disproportionately greater loss with an initial sparse population. Results of these studies are compared with earlier studies of the forehead flora of a Seattle urban population. On most Alaskan subjects Propionibacterium acnes was more abundant than staphylococci on both sites and both organisms had greater population densities on the forehead than on the back. Population densities for P. acnes varied from none detected to more than 10(6) per cm2 on the forehead and 10(5) per cm2 on the back. For coagulase-negative staphylococci the range was from none detected to more than 10(5) per cm2 on the forehead and the back. The proportion of subjects with relatively abundant or relatively sparse populations of P. acnes and of staphylococci did not change seasonally. Of 51 staphylococcal isolates, 65% were S. epidermidis, 22% S. capitis, and 10% S. hominis. P. saccharolyticus was found on a minority of subjects on both sites. The kinds of organisms found on the forehead and their variable individual population densities were essentially the same on the Alaskan villagers and the Seattle subjects.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  - Aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). A total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). There were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including Hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). Fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and Propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).
TI  - The effect of benzoyl peroxide on cutaneous micro-organisms in vitro.
AB  - The survival curves of cutaneous micro-organisms in the presence of benzoyl peroxide were investigated. All the curves exhibited a shoulder prior to exponential cell death. Benzoyl peroxide was lethal to the cutaneous organisms tested and they varied in sensitivity increasing as follows: Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus capitis, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. hominis, Prop. avidum, Prop. granulosum and Pityrosporum ovale.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Effect of diving and diving hoods on the bacterial flora of the external ear canal and skin.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the external ear canals and posterior auricular skin surfaces were investigated in a group of 26 divers after 25 dry-suit dives in harbor water and 20 dry-suit dives in clear test tank test. A control group of 16 divers wore rubber hoods 19 times for a similar period (25 to 30 min) but did not dive. The protective effect of 2% acetic acid was tested by instilling it in the left ear of 14 divers and 8 nondivers. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and enteric gram-negative rods were the predominant isolates from skin and ear samples. After the divers dove or after they wore hoods without going in the water, there was a substantial increase in the number of these organisms on the skin (46.9%) or in the external ears (43.8%) of the divers. However, an increase in the bacterial counts in the external ear canals occurred in only 13.6% of the individuals treated prophylactically with acetic acid drops. Although no gram-negative rods were recovered from the skin or external ear canals of divers in clear tank water, 23 strains were isolated after the dives in harbor water. Identical gram-negative isolates also were recovered from the harbor water. Gram-negative organisms also were recovered from three newly acquired skin lacerations, where they persisted for at least 24 h. Our data show the acquisition of gram-negative rods when dives were made in polluted water. The data also demonstrate the increase in bacterial counts that occurs when rubber diving rods are worn (in or out of water) and that this increase can be controlled by pretreatment of ears with acetic acid.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in gerbils and chinchillas with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - To ascertain the usefulness of Mongolian gerbils as an inbred model for otitis media, 52 Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus, strain MONT/Tum) were compared with 26 chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) for susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a polymicrobic culture including anaerobes (Streptococcus intermedius, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium sp.). Organisms were inoculated percutaneously into the superior chamber of the middle ear bulla. The gerbils and chinchillas shared similar susceptibilities and responses to the inoculated organisms as determined by X-ray, otoscopic, histopathological, and microbiological determinations at 5 to 7 days. Koch's postulate studies proved the role of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the pathology found in both animal models. The animals were also susceptible to the polymicrobic culture, although the relative virulence of the individual members of this mixture was low, suggesting that these species potentiated as a polymicrobic mixture. The Corynebacterium sp. appeared to elicit the greatest histopathological response in chronic (8-week) studies in gerbils. The gerbils were found to be useful as an alternative animal model for the study of otitis media of bacterial etiology.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in deep infections after total hip arthroplasty: differential diagnosis between infectious and non-infectious loosening.
AB  - Five separate biopsy samples for bacterial culture were taken at primary total hip arthroplasty in patients without signs of infection and at reoperation of patients with infectious and noninfectious loosening of the prosthesis. Based on the results of the culture, on serologic results and on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, bacteria of clinical significance could be distinguished from contaminants. Growth in one or two of five biopsy samples was a strong indicator of contamination, while growth in five of five biopsy samples of one or two bacterial species strongly indicated an infection. These diagnostic procedures are applied to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious loosening of the prosthesis. In the delayed infections, the low-virulent aerobic and anaerobic bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and peptococci were predominant.
TI  - Bacteriologic investigation and histologic observations of variably acid-fast bacteria in three cases of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.
AB  - Skin biopsy specimens from 3 consecutive patients with lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin were cultured for bacteria, and also examined histopathologically for the presence of acid-fast wall deficient (CWD) bacteria. Corynebacterium sp and Propionibacterium acnes were isolated from two repeated cultures from the first case. Both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus viridans were isolated from the second case. Bacteriologic culture of the third case was negative. Utilizing the Intensified Kinyoun stain for the detection of acid-fast CWD bacteria, variably acid-fast coccoid forms were visualized in the tissue sections from two cases. In one case, the Gram strain revealed similar forms. Newer knowledge linking CWD bacterial forms of staphylococci, streptococci, and corynebacteria-like microbes to cryptic infection of human blood is discussed, as well as the possible role of CWD bacteria in the pathogenesis of malignancy. This study suggests that CWD microbes might play a role in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, and that the presence of microbes might be detected by bacteriologic culture of KS lesions, and acid-fast histologic staining of skin biopsy specimens.
TI  - New medium for isolating propionibacteria and its application to assay of normal  flora of human facial skin.
AB  - The conditions for isolation and cultivation of Propionibacterium acnes and related propionibacteria were studied in detail. Triton X-100 added to the diluent inhibited the growth of propionibacteria in concentrations of 0.05 to 0.1%. However, such was not the case with Tween 80; rather, growth of the bacteria was further enhanced by this agent. Consequently, Tween 80 was considered to be a suitable surfactant for addition to the diluent for isolation of propionibacteria. A new medium for isolating propionibacteria from human skin was developed. Comparative studies with colonies of P. acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed morphological differences among the colonies; thus, the medium was very useful for differentiating and identifying species of the microbes. The new medium was used for studies on the distribution of propionibacteria on the foreheads of 30 Japanese volunteers. Among 447 strains of P. acnes and 86 strains of P. granulosum isolated from the volunteers, all strains of the former were positive for indole, nitrate, milk, and gelatin hydrolysis, whereas all strains of the latter were negative for all of the tests.
TI  - In vitro effects of skin lipid extracts on skin bacteria in relation to age and acne changes.
AB  - Skin lipid extracts of 185 persons of different age were tested in vitro against  single representatives of skin bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, P. granulosum and Corynebacterium sp. in order to find differences in their inhibitory effects. Percentages of the extracts inhibiting the first 4 bacteria were nearly the same (about 20%) while corynebacteria were inhibited by only 3 extracts. Extracts showing these properties were isolated mainly from adolescents with acne changes, young adults, about 20 yr old, and from children 8--10 yr old, but not from elderly people. The age-related differences in growth inhibition may be related to known differences in relative composition of the sebum constituents according to age. Forty-two extracts of acne patients and healthy adults and adolescents showed an inverse effect in vitro: they enhanced bacterial growth. Growth enhancement was demonstrated only for P. granulosum.
TI  - Antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  - The significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. Cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. Isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. Furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. The results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. There is some evidence that specific IgM and IgG as well as IgA responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. These results suggest that coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. Whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. One very interesting point is the presence of IgF coating of organisms in some effusions.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Cytotaxin production by comedonal bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum and Staphylococcus epidermidis).
AB  - The potential role of different species of comedonal bacteria as chemotactic stimuli in the inflammatory phase of acne vulgaris was investigated by comparing 12 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 11 strains of Propionibacterium acnes, and 5 strains of P. granulosum for production of cytotaxin in vitro. Results indicated that not only were there marked differences in cytotaxin production between different strains of the same species grown under identical growth conditons, but there were often significant differences in cytotaxin activity of the same strain grown in different media. This finding is discussed in relation to development of inflammation in quiescent comedones in acne vulgaris.
TI  - Is there postdefecation bacteremia?
AB  - An investigation was done to determine the incidence of postdefecation bacteremia. A study of 82 healthy volunteers was done. Among 164 predefecation cultures, only one (0.6%) from an anaerobic flask was positive for microorganism, which was identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. In only two of 328 (0.6%) postdefecation cultures did microorganisms grow, which were shown to be Propionibacterium acnes. The results of this study suggest that either bacteremia after defecation does not occur or is a rare event in healthy individuals.
TI  - The feasibility of replacing antibiotics by quaternary ammonium compounds in topical antimicrobial acne therapy.
AB  - Determinations of the minimum inhibitory concentrations for various antimicrobial surfactants with reference to the bacteria P. acnes, P. granulosum, and St. epidermidis are reported. The results show that quaternary ammonium compounds can display minimum inhibitory concentrations corresponding to those of relevant antibiotics. With the especially effective substance fractionated dimethylcocobenzalkoniumchloride )ARQUAD DMMCD-B), it could be further shown that with in vivo application in 70% isopropanol or in an ethanol-containing film mask ointment suppression can be obtained of P. acnes, all propionibacteria added, and all pilosebaceous duct bacteria which can be cultured under anaerobic conditions. The studies may point out a way of replacing antibiotics in the antimicrobial therapy of acne by quaternary ammonium compounds.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. Four hundred seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. The cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. The conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. The predominant aerobes isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and Haemophilus vaginalis. The predominant anaerobes were the Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptococcus, other Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus organisms. Statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.
TI  - Intergeneric and intrageneric inhibition between strains of Propionibacterium acnes and micrococcaceae, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, isolated from normal skin and acne lesions.
AB  - Two hundred and forty-one strains or resident skin bacteria comprising 93 isolates of Propionob acterium acnes and 148 of Micrococcaceae derived from 36 acne patients and 8 control subjects were screened for their ability to inhibit 32 indicator strains, including 20 strains of P. acnes and 12 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis derived from patients with all grades of acne and from normal skin. Fifty-three strains (22%) showed some activity against at least one indicator strain. Both broad- and narrow-spectrum inhibition was detected. Inhibitory isolates of P. acnes outnumbered inhibitory Micrococcaceae by four to one. There was a low frequency of inhibition of S. epidermidis by Micrococcaceae (2.7%) and by P. acnes (1.1%) and a higher frequency of inhibition of P. acnes by Micrococcaceae (9.5%) and by P. acnes (40.8%). Furthermore, 81.8% of the subjects sampled possessed strains inhibitory to P. acnes. The significance of this finding is, as yet, unknown. No difference in the prevalence of active strains in normal (20%) and acne (22.5%) skin was detected. These findings suggest that the possession of inhibitory strains and conversely the possession of sensitive strains does not predispose to acne.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Anaerobic flora of the normal human conjunctival sac.
AB  - Specimens from the conjunctival sacs of 92 healthy eyes were cultured on two separate occasions to determine the presence or absence of a persistent anaerobic flora. Aerobic bacteria and fungi were also studied for comparison. Of the 184 eye cultures, 112 (60.9%) contained at least one microorganism. Obligate anaerobes were recovered from 51.6% (95/184) of the cultures. Propionibacterium acnes, the predominant anaerobe encountered, was present in 49.5% (91/184) of the eyes. Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, present in 32.6% of the total eye cultures, were less common than obligate anaerobes. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common of these. Fungi were rarely found. Our findings suggest that the conjunctival sac is either sterile or normally contains small numbers of anaerobic, aerobic, or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. As other workers have suggested, the origin of the bacteria in the eyes may be the skin of the eyelids.
TI  - Bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  - During 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. Blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. The mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. Sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). Twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: Streptococcus (5 species), Lactobacillus sp, Veillonella alcalescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Corynebacterium acnes, and Bacillus subtilis. Seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. There was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. A follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
TI  - The bacteriology of skin cysts.
AB  - Thirty-nine clinically uninflamed cysts of the three most common varieties, epidermoid cysts, trichilemmal cysts and steatocystoma multiplex were removed under sterile conditions and the contents cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Seventy-three percent of epidermoid cysts grew significant numbers of organisms whereas none of the trichilemmal cysts did so. The organisms found were the common skin commensals, Staphylococcus epidermidis biotype I, anaerobic Gram positive cocci of the Gaffya type and Corynebacterium acnes Type I. This indicates that cysts which clinically have a punctum, namely epidermoid cysts, may become colonized with surface bacteria under normal circumstances. If they become colonized with pathogenic bacteria they become inflamed, a not uncommon clinical picture. The results from patients with steatocystoma multiplex were difficult to interpret because of the small numbers of patients involved and the unusual clinical appearance they presented.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in otitis media.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria, Peptostrepotococcus intermedius and Propionibacterium acnes,  were found in mixed culture specimens from four to ten tested cases of chronic secretory otitis media. These anaerobic bacteria were in a mixed infection flora with aerobic bacteria most often Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cornybacterium sp. which do not fit any established species. The findings of anaerobic bacteria in otitis media is consistent with the sporadic report of the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in otitis media in the literature since 1898.
TI  - A special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  - A 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. There is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. Three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. Another died. At autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. The deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The autopsy findings showed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of SCID. After a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (DV) was placed in the isolator. Laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. The patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. Subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four HLA matches but none has been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. Approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. Those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), Bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, Clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), Bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-Alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Microcossu sp. subgroup 1, Bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-Candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). Seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: P. acnes, C. bifermentans, B. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, E. agglomerans, C. parapsilosis. No viruses or protozoa have been isolated. At age 3 years, the mean quantitation of anaerobic cells was 7.9 X 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. The mean aerobic concentration was 1.2 X 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. Qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. This child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...
TI  - Further observations on the diagnosis cause, and treatment of endophthalmitis.
AB  - In our study of 54 suspected cases of endophthalmitis, vitreous aspiration was more sensitive in making a culture-proven diagnosis than anterior chamber paracentesis; Staphylococcus epidermidis was a more common cause of endophthalmitis than previously appreciated; and intraocular antibiotics in the recommended dosage are reasonably safe clinically and add a new dimension to the treatment of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Study of elastolytic activity Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermis in acne vulgaris and in normal skin.
AB  - Histopathological sections of anetoderma-like scars from 10 patients with acne vulgaris showed a selective absence of elastic fibers around pilosebaceous follicles. This finding is similar to the histologic changes of "perifollicular elastolysis" reported by Varadi. Bacteria isolated by anaerobic and aerobic cultures of swabs of the skin surface and pus of these 10 patients, 12 others with active acne vulgaris and 8 normal subjects were studied with particular attention to Staphylococcus epidermis and Propionibacterium acnes. These organisms were analysed for production of an elastolytic enzyme which might play a role in the observed selective loss of elastic fibers. No elastolytic activity was produced by S. epidermidis or P. acnes isolated from any of these individuals. Thus, we cannot attribute the perifollicular loss of elastic fibers in acne scarring to an elastase produced by organisms. The observed absence of elastic fibers might result from tissue necrosis produced by leukocytes during the inflammatory phase, followed by collagenous scar formation without regeneration of elastic fibers.
TI  - Esterification of (4--14C)cholesterol by cutaneous bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Propionibacterium granulosum).
AB  - Cholesterol and cholesteryl esters constitute 3 to 5% of the lipids derived from  human sebaceous glands. The present study demonstrates that cutaneous bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and to a lesser extent Propionibacterium acnes, and Propionibacterium granulosum, esterify [4--14C]cholesterol to steryl esters in vitro. The degree of esterification is a characteristic of the strain of organism, ranging from 0 to 32.7% in the organisms tested. Cholesterol esterification in these experiments was dependent on the addition of homogenates of isolated, pooled sebaceous glands to the incubation medium. Indirect evidence suggests that the fatty acids from sebaceous triglycerides are utilized for cholesterol esterification by the bacteria. These results indicate that the proportion of steryl esters in skin surface lipids may be influenced by the density of the microbial population in the skin.
TI  - Analysis of lipid composition of isolated human sebaceous gland homogenates after incubation with cutaneous bacteria. Thin-layer chromatography.
AB  - The effects of specific species of skin bacteria on human sebaceous gland lipids  in vitro were analyzed. Isolated dissected sebaceous glands were pooled, homogenized, and sterilized, then incorporated into peptone-yeast extract medium and used as substrate for growth of Propionibacterium acnes, P. granulosum, and Staphylococcus epidermidis subgroup II. The sebaceous lipids were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography before and after bacterial growth. The most striking effect of bacteria on sebaceous gland lipid composition was the hydrolysis of sebaceous triglycerides. The degree of hydrolysis varied with bacterial strain but was most complete with P. acnes and P. granulosum. Staphylococci were not effective in hydrolyzing sebaceous triglycerides at pH 4.5 although, when the pH of the medium was raised to pH 6.4, some strains of staphylococci were as effective as the propionibacteria in hydrolyzing sebaceous triglycerides to free fatty acids. Thus minor changes in acidity may play asignificant role in controlling the lipolytic activity of staphylococci on skin. Another effect of bacterial action on sebaceous gland lipids was the esterification of sebaceous cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. Thus, bacterial action must be taken into account in evaluating studies of alterations in cutaneous cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in skin surface lipids in normal and disease states.
TI  - Characteristics of the extracellular lipases from Corynebacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  - Levels of antibody to Staphylococcus epidermidis in patients with acne vulgaris.
AB  - Sera from 23 patients with acne vulgaris of varying degrees and sera from 15 patients with skin diseases other than acne were tested for antibody levels to Staphylococcus epidermidis by use of bacterial agglutination and agar-gel immunodiffusion. Antibody levels to S epidermidis varied from 0 to 1:160 in both the patients with acne and in the control groups. There was no correlation between the antibody level to S epidermidis and the degree of acne. In a previous investigation it was found that antibody levels to Corynebacterium acnes are significantly increased in serum from patients with papulopustular and cystic acne. Both S epidermidis and C acnes can frequently be isolated from lesions in acne. The fact that antibody levels are increased to C acnes but not to S epidermidis may indicate that the mere presence of an organism in the acne lesion is not sufficient stimulation for antibody formation. The increase of antibody to C acnes which was demonstrated previously in patients with severe acne vulgaris may therefore reflect a direct involvement of the organism in the acne process.
