TI  == use of prevotella bryantii 25a and a commercial probiotic during subacute acidosis challenge in midlactation dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of prevotella bryantii  25a as a probiotic during a subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) challenge using a commercial probiotic as a positive control. six multiparous ruminally fistulated  cows (bw=685 +/- 65 kg; (mean +/- sd) in the mid-phase of lactation (70 to 148 dim) received the following treatments in a replicated 3x3 latin square design: (1) total mixed ration (tmr; control, con), (2) tmr + 2g/head per day of a probiotic combination of enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae (efsc), or (3) tmr + prevotella bryantii 25a. the latin square consisted of 3 wk  of adaptation to the respective treatments during which the animals were fed ad libitum once per day a conventional early-lactation tmr and 1.5 kg of hay. the adaptation was followed by 4 d of sara (no hay) and 10d of rest (adaptation diet  without probiotics). dry matter intake and milk production were depressed during  sara (22.0 and 31.8 kg/d, respectively) compared with adaptation (24.4 and 34.0 kg/d, respectively) and did not recover during rest (22.3 and 30.7 kg/d, respectively). during sara, p. bryantii 25a had no effect on rumen ph, whereas efsc reduced the percentage of time with ph <6.0 (71%) compared with con (85%) and increased maximum ph. the efsc treatment tended to increase mean ph over 24h  (5.65) compared with con (5.45). proportion of time with ph <5.6 tended to be lower with efsc (46%) than with con (62%). populations of bacteria considered to  be the most important cellulose digesters in the rumen (ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminococcus albus, and fibrobacter succinogenes) were also monitored during these treatments using culture-independent real-time pcr methods. the population of r. flavefaciens was similar between the 2 feeding phases, whereas f. succinogenes and r. albus were lower during sara compared with rest. in light of the present study, p. bryantii 25a did not prove to be an effective preventative for sara. the role of efsc in regulating rumen ph was confirmed, with a possible effect of maintaining r. flavefaciens populations during sara.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
