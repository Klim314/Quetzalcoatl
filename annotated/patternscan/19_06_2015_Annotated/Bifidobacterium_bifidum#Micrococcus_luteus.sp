TI  == bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.
AB  == we previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the platelia aspergillus (pa) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (m. a. s. h. mennink-kersten, r. r. klont, a. warris, h. j. m. op den camp, and p. e. verweij, lancet 363:325-327, 2004). we tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the pa elisa, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and tested for pa elisa reactivity. all bifidobacteria, except b. infantis and b. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., micrococcus luteus and propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. elisa reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. all neonatal feces showed pa elisa reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum pa elisa reactivity in selected patient groups,  especially neonates.

TI  == influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
AB  == the effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the  unanesthetized state. intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (ria), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. clostridium tabificum vp  04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (mmc) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to  21.2 +/- 0.14 min (p < 0.01). lactobacillus acidophilus a10 and bifidobacterium bifidum b11 reduced the mmc period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (p < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (p < 0.05). micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an mmc period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (p < 0.01). inhibition was indicated also for  escherichia coli x7 gnotobiotic rats. no consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. the concentration of neuropeptide y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the mmc depending on the species involved. bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.
