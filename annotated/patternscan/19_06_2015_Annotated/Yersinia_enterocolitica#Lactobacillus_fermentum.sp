TI  == lactobacillus fermentum attenuates the proinflammatory effect of yersinia enterocolitica on human epithelial cells.
AB  == background: lactobacilli represent a major component of the human microbiota. in  this study we investigated whether and how lactobacillus fermentum inhibits the proinflammatory responses of human epithelial cells on yersinia enterocolitica infection. methods: human epithelial cells were exposed to y. enterocolitica pyv(-) or l. fermentum or to both strains, combinations of heat-killed l. fermentum or supernatant of l. fermentum cultures and y. enterocolitica. the modulation of y. enterocolitica induced il-8 levels in the culture supernatants was determined and activation of rac, p38, and nf-kappab was investigated. results: exposure of human epithelial cells to l. fermentum does not induce nf-kappab activation and subsequent il-8 secretion in hela cells, whereas y. enterocolitica induces nf-kappab activation and high levels of il-8. viable l. fermentum, supernatant of l. fermentum cultures, but not heat-killed l. fermentum, inhibited il-8 secretion of hela cells triggered by y. enterocolitica. lactobacillus fermentum-exposed hela cells showed decreased rac, p38, and nf-kappab activation after y. enterocolitica infection. treatment of l. fermentum supernatants with phospholipase c abolished the inhibitory effect, indicating that a secreted phospholipid mediates the antiinflammatory properties of l. fermentum. adhesion to or invasion of y. enterocolitica into epithelial cells was not altered by coincubation with l. fermentum. conclusion: our results lead to the conclusion that l. fermentum inhibits the y. enterocolitica-induced il-8 production by a possibly secreted phospholipid of <10 kda molecular weight. these data suggest that l. fermentum may have probiotic properties modulating intestinal inflammatory responses and might offer new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory diseases.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.
