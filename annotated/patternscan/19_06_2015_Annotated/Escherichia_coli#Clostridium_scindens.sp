TI  == identification and characterization of two bile acid coenzyme a transferases from clostridium scindens, a bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium.
AB  == the human bile acid pool composition is composed of both primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid). secondary bile acids are formed by the 7alpha-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by intestinal anaerobic  bacteria. we have previously described a multistep biochemical pathway in clostridium scindens that is responsible for bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation. we have identified a large (12 kb) bile acid inducible (bai) operon in this bacterium that encodes eight genes involved in bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation.  however, the function of the baif gene product in this operon has not been elucidated. in the current study, we cloned and expressed the baif gene in e. coli and discovered it has bile acid coa transferase activity. in addition, we discovered a second bai operon encoding three genes. the baik gene in this operon was expressed in e. coli and found to encode a second bile acid coa transferase.  both bile acid coa transferases were determined to be members of the type iii family by amino acid sequence comparisons. both bile acid coa transferases had broad substrate specificity, except the baik gene product, which failed to use lithocholyl-coa as a coa donor. primary bile acids are ligated to coa via an atp-dependent mechanism during the initial steps of 7alpha-dehydroxylation. the bile acid coa transferases conserve the thioester bond energy, saving the cell atp molecules during bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation. atp-dependent coa ligation is likely quickly supplanted by atp-independent coa transfer.

TI  == clostridium scindens baicd and baih genes encode stereo-specific 7alpha/7beta-hydroxy-3-oxo-delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductases.
AB  == secondary bile acids, formed by intestinal bacteria, are suggested to play a significant role in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. bile acid 7alpha/beta-dehydroxylation is carried out by a few species of intestinal clostridia which harbor a multi-gene bile acid inducible (bai) operon. several genes encoding enzymes in this pathway have been cloned and characterized. however, no gene product(s) has yet been assigned to the production of 3-oxo-delta4-cholenoic acid intermediates of cholic acid (ca), chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca) or ursodeoxycholic acid (udca). we previously reported that the baih  gene encodes an nadh:flavin oxidoreductase (nadh:for); however, the role of this  protein in bile acid 7-dehydroxylation is unclear. homology searches and secondary structural alignments suggest this protein to be similar to flavoproteins which reduce alpha/beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. the baih gene product was expressed in escherichia coli, purified and discovered to be a stereo-specific nad(h)-dependent 7beta-hydroxy-3-oxo-delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase. additionally, high sequence similarity between the baih and baicd gene products suggests the baicd gene may encode a 3-oxo-delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase specific for cdca and ca. we tested this hypothesis using cell extracts prepared from e. coli overexpressing the baicd gene and discovered that  it encodes a stereo-specific nad(h)-dependent 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-delta4-cholenoic acid oxidoreductase.

TI  == sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708.
AB  == eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 expresses inducible bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity via a multistep pathway. the genes encoding several of the inducible proteins involved in the pathway have been previously mapped to a bile acid-inducible (bai) operon in eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. we now report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the baig gene, which is part of the bai operon. the predicted amino acid sequence of the baig polypeptide shows significant homology to several membrane transport proteins, including sugar and antibiotic resistance transporters, which are members of the  major facilitator superfamily. hydrophilicity plots of baig show a high degree of similarity to class k and l teta proteins from gram-positive bacteria, and, like  these classes of teta proteins, baig has 14 proposed transmembrane domains. the baig gene was cloned into escherichia coli and shown to confer an energy-dependent bile acid uptake activity. primary bile acids were preferentially transported into e. coli cells expressing this gene, with at least sevenfold and fourfold increases in the uptake of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively, over control reactions. less transport activity was observed with cholylglycine, 7-oxocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid. the transport activity was inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and nigericin but not by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that the transport is driven by the proton motive force across the cell membrane. in summary, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a bile acid-inducible bile acid transporter from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a gene encoding a procaryotic bile acid transporter.

TI  == expression and characterization of a c24 bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase from eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 in escherichia coli.
AB  == the intestinal bacterium eubacterium sp. strain vpi 12708 has been shown to have  a bile acid 7 alpha/7 beta-dehydroxylation pathway. a large bile acid inducible (bai) operon encoding at least 9 open reading frames has been cloned and sequenced from this bacterium. the baie gene from this operon has been subcloned  and expressed in e. coli and found to encode a bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase (ba7 alpha d). the purified ba7 alpha d was shown to have a calculated subunit mass of 19 kd and a relative native molecular weight of 36,000. the km and vmax for 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid was 0.16 mm and 0.48 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. of the substrates tested, the ba7 alpha d used only 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid as substrates. a molecular modeling program  (sybyl) was used to calculate the energy differences between the various intermediates in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway. a marked energy difference  (-9.4 kcal/mol) was observed between 7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acid and 12 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4,6-choldienoic acid, possibly accounting for the apparent irreversibility of the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase reaction under our experimental conditions. no significant amino acid sequence homologies were found between ba7 alpha d and other proteins  in the data base; however, ba7 alpha d does contain a lipocalin signature sequence, possibly indicating a bile acid binding domain. the bile acid 7 alpha-dehydratase appears to be a unique enzyme in the bacterial bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway.

TI  == bacterial metabolism of natural and synthetic sex hormones undergoing enterohepatic circulation.
AB  == steroids undergoing enterohepatic circulation are exposed to bacterial metabolism particularly by obligate anaerobes which account for 99.99% of the fecal flora. the most common transformation is hydrolysis of conjugated steroids. the glucuronidases are synthesized by escherichia coli and bacteroides species. the bacterial catabolism of unconjugated steroids may be considered under several headings: 1. reduction of ring-a due to clostridia species synthesizing specific  enzymes; c. paraputrificum, 3 alpha,5 beta-reductase; c. innocuum, 3 beta,5 beta-reductase; and a new species c.j-1, 3 beta,5 alpha-reductase. 2. reduction of the delta 5 bond by human fecal flora. the specific strain(s) synthesizing the enzyme have not yet been identified. 3. reduction of 17-keto estrogens by the above mentioned ring-a reducing clostridia and by eubacterium lentum. 4. reduction of 17-keto androstenes by bacteroides fragilis. 5. desmolase mediated side chain cleavage at c17-c20 position of 17 alpha-hydroxysteroids by two new species clostridium scindens and eubacterium desmolans isolated from human and cat fecal flora respectively and by clostridium cadavaris isolated from new york  city sewage. 6. and 16 alpha- and 21-dehydroxylase by e. lentum a normal inhabitant of the human gut; it is the only organism known to synthesize 16 alpha- or 21-dehydroxylases. due to the high specificity of the enzymes and the simplicity of extracting the metabolites, biosynthesis of reference compounds and radioimmunoassay reagents is practical and inexpensive. the enzymes can also be used for titration of specific bacterial strains in fecal flora and as markers for bacterial identification in particular for the strains difficult to be defined by regular biochemical reactions.
