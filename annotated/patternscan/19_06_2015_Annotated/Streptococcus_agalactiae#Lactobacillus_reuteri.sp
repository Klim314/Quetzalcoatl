TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == peptide surface display and secretion using two lpxtg-containing surface proteins from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == a locus encoding two repetitive proteins that have lpxtg cell wall anchoring signals from lactobacillus fermentum br11 has been identified by using an antiserum raised against whole l. fermentum br11 cells. the first protein, rlp, is similar to the rib surface protein from streptococcus agalactiae, while the other protein, mlp, is similar to the mucus binding protein mub from lactobacillus reuteri. it was shown that multiple copies of mlp exist in the genome of l. fermentum br11. regions of rlp, mlp, and the previously characterized surface protein bspa were used to surface display or secrete heterologous peptides in l. fermentum. the peptides tested were 10 amino acids of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein and a six-histidine epitope (his(6)). the bspa promoter and secretion signal were used in combination with the rlp cell wall sorting signal to express, export, and covalently anchor the heterologous peptides to the cell wall. detection of the cell surface protein fusions revealed that rlp was a significantly better surface display vector than  bspa despite having lower cellular levels (0.7 mg per liter for the rlp fusion compared with 4 mg per liter for the bspa fusion). the mlp promoter and encoded secretion signal were used to express and export large (328-kda at 10 mg per liter) and small (27-kda at 0.06 mg per liter) amino-terminal fragments of the mlp protein fused to the his(6) and cftr peptides or his(6) peptide, respectively. therefore, these newly described proteins from l. fermentum br11 have potential as protein production and targeting vectors.

TI  == identification and cloning of a plasmid-encoded erythromycin resistance determinant from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == plasmid analysis, plasmid curing, cloning, and hybridization experiments were used to study four lactobacillus reuteri strains showing high resistance to erythromycin. plasmid curing with acriflavine resulted in a loss of erythromycin  resistance in a frequency of 1-10%. for three of the strains this was accompanied by a loss of a 6.9-mda plasmid, which was shown to be identical for the different strains and designated plul631. the erythromycin (erm) gene was located on a 5.5-mda plasmid in the fourth strain. a restriction map of plul631 was constructed and the location of the erm gene on the plasmid was identified by cloning in escherichia coli. by using a streptococcus lactis-e. coli shuttle vector, the erm gene was also transformed to s. lactis and expressed. the erm gene from l. reuteri was shown to be related to the erm gene from pip501 (streptococcus agalactiae) by dna-dna hybridization.
