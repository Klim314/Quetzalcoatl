TI  - Bacterial cell surface properties: role of loosely bound extracellular polymeric  substances (LB-EPS).
AB  - This study investigated the effect of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) on the comprehensive surface properties of four bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida). The removal of LB-EPS from bacterial surfaces by high-speed centrifugation (12,000xg) was confirmed by SEM images. Viability tests showed that the percentages of viable cells ranged from 95.9% to 98.0%, and no significant difference was found after treatment (P>0.05). FTIR spectra revealed the presence of phosphodiester, carboxylic, phosphate, and amino functional groups on bacteria surfaces, and the removal of LB-EPS did not alter the types of cell surface functional groups. Potentiometric titration results suggested the total site concentrations on the intact bacteria were higher than those on LB-EPS free bacteria. Most of the acidity constants (pKa) were almost identical, except the increased pKa values of phosphodiester groups on LB-EPS free S. suis and E. coli surfaces. The electrophoretic mobilities and hydrodynamic diameters of the intact and LB-EPS free bacteria were statistically unchanged (P>0.05), indicating LB-EPS had no influence on the net surface charges and size distribution of bacteria. However, LB-ESP could enhance cell aggregation processes. The four LB-EPS free bacteria all exhibited fewer hydrophobicity values (26.1-65.0%) as compared to the intact cells (47.4-69.3%), suggesting the removal of uncharged nonpolar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates) in LB-EPS. These findings improve our understanding of the changes in cell surface characterizations induced by LB-EPS, and have important implications for assessing the role of LB-EPS in bacterial adhesion and transport behaviors.
TI  - Potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  - A new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O8, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, Streptococcus suis, Listeria monocytogenes and Pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. In adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of B. subtilis JT143 and L. acidophilus LY24 respectively isolated from BioPlus((R))2B and FloraFIT((R)) Probiotics (P < 0.05). The adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. The survival rate of B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. The strain was fully resistant to pH 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. Additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. The safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. These results implied that that the new strain of B. coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).
AB  - Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. On the basis of the cDNA library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named AS566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from M. domestica larva stimulated with Salmonella pullorum (Enterobacteriaceae: Salmonella). In this study, the full-length AS566 gene was cloned and inserted into a His-tagged Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia) prokaryotic expression system to enable production of the recombinant protein. The recombinant AS566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active AS566 protein. The bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified AS566 protein was assessed using the Oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that AS566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an E. coli clinical isolate, S. pullorum, Streptococcus bovis (Streptococcaceae: Streptococcus), Streptococcus suis, and Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcaceae: Staphylococcus) in vitro. The antibacterial activity of AS566 toward Gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against Gram+ bacteria. The sequencing results and BLAST analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene AS566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in GenBank. The antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered AS566 protein warrant further study.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. This can compromise treatment of human infections. In the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in Escherichia coli and salmonella. While these are still important the focus has shifted to ESBL producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. In addition Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) suddenly emerged in 2007. We also need to consider multi-resistant strains of Streptococcus suis. Environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - [Expression, purification and hIgG-binding activity identification of truncated Streptococcus suis factor H-binding protein].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a prokaryotic expression vector of the His-tagged truncated factor H-binding protein (Fhb) fragments, Fhb-N (amino acids 45-344aa) and Fhb-C (amino acids 345-644aa), of Streptococcus suis serotype 2, express it in E.coli BL21 (DE3) in order to acquire high-purity recombinant protein, and finally identify the binding activity with human serum IgG (hIgG). METHODS: Fhb-N gene and Fhb-C gene were amplified using the primers designed according to 05ZYH33 genome sequences and cloned into the expression vector pET28a(+) to construct recombinant plasmids. The plasmids were transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) and induced to express by IPTG. The recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and identified by Western blotting. The hIgG was purified from human serum by HiTrap protein G HP column in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, the specific binding to hIgG was identified by Western blotting and biolayer Interferometry (BLI). RESULTS: The prokaryotic expression vector of His-Fhb-N and His-Fhb-C was constructed, and the target proteins were expressed, purified and identified. The specific binding activity with hIgG was identified and the binding region was found located on the Fhb-N(45-344aa). CONCLUSION: His-Fhb-N can specifically bind to hIgG, which will help us to further study the role of Fhb-hIgG interaction in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data on Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida,  and Streptococcus suis isolates from Ontario swine (January 1998 to October 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in Ontario, Canada. In relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. Limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. Changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. Data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. These changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.
TI  - A functional peptidoglycan hydrolase characterized from T4SS in 89K pathogenicity island of epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) has evolved efficient mechanisms to cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which is a new emerging infectious disease linked to S. suis. We have previously reported that a type IV secretion system (T4SS) harbored by the specific 89K pathogenicity island (PAI) of S. suis 2 contributes to the development of STSS and mediates horizontal transfer of 89K. However, the 89K T4SS machinery assembly in vivo and in vitro is poorly understood, and the component acting directly to digest the bacterial cell wall needs to be identified. RESULTS: The virB1-89K gene product encoded in the 89K PAI is the only one that shows similarity to the Agrobacterium VirB1 component and contains a conserved CHAP domain that may function in peptidoglycan hydrolysis, which makes it a plausible candidate acting as a hydrolase against the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow the assembly of the T4SS apparatus. In the current study, the CHAP domain of VirB1-89K from S. suis 89K PAI was cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and its peptidoglycan-degrading activity in vitro was determined. The results indicated that the VirB1-89K CHAP domain can degrade the peptidoglycan layer of bacteria. Deletion of virB1-89K reduces significantly, but does not abolish, the virulence of S. suis in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results presented here suggested that VirB1-89K facilitates the assembly of 89K T4SS apparatus by catalyzing the degradation of the peptidoglycan cell wall, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of S. suis 2 infection.
TI  - Adhesion of bacterial pathogens to soil colloidal particles: influences of cell type, natural organic matter, and solution chemistry.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen  interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles (<2 mum) in soil has not been investigated. This study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (NOM), and solution chemistry. Specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using NOM-present, NOM-stripped soil colloids, Streptococcus suis SC05 and Escherichia coli WH09 over a wide range of solution pH (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (IS, 1-100 mM KCl). Cell characterization techniques, Freundlich isotherm, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. The adhesion coefficients (Kf) of S. suis SC05 to NOM-present and NOM-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than E. coli WH09, respectively. Similarly, Kf values of S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 adhesion to NOM-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with NOM-present, respectively, suggesting NOM inhibits bacterial adhesion. Cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing pH and enhanced with rising IS (1-50 mM). Interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by DLVO-type forces, with S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. S. suis SC05 adhesion decreased at higher IS 100 mM, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on S. suis SC05 surface as compared to E. coli WH09. Hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of DLVO, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry.
TI  - Multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis isolates from Ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 Porcine Circovirus type-2 Associated Disease outbreak.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli F4, Pasteurella multocida and Streptococcus suis from Ontario swine 1998-2010. Temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the E. coli and P. multocida data. Although not present in the E. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within P. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of Porcine Circovirus Associated Disease (PCVAD) before it was confirmed. Prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the PCVAD outbreak in the fall of 2004.
TI  - Restoration of bioactive lantibiotic suicin from a remnant lan locus of pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. Their biosynthesis genes are usually organized in gene clusters, which are mainly found in Gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic streptococci. Three highly virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains (98HAH33, 05ZYH33, and SC84) have been shown to contain an 89K pathogenicity island. Here, on these islands, we unveiled and reannotated a putative lantibiotic locus designated sui which contains a virulence-associated two-component regulator, suiK-suiR. In silico analysis revealed that the putative lantibiotic modification gene suiM was interrupted by a 7.9-kb integron and that other biosynthesis-related genes contained various frameshift mutations. By reconstituting the intact suiM in Escherichia coli together with a semi-in vitro biosynthesis system, a putative lantibiotic named suicin was produced with bactericidal activities against a variety of Gram-positive strains, including pathogenic streptococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ring topology dissection indicated that the 34-amino-acid lantibiotic contained two methyllanthionine residues and one disulfide bridge, which render suicin in an N-terminal linear and C-terminal globular shape. To confirm the function of suiK-suiR, SuiR was overexpressed and purified. In vitro analysis showed that SuiR could specifically bind to the suiA gene promoter. Its coexpression with suiK could activate suiA gene promoter in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Conclusively, we obtained a novel lantibiotic suicin by restoring its production from the remnant sui locus and demonstrated that virulence-associated SuiK-SuiR regulates its production.
TI  - Development of a LAMP assay for rapid detection of different intimin variants of  attaching and effacing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Intimin harboured by pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains is a key virulence factor involved in host cell adherence and colonization. Twenty-seven intimin-encoding E. coli attaching and effacing (eae) gene variants have been reported according to their 3' binding domain sequences. In our study, we developed a specific and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect all known intimin variants. Four primers specific for six regions of eae genes were designed using online software. The eae-LAMP assay was highly specific and detected all 27 tested eae variants; no cross-reactions were observed with genes from enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), E. coli BL21, Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria monocytogenes, or Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2). With the lowest detection limit of approximately 10 copies per reaction the eae-LAMP assay was 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR. These results, and the results of tests involving food and faecal samples artificially contaminated with E. coli O157 : H7 (eaegamma+), show that the eae-LAMP assay is a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific tool for detecting intimin variants from pathogenic strains of E. coli. The eae-LAMP assay has great potential for wider applications, not only in the laboratory but also in the field setting, as it does not require specialized equipment.
TI  - Identification of in-vivo induced genes of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 specially expressed in infected human.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) serotype 2 usually cause infection in swine. Recently, two large-scale outbreaks in China with severe streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and high mortality raised worldwide concern to human S. suis infection. To reveal the molecular pathogenesis of S. suis 2 during human infection, in-vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) was applied to identify the in-vivo induced genes (ivi genes) of S. suis 05ZYH33. The ivi genes are specifically expressed or up-regulated in-vivo and always associated with the in-vivo survival and pathogenicity of pathogens. In present study, convalescent sera from S. suis 05ZYH33 infected patients were pooled and fully adsorbed with in-vitro grown S. suis 05ZYH33 and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Genomic expression library of 05ZYH33 was repeatedly screened with colony immunoblot assay using adsorbed sera. Finally, 19 genes were assessed as ivi genes of 05ZYH33. Fifteen of 19 genes encode proteins with biological functions in substance transport and metabolism, cell structure biogenesis, cell cycle control, replication, translation and other functions. The 4 remaining genes encode proteins with unknown functions. Of the 19 ivi genes, five (SSU05_0247, 0437, 1577, 1664 and 2144) encode proteins with no immunoreactivity to control sera from healthy individuals never exposed to 05ZYH33. The successful identification of ivi genes not only sheds light on understanding the pathogenesis of S. suis 05ZYH33 during its human infection, but also provides potential targets for the developments of new vaccines, therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents against human S. suis infection.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Hyaluronate lyase is an important surface enzyme of many streptococcal species. The enzyme degrades several biologically important connective tissue components, which facilitates the spreading of the bacteria throughout the host tissues and presumably provides energy and a carbon source for bacterial cells. Recombinant hyaluronate lyase was expressed in Escherichia coli and was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belonged to space group P222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 58.08, b = 101.32, c = 103.47 A and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.50 A resolution.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a new cell surface protein possessing factor H-binding activity in the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. The  ability of pathogenic bacteria to bind the complement regulator factor H on their cell surface may allow them to avoid complement attack and phagocytosis. The aim of this study was to characterize a new cell surface protein possessing factor H-binding activity in S. suis serotype 2. The capacity of S. suis to bind the complement regulator factor H on its surface was demonstrated by ELISA. Using a factor I-cofactor assay, it was found that the functional activity of factor H bound to S. suis was kept. Since the product of gene SSU0186 in S. suis P1/7 shared similarity with a Streptococcus pneumoniae protein (named PspC) possessing factor H-binding activity, it was proposed as a putative factor H receptor in S. suis. SSU0186 has a 1686 bp open reading frame encoding a 561 amino acid protein containing the Gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (LPXTG) at the carboxy-terminal, an amino-terminal signal sequence, an alpha-helix domain, a proline-rich region and a G5 domain. The SSU0186 gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant factor H-binding protein showed a molecular mass of 95 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein possessed the functional property of binding factor H. Sera from S. suis-infected pigs reacted with the recombinant factor H receptor, suggesting that it is produced during the course of infections. In conclusion, we identified a novel S. suis cell surface protein that binds the complement factor H. This cell surface protein may help S. suis to resist complement attack and phagocytosis and contribute to pathogenesis.
TI  - Zinc as an agent for the prevention of biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: Biofilm formation is important for the persistence of bacteria in hostile environments. Bacteria in a biofilm are usually more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants than planktonic bacteria. Our laboratory previously reported that low concentrations of zinc inhibit biofilm formation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zinc on growth and biofilm formation of other bacterial swine pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effect of zinc on biofilm formation, biofilms were grown with or without zinc in 96-well plates and stained with crystal violet. At micromolar concentrations (0-250 mu mol l(-1)), zinc weakly inhibited bacterial growth and it effectively blocked biofilm formation by A. pleuropneumoniae, Salmonella Typhymurium and Haemophilus parasuis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, biofilm formation of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis was slightly inhibited by zinc. However, zinc did not disperse preformed biofilms. To determine whether zinc inhibits biofilm formation when poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PGA) is present, PGA was detected with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Only A. pleuropneumoniae and Staph. aureus biofilms were found to contain PGA. CONCLUSION: Zinc used at nonbactericidal concentrations can inhibit biofilm formation by several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial swine pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The antibiofilm activity of zinc could provide a tool to fight biofilms, and the nonspecific inhibitory effect may well extend to other important human and animal bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Bacteraemias in tropical Australia: changing trends over a 10-year period.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This is the largest reported study of bacteraemias in Australia. The presence of organisms endemic to the tropical region and the changing trends described have significant implications for empirical antibiotic therapy. This retrospective study examined 8976 blood cultures from Townsville Hospital, a regional Australian hospital located in the tropics over a 10-year period. The rate of bacteraemic episodes during the study period was 10.12 per 1000 admissions. Intravenous devices (18.7%), immunosuppressive therapy (16.1%), and urinary tract infections (16.1%) were important sources for bacteraemia. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (20.9%) and Escherichia. coli (15.6%). A significant reduction was observed in S. aureus susceptibility to clindamycin (P < 0.05) and in E. coli susceptibility to gentamicin. Organisms isolated that were of relevance to the tropics of Australia included Burkholderia pseudomallei, Group A streptococcus, and Brucella suis.
TI  - A novel fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 contributes  to epithelial cell invasion and in vivo dissemination.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important pathogen with zoonotic potential. In this study, a novel in vivo induced protein Ssa, encoded by the functionally unknown gene SSU05_1311, was identified as a surface anchored fibronectin-binding protein. The recombinant Ssa as well as its truncated proteins harboring the N-terminal domain (residues 33-153) could bind to human fibronectin with high-affinity. Isogenic knockout of ssa in SS2 led to decrease of bacterial binding to immobilized fibronectin. SS2 Deltassa mutant showed reduced adherence and invasion of human pharyngeal epithelial (HEp-2) cells compared to the wild type strain. Heterologous surface display of Ssa fibronectin-binding domain in Escherichia coli enhanced the bacterial attachment and entry to HEp-2 cells. Less SS2 Deltassa mutants than the wild type strain were recovered from the blood and brains of the Balb/c mice infected intranasally. But there was no significant difference between the wild type and the mutant on phagocytosis by macrophages (RAW264.7) and bacterial killing by murine PMNs under opsonizing condition. Our data suggest that Ssa is an important virulence factor for SS2 crossing the mucosal epithelia to disseminate in vivo.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) still results in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. A residual disease burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus suis. Here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter these pathogens. We discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.
TI  - Combined antibacterial activity of phage lytic proteins holin and lysin from Streptococcus suis bacteriophage SMP.
AB  - Development of novel antibacterial agents is required to control infection with multidrug-resistant Streptococcus suis. HolSMP and LySMP, the holin and lysin of S. suis serotype 2 bacteriophage, named SMP, are responsible for lysis of host cells and release of progeny phage. HolSMP and LySMP expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) exerted efficient activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2, with addition of 0.8 % beta-mercaptoethanol. Lytic spectra of purified HolSMP, LySMP or HolSMP + LySMP mixture were investigated. HolSMP, exhibiting a narrow lytic spectrum, was effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, which were insensitive to LySMP. Moreover, HolSMP was identified as a promising antibacterial agent which was able to extend the spectrum of LySMP. The data suggest that combined use of holin and lysin could be a candidate strategy for resolution of drug resistance.
TI  - Sialylation of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is essential for capsule expression  but is not responsible for the main capsular epitope.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide is a critical virulence factor of the swine and zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2. The capsule of this bacterium is composed of five different sugars, including terminal sialic acid. To evaluate the role of sialic acid in the pathogenesis of the infection, the neuC gene, encoding for an enzyme essential for sialic acid biosynthesis, was inactivated in a highly virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain. Using transmission electron microscopy, it was shown that inactivation of neuC resulted in loss of expression of the whole capsule. Compared to the parent strain, the DeltaneuC mutant strain was more phagocytosed by macrophages and was also severely impaired in virulence in a mouse infection model. Both native and desialylated S. suis serotype 2 purified capsular polysaccharides were recognized by a polyclonal anti-whole cell S. suis serotype 2 serum and a monospecific polyclonal anti-capsule serotype 2 serum. In contrast, only the native capsular polysaccharide was recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for the sialic acid moiety of the serotype 2 capsule. Together, our results infer that sialylation of S. suis serotype 2 may be essential for capsule expression, but that this sugar is not the main epitope of this serotype.
TI  - Characterization and determination of holin protein of Streptococcus suis bacteriophage SMP in heterologous host.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Holins are a group of phage-encoded membrane proteins that control access of phage-encoded endolysins to the peptidoglycan, and thereby trigger the lysis process at a precise time point as the 'lysis clock'. SMP is an isolated and characterized Streptococcus suis lytic phage. The aims of this study were to determine the holin gene, HolSMP, in the genome of SMP, and characterized the function of holin, HolSMP, in phage infection. RESULTS: HolSMP was predicted to encode a small membrane protein with three hydrophobic transmembrane helices. During SMP infections, HolSMP was transcribed as a late gene and HolSMP accumulated harmlessly in the cell membrane before host cell lysis. Expression of HolSMP in Escherichia coli induced an increase in cytoplasmic membrane permeability, an inhibition of host cell growth and significant cell lysis in the presence of LySMP, the endolysin of phage SMP. HolSMP was prematurely triggered by the addition of energy poison to the medium. HolSMP complemented the defective lambda S allele in a non-suppressing Escherichia coli strain to produce phage plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HolSMP is the holin protein of phage SMP and a two-step lysis system exists in SMP.
TI  - [Expression, purification and protective antigen analysis of cell wall protein MRP of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - AIM: To amplify the mrp gene of Streptococcus suis type 2 05ZYH33, express it in  E.coli BL21 in order to acquire high purity recombinant protein MRP, then evaluate the protective antigen of recombinant protein MRP. METHODS: Using PCR technology to obtain the product of mrp gene of 05ZYH33, and then cloned it into the expression vector pET28a(+). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography, later immunized New Zealand rabbit to gain anti-serum, then test the anti-serum titer by ELISA. The opsonophagocytic killing test demonstrated the abilities of protective antigen of MRP. RESULTS: The truncated of MRP recombinant protein in E.coli BL21 expressed by inclusion bodies, and purified it in high purity. After immunoprotection, the survival condition of CD-1 was significantly elevated. The survival rate of wild-type strain 05ZYH33 in blood was apparently decreased after anti-serum opsonophagocyticed, but the mutant delta; MRP showed no differences. CONCLUSION: MRP represent an important protective antigen activity.
TI  - Characterization and functional analysis of atl, a novel gene encoding autolysin  in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicemia and meningitis. A novel gene, designated atl and encoding a major autolysin of S. suis 2 virulent strain HA9801, was identified and characterized in this study. The Atl protein contains 1,025 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 113 kDa and has a conserved N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain. Recombinant Atl was expressed in Escherichia coli, and its bacteriolytic and fibronectin-binding activities were confirmed by zymography and Western affinity blotting. Two bacteriolytic bands were shown in the sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of HA9801, while both were absent from the atl inactivated mutant. Cell chains of the mutant strain became longer than that of the parental strain. In the autolysis assay, HA9801 decreased to 20% of the initial optical density (OD) value, while the mutant strain had almost no autolytic activity. The biofilm capacity of the atl mutant was reduced approximately 30% compared to the parental strain. In the zebrafish infection model, the 50% lethal dose of the mutant strain was increased up to 5-fold. Furthermore, the adherence to HEp-2 cells of the atl mutant was 50% less than that of the parental strain. Based on the functional analysis of the recombinant Atl and observed effects of atl inactivation on HA9801, we conclude that Atl is a major autolysin of HA9801. It takes part in cell autolysis, separation of daughter cells, biofilm formation, fibronectin-binding activity, cell adhesion, and pathogenesis of HA9801.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Microbial ecology of swine farms and PRRS vaccine vaccination strategies.
AB  - The present study investigated the microbial ecology and vaccination strategies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in field condition. Four representative farms with a history of PRRS were included in this study. Over the almost 3-year period, the average detection rate was 68.9%, making PRRSV the first most frequently detected virus, followed by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (64.2%), pseudorabies virus (PRV) (11.03%) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) (4.41%). Streptococcus suis (77.92%), Haemophilus parasuis (51.25%) and Escherichia coli (52.39%), Pasteurella multocida (26.77%) were isolated most frequently in association with PRRSV. Under the present microbial ecology, production performances of sows their offspring after mass vaccination with a PRRS attenuated vaccine were evaluated. In addition, large scale PRRS vaccines usage and efficacy were further performed. The results indicated that mass vaccination following our immunization program can improve health status and production performances of both sows (2ml/i.m. booster after 4 weeks, and then immunized quarterly) and their offsprings (1ml/i.m. on 14-18 days of age).
TI  - Fluoroquinolone efflux in Streptococcus suis is mediated by SatAB and not by SmrA.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. With the lack of an effective vaccine, antibiotics remain the main tool to fight infections caused by this pathogen. We have previously observed a reserpine-sensitive fluoroquinolone (FQ) efflux phenotype in this species. Here, SatAB and SmrA, two pumps belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), respectively, have been analyzed in the fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolate BB1013. Genes encoding these pumps were overexpressed either constitutively or in the presence of ciprofloxacin in this strain. These genes could not be cloned in plasmids in Escherichia coli despite strong expression repression. Finally, site-directed insertion of smrA and satAB in the amy locus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome using ligated PCR amplicons allowed for the functional expression and study of both pumps. Results showed that SatAB is a narrow-spectrum fluoroquinolone exporter (norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin), susceptible to reserpine, whereas SmrA was not involved in fluoroquinolone resistance. Chromosomal integration in Bacillus is a novel method for studying efflux pumps from Gram-positive bacteria, which enabled us to demonstrate the possible role of SatAB, and not SmrA, in fluoroquinolone efflux in S. suis.
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal adhesin P (SadP) protein recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose-containing glycoconjugates: convergent evolution of bacterial pathogens to binding of the same host receptor.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion is often a prerequisite for infection, and host cell surface carbohydrates play a major role as adhesion receptors. Streptococci are a leading cause of infectious diseases. However, only few carbohydrate-specific streptococcal adhesins are known. Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen and a zoonotic agent causing meningitis in pigs and humans. In this study, we have identified an adhesin that mediates the binding of S. suis to galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose (Galalpha1-4Gal)-containing host receptors. A functionally unknown S. suis cell wall protein (SSU0253), designated here as SadP (streptococcal adhesin P), was identified using a Galalpha1-4Gal-containing affinity matrix and LC-ESI mass spectrometry. Although the function of the protein was not previously known, it was recently identified as an immunogenic cell wall protein in a proteomic study. Insertional inactivation of the sadP gene abolished S. suis Galalpha1-4Gal-dependent binding. The adhesin gene sadP was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of its binding specificity showed that SadP recognizes Galalpha1-4Gal-oligosaccharides and binds its natural glycolipid receptor, GbO(3) (CD77). The N terminus of SadP was shown to contain a Galalpha1-Gal-binding site and not to have apparent sequence similarity to other bacterial adhesins, including the E. coli P fimbrial adhesins, or to E. coli verotoxin or Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin I also recognizing the same Galalpha1-4Gal disaccharide. The SadP and E. coli P adhesins represent a unique example of convergent evolution toward binding to the same host receptor structure.
TI  - Bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-CA families. In the last decade, the alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and Helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from Escherichia coli, H. pylori,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. For some of these enzymes the X-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. Although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis, and S. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - [Expression, purification and activity assay of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 cell wall protein SSU1664].
AB  - AIM: To amplify the SSU1664 gene from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain 05ZY,  to express the gene in E.coli, and to evaluate the activities of the recombinant protein. METHODS: SSU1664 gene was amplified by PCR using primers according to 05ZY genome sequences and cloned into the expression vector. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and its immunogen activities were tested by Western blot and ELISA. RESULTS: SSU1664 gene could solublely express in E.coli BL21(DE3). Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein could react with rat serum immunized with Streptococcus suis, but not with non-immunized rat serum. ELISA assay showed that anti-SSU1664 IgM content in Streptococcus suis-infected patient was significantly higher than that in healthy donors. CONCLUSION: The recombinant SSU1664 protein has immunogen activity and might be one promising Streptococcus suis vaccine candidate and diagnosis marker of Streptococcus suis early infection.
TI  - NeuA O-acetylesterase activity is specific for CMP-activated O-acetyl sialic acid in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Several bacteria causing meningitis, such as Escherichia coli K1, Streptococcus suis, Neisseria meningitidis, and group B Streptococci (GBS), produce sialic acid (Neu5Ac)-containing capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Biosynthesis of the Neu5Ac-containing CPS requires CMP-Neu5Ac as substrate, which is synthesized by CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase from CTP and Neu5Ac. In E. coli or GBS, the NeuA protein encoded by the neuA gene has been known encoding a bifunctional enzyme that possesses both CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase and O-acetylesterase activity. In this report, we found that the S. suis NeuA (SsNeuA) was also a bifunctional CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase/O-acetylesterase. Biochemical analyses revealed that the SsNeuA strictly de-O-acetylated CMP-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac, whereas the E. coli NeuA (EcNeuA) preferentially de-O-acetylated CMP-O-acetyl-Neu5Ac. E. coli devoid of NeuA O-acetylesterase activity was unable to produce capsule and only CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase activity of the EcNeuA or SsNeuA could not restore its ability to produce capsule. These results suggest that the O-acetylesterase is essential for the synthesis of capsular Neu5Ac in E. coli, probably in S. suis and GBS as well. Our findings are key to understanding the biosynthesis of capsular Neu5Ac in E. coli, S. suis and GBS.
TI  - Plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  - Florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in pigs caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. Further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to be marginal for diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/mL. An experiment was conducted during September and October 2009. One hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (Landrace-Yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. They were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. Two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). Water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by HPLC. Considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. However, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with MIC breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/mL. Decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with MIC >0.25 mug/mL, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of Streptococcus suis or E. coli to this drug.
TI  - Preparation and pharmacokinetics of ceftiofur sodium liposomes in cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to prepare ceftiofur sodium liposomes and assess  their physical properties, stability, antibacterial effects, and pharmacokinetics. These liposomes appeared as a milky, light yellow suspension with encapsulation efficiency at 57.2 +/- 1.17%, and there were no significant changes in all estimated indexes at 4 degrees C for 90 days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of liposomes were all 1/4th that of ceftiofur sodium against Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enteritidis. Six healthy, adult cows in two treatment groups were dosed intravenously with ceftiofur sodium liposomes and ceftiofur sodium, serial blood samples collected, and plasma concentrations determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Intravenous plasma concentration profiles of liposomes best fit a two-compartment model and the elimination half-life was 2.11 times that of ceftiofur sodium. Thus, this liposome preparation provided therapeutically effective plasma concentrations for a longer duration than with the drug alone, making it more effective and convenient for use in treating bovine mastitis that requires long duration maintenance of therapeutic plasma concentrations.
TI  - Induction of protective immune response against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection by the surface antigen HP0245.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. Prevention  and control of the diseases caused by SS2 bacteria are hampered by the lack of effective vaccines. We report that an in vivo-induced protein HP0245 was located at the cell surface of SS2. The extracellular peptide of HP0245 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Its immunogenicity was compared with SS2 bacterin. Like SS2 bacterin, protein HP0245(EC) formulated in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant provided 100% protection in mice challenged with a low dose (2 x LD(50) ) of SS2. However, 80% and 50% survival rates were observed in mice vaccinated with HP0245(EC) and SS2 bacterin, respectively, challenged with a high dose (5 x LD(50) ) of SS2. Immunization with HP0245(EC) induced significantly higher IgG2a titers compared with SS2 bacterin, which was more effective for opsonophagocytosis. No obvious histopathological change was found in the HP0245(EC) -vaccinated mice after challenge with the low dose of SS2, whereas a mild lesion was observed in the meninges of the mice vaccinated with SS2 bacterin. Homologous hp0245 genes with the highly conserved coding sequence of the extracellular peptide exist in all sequenced SS2 strains as well as most S. suis reference strains. Thus, HP0245 could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for SS2.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  Poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against Streptococcus suis (S. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). The lowest sensitivity of S. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). Isolates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). The lowest susceptibility of E. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and 1.9%, respectively). Over 80% of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. The highest resistance of App, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and LxS. Isolates of Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Haemophilus parasuis (Hps) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (A. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. The comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on Polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of E. coli and S. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. It is also shown that Pm, Hps, App and A. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the subtilisin-like protease of Streptococcus suis that contributes to its virulence.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen that is responsible for severe infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia. S. suis is also recognized as a zoonotic agent and expresses several virulence factors. The recently identified subtilisin-like protease (SspA) of S. suis plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium in animal models. The objective of the present study was to clone, purify, and characterize the SspA of serotype 2 S. suis P1/7. The SSU0757 gene encoding SspA was amplified and a 4798-bp DNA fragment was obtained. It was cloned into the expression plasmid pBAD/HisB and then inserted into Escherichia coli to overproduce the protein. The recombinant protease was purified by chromatography procedures and showed a molecular weight of 170 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its activity was optimal at pH 7 and at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C. It had a high specificity for the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa while specific inhibitors of serine proteases inhibited its activity. In addition to degrading gelatin, the protease hydrolyzed the Aalpha chain of fibrinogen, which prevented fibrin formation by thrombin. The recombinant subtilisin-like protease also showed toxicity towards brain microvascular endothelial cells. Lastly, sera from pigs infected with S. suis reacted with the recombinant SspA, indicating that it is produced during infections. In conclusion, the SspA of S. suis shared similarities with subtilisin-like proteases produced by other pathogenic streptococci and may contribute to the pathogenic process of S. suis infections.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
AB  - Antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. This study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. Porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with Escherichia coli K-12, Streptococcus suis, Actinobacillus suis, or Pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. Supernatants of PMA-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of E. coli K-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. Inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (CMK) prior to PMA stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the PMA-induced bactericidal activity against E. coli K-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. The same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against S. suis, A. suis, and P. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. The cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (PMAP)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of PMA-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. These findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. Further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent E. coli K-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.
TI  - Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of SAICAR synthase from Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase (SAICAR synthase) plays  an essential role in the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. In this study, the SAICAR synthase from Streptococcus suis was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The subsequent product was purified and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.8 A resolution and belonged to space group P2, with unit-cell parameters a=70.2, b=52.2, c=153.9 A, beta=102.8 degrees.
TI  - Microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - The tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Pathogenicity and molecular characterization of emerging porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Vietnam in 2007.
AB  - In 2007, Vietnam experienced swine disease outbreaks causing clinical signs similar to the 'porcine high fever disease' that occurred in China during 2006. Analysis of diagnostic samples from the disease outbreaks in Vietnam identified porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). Additionally, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus were cultured from lung and spleen, and Streptococcus suis from one spleen sample. Genetic characterization of the Vietnamese PRRSV isolates revealed that this virus belongs to the North American genotype (type 2) with a high nucleotide identity to the recently reported Chinese strains. Amino acid sequence in the nsp2 region revealed 95.7-99.4% identity to Chinese strain HUN4, 68-69% identity to strain VR-2332 and 58-59% identity to strain MN184. A partial deletion in the nsp2 gene was detected; however, this deletion did not appear to enhance the virus pathogenicity in the inoculated pigs. Animal inoculation studies were conducted to determine the pathogenicity of PRRSV and to identify other possible agents present in the original specimens. Pigs inoculated with PRRSV alone and their contacts showed persistent fever, and two of five pigs developed cough, neurological signs and swollen joints. Necropsy examination showed mild to moderate bronchopneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes, fibrinous pericarditis and polyarthritis. PRRSV was re-isolated from blood and tissues of the inoculated and contact pigs. Pigs inoculated with lung and spleen tissue homogenates from sick pigs from Vietnam developed high fever, septicaemia, and died acutely within 72 h, while their contact pigs showed no clinical signs throughout the experiment. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was cultured, and PRRSV was re-isolated only from the inoculated pigs. Results suggest that the cause of the swine deaths in Vietnam is a multifactorial syndrome with PRRSV as a major factor.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - The occurrence of Bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs with clinical respiratory disease.
AB  - Between January 2003 and September 2008, 652 Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates were cultured from 3506 lung samples collected from pigs with respiratory disease. Over the 6-year period, the average isolation rate was 18.6%, making B. bronchiseptica the fourth most frequently isolated pathogenic bacterium from those lung samples. The isolation rates in different years and provinces ranged from 15.2% to 25.7% and 17.3% to 20.7%, respectively. There were significant influences of sampling month and pig age on bacterial isolation (P<0.05). Streptococcus suis (29.9%), Haemophilus parasuis (26.7%) and Escherichia coli (21.6%) were isolated most frequently in association with B. bronchiseptica. All 12 toxigenic Pasteurella multocida strains co-isolated with B. bronchiseptica from 63 cases of atrophic rhinitis were classified into serogroup D. The results suggest that B. bronchiseptica infection is highly prevalent in pig farms in China, and is often accompanied by co-infection with other bacteria.
TI  - [Prokaryotic expression and immunization of glutamyl tRNA synthetase of Streptococcus suis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glutamyl tRNA Synthetase (Gts) is a protease which catalyzes esterification between tRNA and glutamine. The immunogenicity of Gts was evaluated through immunization and challenge experiment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cloned gts from the genome of SC19, and inserted it into prokaryotic expression plasmid pET28a-gts. The recombinant vector was transformed into E. coli BL21. Induced by IPTG, one 58 kD protein, was expressed and purified by using Ni - NTA column (Novagen). The purity of rGtS was 93.3% and the concentration of purified protein was 433 microg/mL. We proved the immunogenicity of recombinant protein rGtS by western blot analysis. We immunized Balb/c mice with rGtS and Freund's adjuvant, and after two boost vaccinations, all mice were challenged with 4 times LD50 amount of SC19 (1.2 x 10(9) CFU). The survive rate of vaccination group is 50% (4/8), significantly higher than blank vector control group (1/8). CONCLUSION: These results proved that GtS has certain immunogenicity and can offer partial protection against high dose challenge. Therefore Gts could be a potential candidate of subunit vaccine against Streptococcus suis.
TI  - Characterization of a virulence-associated and cell-wall-located DNase of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - We investigated culture supernatant proteins from the M1 serotype of Streptococcus pyogenes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass mapping analysis, and characterized the single protein spots. Among them, we analysed the Spy0747 protein. This protein is homologous to the SsnA protein, a cell-wall-located DNase expressed in Streptococcus suis serotype 2. We designated the Spy0747 protein as SpnA. SpnA protein was also detected in the insoluble fraction of whole-cell lysates using shotgun proteomic analysis, suggesting that SpnA is also located in the cell wall. SpnA was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein in Escherichia coli. We confirmed that the recombinant protein had DNase activity that was dependent on Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), like SsnA. Blood bactericidal assays and mouse infection model experiments showed that the spnA knockout strain was less virulent than the parental strain, thus suggesting that SpnA could play an important role in virulence. Using PCR, we found that the spnA gene was present in all clinical S. pyogenes strains we examined. Our results, together with a previous report identifying Spy0747 as a surface-associated protein, suggest that SpnA is an important cell-wall-located DNase that is generally produced in S. pyogenes and is involved in virulence.
TI  - Contribution of the FeoB transporter to Streptococcus suis virulence.
AB  - The contribution of iron transporter systems encoded by feo genes to the pathogenic traits of streptococci is largely unknown, despite the fact that those systems are required for the full virulence of several gram-negative bacterial species. In this work, we show that the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent Streptococcus suis has a feoAB operon similar to that encoding an iron transporter system in Escherichia coli. Electrophoretic mobility assays and transcriptional analyses confirmed that the expression of S. suis feo genes is under the negative control of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein. In vivo trials in mice using a feoB defective mutant strain were carried out to investigate the contribution of this gene to the virulence of S. suis. The results showed that the median lethal dose (LD50) of the mutant was approximately 10-fold higher than that of the wild-type parent strain. These data suggest that the Feo metal transporter plays a significant role in streptococcal infectious disease. This is in contrast to previous results reported for this same gene in other gram-positive bacterial species.
TI  - Identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. Although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. The aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of Inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). A 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2), and analysis of the predicted IMPDH sequence revealed IMP dehydrogenase/GMP reductase domain. The gene encoding for the IMPDH of S. suis was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the IMPDH from Streptococcus pyogenes (YP281355) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ZP00404150). Using the pET(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly overexpressed in Escherichia coli to produce IMPDH with a hexahistidyl N-terminus to permit its purification. The (His)6 IMPDH protein was found to possess functional IMPDH enzymatic activity after the purification. The impdh-knockout SS2 mutant ( Delta IMPDH) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one pH unit higher than SS2-H after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent SS2-H.
TI  - Avian influenza virus, Streptococcus suis serotype 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and beyond: molecular epidemiology, ecology and the situation in China.
AB  - The outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and the subsequent identification of its animal origin study have heightened the world's awareness of animal-borne or zoonotic pathogens. In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds. Even the 'well-known' reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety. All of these pathogens occur in Southeast Asia, including China, with severe consequences; therefore, we discuss the issues in this article by addressing the situation of the zoonotic threat in China.
TI  - [Prokaryotic expression of recombinant Streptococcus suis IgG binding protein and its binding activity with IgG].
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) IgG-binding protein (SPG) was present in all S. suis strains examined. It showed binding activities with IgG from various host species. Little was known about the biological role of this protein, but it was commonly believed that it acted as virulence factor. In this study, the genes encoding SPG were amplified respectively from the total DNA of the S. suis serotype 1/2, 1, 2 and 9 with PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by plasmid pET28a as vector. The recombinant proteins were first purified with affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA), and further purified by sephadexG-200 gel chromatography. The recombinant SPG proteins were identified to have binding activities with IgG of different host species, and for human and porcine IgG they showed better binding activities. But the SPG from different serotypes of S. suis showed no great differences in their binding activities with IgG from the same host species.
TI  - Identification and characterization of IgA1 protease from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. However, the current understanding of the S. suis pathogenesis of infection remains limited. In the present study, an IgA1 protease of S. suis was identified for the first time. The protein was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein showed good cleaving reactivity to IgA1 and was highly immunoreactive to convalescent sera. The gene was found to exist in most pathogenic strains but scarcely in non-invasive isolates. These findings suggested that the IgA1 protease might play an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis.
TI  - Purified recombinant phage lysin LySMP: an extensive spectrum of lytic activity for swine streptococci.
AB  - Bacteriophage lysin has attracted considerable attentions as possible antimicrobial agents for solution of antibiotic resistance. SMP was a Streptococcus suis serotype 2 bacteriophage isolated from nasal swabs of healthy Bama minipigs. The putative SMP bacteriophage lysin, designated LySMP, was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and chromatographically purified. Treated with 0.8% of beta-mercaptoethanol, LySMP exhibited an extensive lysin spectrum than those of whole phage against bacteria investigated. S. suis serotype 2, S. suis serotype 7 and S. suis serotype 9 strains were recovered from diseased pigs between 1998 and 2005 in China. Fifteen of seventeen strains of S. suis serotype 2 could be lysed, as well as S. suis serotype 7 and 9, Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus aureus. But E. coli and Salmonella enterica were not affected. Purified LySMP showed high degrading efficiency against PMSF or lysozyme treated cells comparing to PBS washed cells. Optimum pH and temperature conditions for the lysin were investigated by turbidity reduction assay. The lysin exerted efficient lysis activity at 37 degrees C, pH 5.2. The turbidity of bacterium investigated was observed to decrease by 1.2-68% in 30 min. Result indicated that putative LySMP could be a candidate antimicrobial agent in controlling S. suis infection.
TI  - Isolation, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence genes of Pasteurella multocida strains from swine in China.
AB  - A total of 233 isolates of Pasteurella multocida were obtained from 2,912 cases of clinical respiratory disease in pigs in China, giving an isolation rate of 8.0%. Serogroup A P. multocida isolates were isolated from 92 cases (39.5%), and serogroup D isolates were isolated from 128 cases (54.9%); 12 isolates (5.2%) were untypeable. P. multocida was the fourth most frequent pathogenic bacterium recovered from the respiratory tract, after Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, and Escherichia coli. All isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to 20 antibiotics and the presence of 19 genes for virulence factors (VFs). The frequency of antimicrobial resistance among P. multocida isolates from swine in China was higher than that reported among P. multocida isolates from swine in from other countries, and 93.1% of the isolates showed multiple-drug resistance. There was a progressive increase in the rate of multiresistance to more than seven antibiotics, from 16.2% in 2003 to 62.8% in 2007. The resistance profiles suggested that cephalosporins, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones were the drugs most likely to be active against P. multocida. Use of PCR showed that colonization factors (ptfA, fimA, and hsf-2), iron acquisition factors, sialidases (nanH), and outer membrane proteins occurred in most porcine strains. The VFs pfhA, tadD, toxA, and pmHAS were each present in <50% of strains. The various VFs exhibited distinctive associations with serogroups: concentrated in serogroup A, concentrated in serogroup D, or occurring jointly in serogroups A and D. These findings provide novel insights into the epidemiological characteristics of porcine P. multocida isolates and suggest that the potential threat of such multiresistant bacteria in food-producing animals should not be neglected.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel protective antigen, Enolase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. The absence of suitable vaccine or virulent marker can be the bottleneck to control SS2 infection. In the present study, a novel immunogenic Enolase identified in the previous study was inducibly overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein could elicit a significant humoral antibody response and confer efficient immunity against challenge with lethal dose of SS2 or SS7 infection in mouse model. The roles Enolase plays in pathogenicity of SS2 were also explored as reasons for which Enolase could be a protective antigen. The Enolase was an in vivo-induced antigen confirmed by the real-time PCR and could adhere to the Hep-2 cells by the indirect immunofluorescent assay and the inhibition assay. These suggested that Enolase could play important roles in pathogenicity and may serve as a novel vaccine candidate against SS2 infection.
TI  - Detection of autoinducer-2 and analysis of the profile of luxS and pfs transcription in Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - The only quorum sensing (QS) system shared by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involves the production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2). However, there have been no reports concerning the AI-2 in Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). In this study, we investigated AI-2 production and analyzed the relationship between the transcription level of luxS and pfs and AI-2 production. A homologue of luxS, the gene required for AI-2 synthesis in Vibrio harveyi, was isolated from the SS2 genome. V. harveyi BB170 bioassay demonstrated luxS functionality in SS2 and its ability to complement the luxS-negative phenotype of Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Further studies showed that AI-2 activity peaked in the late exponential phase, and sodium chloride or glucose increased the production of AI-2. Real-time PCR showed that the level of transcription of pfs is highly correlated with the level of AI-2 production, while the level of transcription of luxS does not correlate with the level of AI-2 production. The results presented here demonstrate that SS2 can secrete AI-2 and that the profile of pfs transcription is highly correlated with the level of AI-2 production.
TI  - Identification and experimental verification of protective antigens against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 based on genome sequence analysis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that  can cause severe disease and even death in both humans and swine. No effective vaccine is clinically available. In this study, a reverse vaccinology method was first applied to identify protective antigens against S. suis 2. As a consequence, 153 genes encoding vaccine candidates were selected from the whole genome sequence by means of bioinformatics analysis, from which 10 genes were selected based on experimental evidences arising from the study of related bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, S. suis and so on. Of 10 target genes, 8 were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta, and expressed proteins were purified and used as the immunogens for evaluating vaccine efficacy in a mouse infection model. The results have confirmed that RTX family exoprotein A (RfeA), epidermal surface antigen (ESA), immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding protein (IBP), and suilysin (SLY) can induce a protective response of the vaccinated animals against S. suis 2, whereas RfeA, ESA, and IBP mainly induce humoral-mediated immunity, and SLY elicits a combined pattern of both humoral- and cellular-mediated immunity. Although immunoprotection of SLY against S. suis 2 was reported previously, RfeA, ESA, and IBP were explored first in this study.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant immunoglobulin G-binding protein from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic pathogen, expresses immunoglobulin G-binding protein, which is thought to be helpful to the organism in eluding the host defence system. Recombinant IgG-binding protein expressed in Escherichia coli has been crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 38.98, b = 43.94, c = 78.17 A and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.60 A resolution.
TI  - Occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens and indicator bacteria in pigs in different European countries from year 2002 - 2004: the ARBAO-II study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The project "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - II" (ARBAO-II) was funded by the European Union (FAIR5-QLK2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-05. The aim of this project was to establish a program for the continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic and indicator bacteria from food animals using validated and harmonised methodologies. In this report the first data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria causing infections in pigs are reported. METHODS: Susceptibility data from 17,642 isolates of pathogens and indicator bacteria including Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Escherichia coli isolated from pigs were collected from fifteen European countries in 2002-2004. RESULTS: Data for A. pleuropneumoniae from infected pigs were submitted from five countries. Most of the isolates from Denmark were susceptible to all drugs tested with the exceptions of a low frequency of resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim - sulphonamide. Data for S. suis were obtained from six countries. In general, a high level of resistance to tetracycline (48.0 - 92.0%) and erythromycin (29.1 - 75.0%) was observed in all countries whereas the level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and penicillin differed between the reporting countries. Isolates from England (and Wales), France and The Netherlands were all susceptible to penicillin. In contrast the proportion of strains resistant to ciprofloxacin ranged from 12.6 to 79.0% (2004) and to penicillin from 8.1 - 13.0% (2004) in Poland and Portugal. Data for E. coli from infected and healthy pigs were obtained from eleven countries. The data reveal a high level of resistance to tetracyclines, streptomycin and ampicillin among infected pigs whereas in healthy pigs the frequency of resistance was lower. CONCLUSION: Bacterial resistance to some antimicrobials was frequent with different levels of resistance being observed to several antimicrobial agents in different countries. The occurrence of resistance varied distinctly between isolates from healthy and diseased pigs, with the isolates from healthy pigs generally showing a lower level of resistance than those from diseased pigs. The study suggests that the choice of antimicrobials used for the treatment of diseased animals should preferably be based on knowledge of the local pattern of resistance.
TI  - Additions of killed whole cell bacteria preparations to Freund complete adjuvant  alter laying hen antibody response to soluble protein antigen.
AB  - Passive transfer of antibodies from hen to egg has value to both the producer of  commercial polyclonal egg antibody and the producer of hatching eggs. Water-in-oil emulsions are commonly amended with immune stimulants such as Mycobacteria (e.g., Freund complete adjuvant; FCA) to increase antibody production to soluble protein antigens (SPA). Recent discoveries of the mechanisms by which microbial products act as adjuvants led us to hypothesize that additions of killed whole cell bacteria (bacterins) to FCA could improve antibody responses to SPA. All injections used in each experiment were water-in-oil emulsions (50:50) containing 3 mg/mL of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) immunogen. Additionally, all primary control and treatment injections contained heat-killed Mycobacterium butyricum immunogens from FCA. In addition to PLA(2) and FCA, primary treatment injections contained various microbial bacterin immunogens. Hence, the experimental treatment of all experiments was addition of a commercial source of microbial bacterin to FCA for the primary injection only. Booster injections were the same as the primary control injections except Freund incomplete adjuvant replaced FCA. Anti-body titers to PLA(2) in yolk were determined by ELISA. Bacterins tested as additives to FCA were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Escherichia coli bacterin added to FCA decreased egg yolk antibody titer to SPA by 23% in hens of different ages and strains (P < 0.0001). In a second experiment, a 51% decrease in antibody production associated with E. coli bacterin was sustained for several weeks after the primary immunization (P = 0.003). Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus suis combined with FCA increased egg yolk antibody 62 and 51%, respectively (P < 0.05), and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis had no effect. In conclusion, the addition of bacterin to FCA can influence hen antibody response to SPA as measured in egg yolks. It is hypothesized that the difference in antibody production may be related to the composition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns in the primary injection.
TI  - Evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  - The present trial was conducted in Hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. Rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. All rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. In outdoor sows Escherichia (E.) coli and Actinobaculum (A.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. Besides E. coli and A. suis, Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (Staphylococcus (S.) albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. were concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were concurrently found beside E. coli and A. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. In indoor sows E. coli and A. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were found beside E. coli and A. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. However only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (S. albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. IMPLICATIONS: in Eastern European climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.
TI  - Expression and characterization of recombinant gallinacin-9 and gallinacin-8 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Gallinacins (Gal) are antimicrobial peptides that play significant roles in innate immunity in chickens. Two Gal genes--Gal-8 and Gal-9--were cloned and sequenced from chicken liver and tongue, respectively, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the mRNA expression of these genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. It was demonstrated that Gal-9 mRNA was highly expressed in the tongue and small intestine and moderately expressed in the chicken proventriculus, lung, liver, heart, spleen, and thymus. However, Gal-8 mRNA was highly expressed in the chick small intestine and liver, and moderately expressed in the chick tongue, and lung. The recombinant fusion proteins containing Gal-9 or Gal-9 and Gal-8, namely rGal-9 and rGal-9-Gal-8, were produced and purified, respectively. Both rGal-9 and rGal-9-Gal-8 were expressed as insoluble bodies and exhibited the expected antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and pathogenic Streptococci suis CAB strain, as determined by the measurement of the inhibition zone and a liquid growth inhibition assay.
TI  - Inhibition of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli adhesion by multivalent galabiose derivatives studied by a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Uropathogenic P-fimbriated Escherichia coli adheres to host cells by  specific adhesins recognizing galabiose (Galalpha1-4Gal)-containing structures on cell surfaces. In search of agents inhibiting this first step of infection, the inhibition potency of a set of synthetic mono- and multivalent galabiose compounds was evaluated. In order to mimic the flow conditions of natural infections, a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was established. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the measurement of the binding of E. coli to a surface containing galabiose, live bacteria were injected over the flow cell, and the inhibition of adhesion caused by the galabiose inhibitors was recorded. Quantitative binding data were recorded in real-time for each inhibitor. The results were compared with those of conventional static haemagglutination and ELISA-based cell adhesion assays. Compared with the Gram-positive Streptococcus suis bacteria, which also bind to galabiose and whose binding inhibition is strongly dependent on the multivalency of the inhibitor, E. coli inhibition was only moderately affected by the valency. However, a novel octavalent compound was found to be the most effective inhibitor of E. coli PapG(J96) adhesion, with an IC50 value of 2 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of bacterial adhesion by SPR is an efficient way to characterize the adhesion of whole bacterial cells and allows the characterization of the inhibitory potency of adhesion inhibitors under dynamic flow conditions. Under these conditions, multivalency increases the anti-adhesion potency of galabiose-based inhibitors of P-fimbriated E. coli adhesion and provides a promising approach for the design of high-affinity anti-adhesion agents.
TI  - [Homologous analysis of Streptococcus suis srt gene and prokaryotic expression of srtA].
AB  - AIM: To elucidate the distribution of srt gene in the genome of S.suis 05ZYH33, prokaryotically express Sortase A and analyze its antigenicity. METHODS: Homologous genes encoding sortase family members were analyzed, and then the srtA gene of S.suis was cloned and sequenced. The recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The mice were immunized with recombinant protein and the antibody titer was determined by indirect ELISA. RESULTS: All the putative srt genes in the genome of 05ZYH33 were analyzed. Six genes were found to be homologous to srt of S.suis isolated in Japan. The predicted srtA and sortase-like proteins were members of Class A of sortase family while srtBCD and srtE belonged to Class B. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was reactive to with the serum from the rabbits infected with a virulent strain of S.suis Type 2. The antibody titer in blood serum reached 1:6 400 after immunization with recombinant protein four times. CONCLUSION: Compared with the isolated strain from Japan a new putative srt gene was found in 05ZYH33. The srtA gene was successfully expressed in prokaryotic system and the recombinant protein showed specific antigenicity, which is important for future research of the function of Sortase.
TI  - [Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding IMPDH of Streptococcus suis serotype 2].
AB  - Given the lack of effective vaccines to control Streptococcus suis infection and  the lack of a rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay to detect its infection, S. suis serotype 2 was sequenced partly in an effort to identify important virulence factors. Two new open reading frames were found located between orf2 and mrp. One of new open reading frame (2738 - 3694) that encoded a polypeptide of 319 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 33.5kDa was identified by Western blot. GenBank database search revealed that the derived amino acid sequence shared low homology with sequences of known function from other genes. Second structure was analyzed by InterPro, PHD, DNAstar software, the deduced protein had functional domains typical of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). The PCR product of the open reading frame was transformed into E. coli BL21 and the fusion protein of 48kDa was expressed. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic. IMPDH activity staining confirmed that the protein has IMPDH function and can catalyze the rate-limiting reaction of GTP biosynthesis, the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP. Flow cytometry (FCM) revealed that the protein had apparent effect on HEp-2 cell cycle.
TI  - Surface plasmon resonance biosensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms:  strategies to secure food and environmental safety.
AB  - This review describes the exploitation of exclusively optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors for the direct and indirect detection of pathogenic microorganisms in food chains and the environment. Direct detection is, in most cases, facilitated by the use of defined monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies raised against (a part of) the target pathogenic microorganisms. The antibodies were immobilized to a solid phase of the sensor to capture the microbe from the sample. Alternatively, antibodies were used in an inhibition-like assay involving incubation with the target organism prior to analysis of nonbound antibodies. The free immunoglobins were screened on a sensor surface coated with either purified antigens or with Fc or Fab binding antibodies. Discussed examples of these approaches are the determination of Escherichia coli O1 57:H7, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes. Another direct detection strategy involved SPR analysis of polymerase chain reaction products of Shiga toxin-2 genes reporting the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in human stool. Metabolic products have been exploited as biomarkers for the presence of a microbial agent, such as enterotoxin B and a virulence factor for the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis, respectively. Indirect detection, on the other hand, is performed by analysis of a humoral immune response of the infected animal or human. By immobilization of specific antigenic structures, infections with Herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency viruses, Salmonella and Treponema pallidum bacteria, and Schistosoma spp. parasites were revealed using human, avian, and porcine sera and avian eggs. Bound antibodies were easily isotyped using an SPR biosensor to reveal the infection history of the individual. Discussed studies show the recent recognition of the suitability of this type of instrument for (rapid) detection of health-threatening microbes to food and environmental microbial safety.
TI  - Serological characterization of Haemophilus parasuis isolates from China.
AB  - From September 2002 to December 2004, a total of 281 strains of Haemophilus parasuis were isolated from 17 provinces of China. All these isolates were serotyped by both the gel diffusion (GD) and the indirect haemagglutination (IHA) tests. By combining the GD and IHA results, serovar 4 (24.2%) and serovar 5 (19.2%) were the most prevalent serovars, followed by serovars 13 (12.5%), 14 (7.1%) and 12 (6.8%), while 12.1% of the isolates could not be assigned to a serovar (nontypable). A comparison of the number of isolates obtained from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis with those obtained from swine with polyserositis revealed an increased frequency of serovar 4 and a significantly decreased frequency of serovar 13 among isolates from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis, whereas the frequency of isolation of serovars 5, 12, 14 and nontypable from swine with or without polyserositis were similar. Co-infection of H. parasuis and other bacterial agents was studied in 183 cases examined from June 2003 to December 2004. Streptococcus suis (30.6%; 56), Escherichia coli (21.9%; 40), Bordetella bronchiseptica (21.3%; 39) and Pasteurella multocida (14.2%; 26) were the bacterial agents frequently co-isolated with H. parasuis in China.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of galabioside derivatives as inhibitors of E. coli and S. suis adhesins: nanomolar inhibitors of S. suis adhesins.
AB  - Four collections of Gal alpha1-4Gal derivatives were synthesised and evaluated as inhibitors of the PapG class II adhesin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and of the P(N) and P(O) adhesins of Streptococcus suis strains. Galabiosides carrying aromatic structures at C1, methoxyphenyl O-galabiosides in particular, were identified as potent inhibitors of the PapG adhesin. Phenylurea derivatisation at C3' and methoxymethylation at O2' of galabiose provided inhibitors of the S. suis strains type P(N) adhesin with remarkably high affinities (30 and 50 nM, respectively). In addition, quantitative structure-activity relationship models for E. coli PapG adhesin and S. suis adhesin type P(O) were developed using multivariate data analysis. The inhibitory lead structures constitute an advancement towards high-affinity inhibitors as potential anti-adhesion therapeutic agents targeting bacterial infections.
TI  - Cloning, purification, and enzymatic properties of dipeptidyl peptidase IV from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In this study, the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) of the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and characterized. The coding region comprises 2,268 nucleotides containing an open reading frame that codes for a 755-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 85 kDa. The amino acid sequence contained the sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-X-Gly, which is a consensus motif flanking the active-site serine shared by serine proteases. The recombinant DPP IV showed a high affinity for the synthetic peptide glycine-proline-p-nitroanilide and was strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and diprotin A.
TI  - Efficacy of vaccines against bacterial diseases in swine: what can we expect?
AB  - This paper discusses what can be expected with regard to efficacy of antibacterial vaccines used in swine, based on the present knowledge of pathogen-host interactions. First, vaccination against bacteria that mainly cause disease by production of exotoxins is considered. Vaccines containing the inactivated toxin or a non-toxic but antigenic recombinant protein derived from the exotoxin can be expected to provide protection against disease. The degree of protection induced by such vaccines varies, however, depending amongst other things on the pathogenesis of the disease. Vaccination against clostridial infections, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections, progressive atrophic rhinitis and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, is considered. The second part of the article deals with vaccination against extracellular bacteria. Protection against these bacteria is generally mediated by antibodies against their surface antigens and certain secreted antigens, but cellular immunity may also play a role. Efficacy of vaccines against swine erysipelas, Streptococcus suis infections, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections and swine dysentery is discussed. Finally, vaccination against facultatively intracellular bacteria is considered. For protection against these bacteria cell-mediated immunity plays an important role, but antibodies may also be involved. It is generally accepted that live-attenuated vaccines are more suitable for induction of cell-mediated immunity than inactivated vaccines, although this also depends on the adjuvant used in the vaccine. As an example, vaccination against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is discussed.
TI  - Cloning and partial characterization of the gene encoding the putative elongation factor Ts of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis infection has a substantial impact on the swine industry. In addition, S. suis serotype 2 is recognized as a zoonotic agent. In this paper, we report the cloning and complete sequence of the gene coding for the putative elongation factor Ts ( tsf-like) of S. suis. The putative tsf gene seems to be transcribed from a promoter located within the cloned DNA fragment, as its expression is not dependent on insertional orientation within the plasmid. One copy of the tsf gene was detected in the chromosome of S. suis by Southern blot analysis. Interestingly, the elongation factor Ts expressed by all reference strains of all S. suis serotypes were antigenically similar, as determined by Western blot.
TI  - Lipoprotein signal peptidase of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - This paper reports the complete coding sequence for a proliprotein signal peptidase (SP-ase) of Streptococcus suis, Lsp. This is believed to be the first SP-ase described for S. suis. SP-ase II is involved in the removal of the signal peptide from glyceride-modified prolipoproteins. By using in vitro transcription/translation systems, it was shown that the lsp gene was transcribed in vitro. Functionality of Lsp in Escherichia coli was demonstrated by using an in vitro globomycin resistance assay, to show that expression of Lsp in E. coli increased the globomycin resistance. An isogenic mutant of S. suis serotype 2 unable to produce Lsp was constructed and shown to process lipoproteins incorrectly, including an S. suis homologue of the pneumococcal PsaA lipoprotein. Five piglets were inoculated with a mixture of both strains in an experimental infection, to determine the virulence of the mutant strain relative to that of the wild-type strain in a competitive challenge experiment. The data showed that both strains were equally virulent, indicating that the knockout mutant of lsp is not attenuated in vivo.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Contribution of fibronectin-binding protein to pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - In the present study we investigated the role of the fibronectin (FN)- and fibrinogen (FGN)-binding protein (FBPS) in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in piglets. The complete gene encoding FBPS from S. suis serotype 2 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The occurrence of the gene in various serotypes was analyzed by hybridization studies. The FBPS protein was expressed in E. coli and purified, and binding to human FN and FGN was demonstrated. The induction of antibodies in piglets was studied upon infection. An isogenic mutant unable to produce FBPS was constructed, and the levels of virulence of the wild-type and mutant strains were compared in a competitive infection model in young piglets. Organ cultures showed that FBPS was not required for colonization of the tonsils but that FBPS played a role in the colonization of the specific organs involved in an S. suis infection. Therefore, the FBPS mutant was considered as an attenuated mutant.
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of Arcobacter spp. isolated from the internal organs of  spontaneous porcine abortions in Denmark.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and possible significance of campylobacteria in pig abortions in Denmark. Surface-cauterised liver and kidney samples from 55 aborted pig fetuses submitted to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory were taken and a sensitive isolation procedure used to examine pooled tissue samples for Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter spp. Routine microbiological, immunological, and histopathological examinations were also performed to identify concurrent infections or histopathological changes. The abortions tested negative for established abortifacient pathogens (Brucella, Leptospira, PPV, PRRSV), but Arcobacter spp. were recovered from 23/55 abortions. Co-infections with Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and haemolytic streptococci were observed in 7/23 Arcobacter-positive fetuses, and in 4/32 Arcobacter-negative fetuses. Histopathological analyses identified placentitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis among the study group. However, no obvious pathologic features were solely associated with Arcobacter-positive cases, nor were Arcobacter-like bacteria observed in tissue samples. Protein profile analyses of the 27 Arcobacter isolates identified 11 as A. cryaerophilus and 10 as A. skirrowii. Six strains could not be classified into any existing species and were phenotypically distinct, thus, potentially representing at least one new species. The identification results showed that multiple taxa could be found in a single fetus, and in distinct aborted fetuses from a single sow. The high prevalence of arcobacters in Danish pig abortions may account for at least some of the >90% of cases in which no established abortifacient agent is detected, but further studies are needed to define the role of each species, especially where co-infections with other bacteria are present.
TI  - Cloning of the O-acetylserine lyase gene from the ruminal bacterium Selenomonas ruminantium HD4.
AB  - The gene coding for O-acetylserine lyase (OASL) was cloned from a Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 Lambda ZAP II genomic library by degenerative probe hybridization and complementation. Sequence analysis revealed a 933 bp ORF with a G + C content of 53%. The ORF had significant homology with enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. A CuraBLASTN homology search showed that the ORF shared 59% nucleotide identity with the cysK of Bacillus subtilis. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high (>70%) similarity with the CysK of B. subtilis and other cysteine synthesis proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Spinacia oleracea. Further analysis predicted that the gene product was a member of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme family and of cytoplasmic origin. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the S. ruminantium gene product with the OASLa isoform of B. subtilis and the OASLb isoforms of Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. The OASL of S. ruminantium HD4 was also able to complement the cysM cysK double mutations in Escherichia coli NK3 and allow for growth on minimal media that contained either sulfate or thiosulfate as the sole source of sulfur. These results suggest that the gene functions as a cysM in S. ruminantium HD4. In conclusion, this research describes the cloning and expression of an O-acetylserine lyase gene from the predominant ruminal anaerobe S. ruminantium HD4. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing genes involved in sulfur metabolism from the genus Selenomonas.
TI  - Modification of the peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli in the viable but nonculturable state.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the chemical composition of peptidoglycan and the state of some of the enzymes involved in its metabolism in Escherichia coli KN126 in the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state which is a survival strategy adopted by bacteria (including those of medical interest) when exposed to environmental stresses. When entering the VBNC state, E. coli cells miniaturised and became coccus-shaped. Analysis of peptidoglycan chemical composition, by separation in HPLC of muropeptides released by muramidase digestion of purified peptidoglycan, indicated a high degree of cross-linking, a threefold increase in unusual DAP-DAP cross-linking, an increase in muropeptides bearing covalently bound lipoprotein, and a shortening of the average length of glycan strands in comparison with dividing cells. Analysis of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes involved in the terminal stage of peptidoglycan assembly showed the disappearance of high-molecular-weight PBPs 1A, 1B, 2, and 3 in VBNC cells. Finally, VBNC cells displayed an autolytic capability which was far higher than that of exponentially growing cells. It is suggested that part of these alterations of peptidoglycan may be connected with the VBNC state.
TI  - Thermosensitive suicide vectors for gene replacement in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Three thermosensitive (Ts) suicide vectors, pSET4s, pSET5s, and pSET6s, have been constructed for gene replacement in Streptococcus suis. Each vector contains an antibiotic-resistance gene (spc or cat), a Ts replication origin of pWV01 lineage, multiple cloning sites, lacZ', and the ColE1 replication origin of pUC19. These vectors could be propagated at 37 degrees C in Escherichia coli, but their replication was blocked above 37 degrees C in S. suis. Moreover, the thermosensitivity of the replication origin was confirmed in S. equi ssp. equi, S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and S. dysgalactiae by using pSET4s. For inactivation of the sly gene, which encodes a thiol-activated hemolysin of S. suis, pSLYK, in which the sly gene was interrupted by the cat gene, was constructed using pSET4s and introduced into S. suis DAT2. After growth at the nonpermissive temperature under the antibiotic pressure, the chromosomal sly gene was replaced with the sly::cat gene of pSLYK by a double-crossover event at a rate of 2.6% among chloramphenicol-resistant cells. Moreover, complementation of the sly gene by use of the previously reported S. suis-E. coli shuttle vector pSET2 was demonstrated. These results indicate that the Ts suicide vectors described here will facilitate the genetic analysis of S. suis and other streptococci of veterinary importance by means of allelic exchange of the genes of interest via homologous recombination.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Construction and characterization of Streptococcus suis-Escherichia coli shuttle  cloning vectors.
AB  - pSSU1, a native plasmid of Streptococcus suis DAT1, was used to construct pSET-series shuttle vectors. In addition to the replication function of pSSU1, these vectors contain the multiple cloning sites and lacZ' gene from pUC19, which means that X-gal screening can be used to select recombinants in Escherichia coli. pSET1, pSET2, and pSET3 carry cat, spc, and both of these genes, respectively, as selectable markers. These vectors could be introduced into S. suis, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, S. pneumoniae, and S. equi ssp. equi by electrotransformation. The recA gene was cloned from S. suis and sequenced, and this information was used in the construction of a recA mutant of S. suis. Transformation frequencies and/or plasmid stability of all pSET vectors tested were decreased in both S. suis and E. coli recA mutants compared with the parental strains. These results suggested that functional RecA protein improved the maintenance of pSET vectors in both S. suis and E. coli. Moreover, cloning of the functional S. suis recA gene into pSET2 and complementation analysis of the recA mutant were successful in S. suis but not in E. coli. These results showed that pSET vectors are useful tools for cloning and analyzing S. suis genes in S. suis strains directly.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal transfer of SsuDAT1I restriction-modification genes to the Streptococcus suis genome.
AB  - Different strains of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (R-M) system or lacked it. The R-M system was an isoschizomer of Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the R-M system in S. suis DAT1, designated SsuDAT1I, showed that the SsuDAT1I gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuMA and ssuMB, as does the DpnII system. The deduced amino acid sequences of M. SsuMA and M.SsuMB showed 70 and 90% identity to M.DpnII and M.DpnA, respectively. However, the SsuDAT1I system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssuRA and ssuRB. The deduced amino acid sequence of R.SsuRA was 49% identical to that of R.DpnII, and R.SsuRB was 72% identical to R.LlaDCHI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris DCH-4. The four SsuDAT1I genes overlapped and were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purF-purM-purN-purH-ssuMA-ssuMB-ssuRA++ +-ssuRB-purD-purE. The G+C content of the SsuDAT1I gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the SsuDAT1I system. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. The SsuDAT1I genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the R-M system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuMA to 5 bp downstream of ssuRB was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purH and purD and that the insertion target site was not the recognition site of SsuDAT1I. No notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. These results suggest that the SsuDAT1I system could have been integrated into the S. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.
TI  - Characterisation of the gene encoding suilysin from Streptococcus suis and expression in field strains.
AB  - The gene encoding suilysin was cloned from Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain P1/7. Analysis of the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence confirmed suilysin to be a member of the thiol activated cytolysin group (TACY). The pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most closely related orthologous gene known. Suilysin was overexpressed in E. coli in an active haemolytic form. A strong correlation between the presence of the sly gene and haemolytic activity in the supernatant of S. suis field strains was found. Of 158 strains tested, 63% contained the gene. Within the (most prevalent) serotype 2, the sly gene was demonstrated in 95% of the strains isolated in Eurasia, but only in 7% of the strains from North America.
TI  - Use of ribotyping and hemolysin activity to identify highly virulent Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates.
AB  - Nineteen Streptococcus suis type 2 isolates were evaluated for their virulence in pigs and mice. Of these, seven were determined to be highly virulent in pigs on the basis of clinical sign scores and gross pathology and histopathology results. Clinical sign scores correlated with gross pathology and histopathology scores at P equal to 0.004 and P equal to 0.009, respectively. The virulence of highly virulent isolates in pigs compared somewhat with virulence in mice, but the correlation was not significant. No correlation of virulence was noted among the moderately virulent and avirulent isolates in pigs and mice. Chromosomal DNAs from all S. suis isolates were evaluated by PstI, PvuII, EcoRI, and HaeIII restriction enzyme digestion followed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe transcribed from 16S and 23S rRNAs from Escherichia coli. The hybridization patterns (ribotypes) varied depending upon the enzyme used, but a significant number of isolates determined to be highly virulent in pigs had unique hybridization patterns compared with those of the moderately virulent and avirulent isolates (P = 0.002). In addition, hemolysin activity showed a high correlation to virulence (P = 0.00008) and ribotype (P = 0.002).
TI  - Species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  - Siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. Several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. Overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). E. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-OH-N-OH-delta-N-acetyl-L-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). B. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine B and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. P. multocida and P. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. Individual siderophores did not promote S. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. The antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. Conjugate-resistant E. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
TI  - Interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
AB  - Ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease. However, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. Ceftiofur was active against Salmonella sp., Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, and Escherichia coli but was not active against Bordetella bronchiseptica measured by MIC. Based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the MIC and disk diffusion data, we recommend MIC breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. When these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftiofur and its primary metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur, against organisms of veterinary importance.
AB  - Ceftiofur (XNL) and its primary metabolite, desfuroylceftiofur (DXNL), were evaluated for in vitro activity against 539 isolates from veterinary sources. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus somnus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, staphylococci, and streptococci were tested. Overall, XNL and DXNL were equivalent in activity against the gram-negative organisms with all minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) within 1 serial dilution. Against the staphylococci, MIC difference of 2-3 serial dilutions were detected with an MIC90 for XNL and DXNL of 1.0 and 4.0-8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Although the MIC90 obtained for Streptococcus suis for each compound was within 1 dilution, the MIC values against individual strains were 2-3 dilutions greater for DXNL than for XNL. The MICs obtained with the bovine and equine streptococci for DXNL (MIC90 = 0.03 microgram/ml) were 5 serial dilutions higher than those obtained for XNL (MIC90 < or = 0.0019). Although DXNL was less active than XNL against the streptococci, these differences were not clinically important because both XNL and DXNL were highly active for these bacteria. Although these differences are of little importance with the streptococci, they may have important implications for susceptibility testing of the staphylococci. In conclusion, with the exception of the staphylococci, both XNL and DXNL were highly active against the organisms tested, with MICs for both compounds several fold lower than plasma levels achieved during dosing of XNL.
TI  - Evaluation of a PCR for detection of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils.
AB  - A PCR for the detection of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was evaluated. All of  102 field, isolates of A, pleuropneumoniae reacted in the PCR by amplification of a 985 bp product. No PCR amplification product was observed when examining strains of A. ureae, A. capsulatus, A. hominis, A. equuli, A, rossii, A. suis, Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica. Streptococcus suis, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Haemophilus taxon Minor group, Haemophilus taxon D/E and haemophilus taxon F. Amplification of a 985 bp product was, however, observed when testing strains of A. lignieresii. The lower detection limit of the PCR test was 10(3) A. pleuropneumoniae CFU/PCR test tube and was not affected by addition of 10(6) E. coli CFU/PCR test tube. Mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils of 101 pigs from 9 different herds were tested by culture and by PCR using four different bacteriological media. While 65% reacted positive in the PCR only 23% were positive by culture, thereby suggesting a superior sensitivity of the PCR test to that of culture. The use of selective media, large inoculum and incubation for 48 h gave the highest number of positive PCR reactions from mixed bacterial cultures. Tonsil cultures from 50 pigs from an A. pleuropneumoniae-negative herd did not react in the PCR. The results show that PCR on mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils may be a highly sensitive method for the detection of A. pleuropneumoniae in pig herds.
TI  - Detection of cervical bacterial contamination in swine by two methods of swabbing in relation to artificial insemination.
AB  - Factors associated with uterine contamination during artificial insemination (AI) are not well defined. A frequently imputed risk factor is vulvar hygiene, although its role has never been assessed objectively. The aim of this study was to identify an objective marker of hygiene during AI and to assess the impact of vulvar hygiene on cervical contamination. In a herd in a depopulation-repopulation process, 68 paired sows of each parity were divided into 2 treatment groups. Before 2 sham AIs, with a 24 hour interval, control sows (CTR) had their vulva cleaned and treatment sows (TRT) had theirs soiled with feces. After the 2nd sham AI, swabbings were taken from the spirette and from the cervix. Bacterial growth was assessed by a semiquantitative method, and aerobic bacterial species identified. The discordance between the paired data was assessed by a McNemar chi-square test. No difference in gram-positive bacterial counts between the 2 groups was found using the cervical swab (P > 0.05). The presence of trace colonies of Escherichia coli were, however, more frequent in TRT (P < 0.05). The spirette showed a greater contamination for mixed flora of bacterial species such as E. coli (P < 0.001) and non-S. suis streptococci (P < 0.05) in TRT sows. A light cervical E. coli growth was more frequent when the vulva had been soiled. Bacterial flora on the spirette following AI may be used as an objective and practical indicator of vulvar hygiene during AI in sows.
TI  - Comparison of MICs of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents against bacterial  pathogens of swine from the United States, Canada, and Denmark.
AB  - The MICs of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents, tested for comparison, for  515 bacterial isolates of pigs from the United States, Canada, and Denmark with various diseases were compared. The organisms tested included Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella choleraesuis, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In addition to ceftiofur, the following antimicrobial agents or combinations were tested: enrofloxacin, ampicillin, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (1:19), erythromycin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin-spectinomycin (1:8), tilmicosin, and tetracycline. Tilmicosin was only tested against the U.S. isolates. Overall, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents tested against all isolates, with MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90s) of < or = 2.0 and < or = 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. Erythromycin, sulfamethazine, spectinomycin, and lincomycin demonstrated limited activity against all of the organisms tested, with MIC90s of > or = 8.0, > or = 256.0, > or = 32.0, and > or = 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine was active against isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae, S. choleraesuis, S. typhimurium, P. multocida, S. equi, and S. suis (MIC90s, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) but was less active against the E. coli strains tested (MIC90, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Ampicillin was active against the P. multocida, S. suis, and S. equi isolates tested (MIC90s, 0.5, 0.06, and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively) and was moderately active against S. typhimurium (MIC90s, 2.0 micrograms/ml). However, this antimicrobial agent was much less active when it was tested against A. pleuropneumoniae, S. cholerae-suis, and E. coli (MIC90s, 16.0, > 32.0, and 32.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against the U.S. isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae and P. multocida, tilmicosin was moderately active (MIC90s, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). However, this compound was not active against the remaining U.S. isolates (MIC90s, > 64.0 micrograms/ml). Differences in the MICs from one country to another were not detected with enrofloxacin, ceftiofur, or lincomycin for the strains tested, but variations in the MICs of the remaining antimicrobial agents were observed.
TI  - Detection of genomic heterogeneity in Streptococcus suis isolates by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping).
AB  - Whole-cell chromosomal digests of 54 isolates of Streptococcus suis encompassing  all known serotypes from a geographically varied collection were examined by PstI restriction fragment length polymorphisms and then hybridized with a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe transcribed from a mixture of 16S and 23S rRNAs from Escherichia coli MRE600. The hybridization patterns showed genetic heterogeneity within and between S. suis serotypes. Most isolates (87%) representing 28 serotypes contained a common band at approximately 1.8 kb. However, 13% of the isolates representing seven serotypes lacked the 1.8-kb band, indicating that the species as currently defined is diverse. Nonetheless, the 1.8-kb band may be a useful genotypic marker for identification of most S. suis isolates. We tested the ability of this technique to discriminate between virulent and avirulent S. suis type 2 isolates. A virulent strain of S. suis type 2 could be distinguished from avirulent strains by the presence of specific bands. No correlation was obvious between band pattern and hemolysin production.
TI  - Oligosaccharide-receptor interaction of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal binding adhesin of Streptococcus suis. Combining site architecture and characterization of two variant adhesin specificities.
AB  - The sugar binding specificities of two groups of Streptococcus suis, a pig pathogen that causes meningitis also in man, were determined. Both the group represented by a recently characterized strain inhibitable by galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (type PN) and the group inhibitable by galactose (type PO) were found by hemagglutination and solid-phase binding inhibition experiments to recognize the disaccharide Gal alpha 1-4Gal of the P1 and Pk blood group antigens. Both types preferred the disaccharide in terminal position. PN showed some, whereas PO showed almost no, binding to the globoside oligosaccharide containing an additional GalNAc beta 1-3 residue. The complete hydrogen bonding patterns were determined by using deoxy and other synthetic derivatives of the receptor disaccharide, and the constructed models of the interactions were compared with that of Escherichia coli PapG396 adhesin. The essential hydroxyls for binding were the HO-4', HO-6', HO-2, and HO-3 hydroxyls on the beta' alpha-side of the Gal alpha 1-4Gal molecule. Type PO adhesin also formed weak interactions with the hydroxyls HO-6 and HO-3'. The mechanism differed from that of E. coli, which binds to a cluster of five hydroxyls (HO-6, HO-2', HO-3', HO-4', and HO-6') and thus to a different part of the receptor disaccharide. These results represent the first example of the comparison of the saccharide receptor hydrogen bonding patterns of two bacterial organisms of different origin and show that the same saccharide may be recognized by two different binding mechanisms.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine: a retrospective study of 256 cases. Part II. Clinical signs, gross and microscopic lesions, and coexisting microorganisms.
AB  - A retrospective study of 256 cases of naturally acquired Streptococcus suis infections in swine submitted to the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 1985 to 1989 was undertaken to describe the clinical signs, lesions, and coexisting organisms associated with S. suis serotypes 1-8 and 1/2. Infected pigs generally had clinical signs and gross lesions referable to either the respiratory system or to the central nervous system (CNS), but not both. Neurologic signs were inversely related to gross lesions in the respiratory tract (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003), as were respiratory signs and gross lesions in the CNS (R2 = -0.19, P = 0.003). Suppurative bronchopneumonia was the most common gross lesion observed (55.2%, overall). Fibrinous and/or suppurative pleuritis, epicarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, and polyserositis were also reported. In 68% of the pigs, other bacteria in addition to S. suis were isolated. Escherichia coli (35.0%) and Pasteurella multocida (30.0%) were the most commonly recovered bacterial agents. Mycoplasma and viral agents were identified less often, and their role in the development of streptococcosis was difficult to assess. In pigs infected with serotypes 2-5, 7, 8, and 1/2, suppurative meningitis with suppurative or nonsuppurative encephalitis, suppurative bronchopneumonia, fibrinopurulent epicarditis, multifocal myocarditis, and cardiac vasculitis were the most common microscopic lesions observed, whereas pigs infected with serotype 1 generally presented with suppurative meningitis and interstitial pneumonia. Microscopic lesions were morphologically similar among serotypes and were also similar to those reported with other pyogenic bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial flora of the urinary tract of pigs associated with cystitis and pyelonephritis.
AB  - Twenty-three cases of porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis were examined bacteriologically. Eubacterium suis was found in 21 cases. The isolation of large numbers of Escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract was associated with linear renal scarring. An unidentifiable streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from a case of purulent ureteritis, pyelitis and pyelonephritis. The bacterial flora from cases of cystitis and pyelonephritis was different from that isolated from sows with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
TI  - Characterization of a novel bacterial adhesion specificity of Streptococcus suis  recognizing blood group P receptor oligosaccharides.
AB  - Streptococcus suis causes sepsis, meningitis, and other serious infections in piglets, and meningitis in humans. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with mono- and oligosaccharides and glycoproteins indicated that galactose-binding strains of S. suis recognized the Gal alpha 1-4Gal sequence present in the P1 and Pk blood group antigen structures. In thin-layer chromatography overlay assays the bacteria bound to trihexosylceramide (GbO3) but not to globoside (GbO4) or Forssman glycolipid (GbO5), in contrast to P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, which bound only to the latter two. The S. suis adhesin also differed from that of E. coli in that some of the hydrogen bonds formed with the receptor, as determined with chemically modified receptor analogues, were different. In agreement with the binding specificity, the S. suis bacteria agglutinated best among P blood group erythrocytes those of the P1k and P2k type, and from different animal erythrocytes those from rabbit, which express GbO3 as the predominant glycolipid. Binding to frozen sections of pig pharyngeal tissue was decreased by the free GbO3 oligosaccharide and its protein conjugate, which indicated that the corresponding glycolipid may function as receptor for galactose-binding strains of S. suis in pig pharyngeal epithelium.
TI  - Molecular analysis of isolates of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 by restriction-endonuclease-digested DNA separated on SDS-PAGE and by hybridization with an rDNA probe.
AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the discriminatory value of restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion patterns of Streptococcus suis chromosomal DNA using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and DNA-rDNA hybridization. For the RE digestion patterns, DNAs were digested separately with the enzymes BamHI and BglII and the resultant fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE. An Escherichia coli rDNA probe derived from pKK3535 was used for the hybridization. Twenty-three S. suis capsular type 2 isolates recovered from diseased and clinically healthy pigs, from a human case, and from a cow were compared in this study. The majority of isolates associated with septicaemia belonged to one restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) profile group. Isolates associated with pneumonia belonged either to the REA profile group of isolates associated with septicaemia or to a second REA profile group. The REA profiles of isolates from clinically healthy animals were more heterogeneous. The REA profile of the type 2 reference strain, S735, which was originally isolated from a pig, was very different from those of the porcine and bovine isolates but similar to the profile of the human isolate. The profiles obtained after rDNA hybridization were more homogeneous. Although different patterns were detected in the 23 isolates, there was no correlation between the source of the isolate and the patterns observed with this technique.
TI  - Streptococcus suis infection in swine. A sixteen month study.
AB  - A total of 349 isolates of Streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. Only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. Among typable isolates, serotype 2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). The majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. Forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure culture. Other isolates were found in conjunction with Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. Typable S. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. No obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of S. suis could be detected.
TI  - Kill kinetics of the cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin and cefuroxime against  bacteria of veterinary importance.
AB  - Kill kinetic studies for two cephalosporin antibiotics, cephalexin and cefuroxime were carried out against veterinary strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and a laboratory culture of Staphylococcus aureus. In more than 90 per cent of cases a kill of more than 99 per cent was achieved within four hours of antibiotic treatment at concentrations of 2 or 4 micrograms/ml. Although cefuroxime was effective at lower concentrations than cephalexin the rates of kill of the two antibiotics were comparable. The results are discussed in relation to in vivo dosage regimens.
TI  - Isolation of Streptococcus suis from diseased pigs in Canada.
AB  - A total of 260 isolates of streptococci collected over a 9-year period from diseased pigs submitted for necropsy were studied. Seventy-seven percent of isolates were identified as S. suis and 32% of S. suis isolates were retrieved in pure culture. S. suis was found more frequently in lungs and was often isolated in conjunction with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli and other microorganisms. A total of 151 (76%) of S. suis isolates could be serotyped within the 9 recognized serotypes. Serotype 2 was the most prevalent with 33%, followed by serotypes 3, 5 and 7. All isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, cephradine, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to streptomycin, neomycin and tetracycline appeared to be very high.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Preparation of immunosorbents from lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides extracted from various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The method of binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Salmonella typhimurium to aminohexyl-sepharose 4B by activation with benzoquinone was applied to three different LPS extracted from several enterobacteria species: S. seftenberg 1,3,19, S. cholerae suis 6(2),7 and Escherichia coli O141:H32. It was also used for two polysaccharides (PS) extracted from S. seftenberg 1,3,19 and Streptococcus agalactiae type II strain, respectively. Both PS were free from amino groups but exhibited the corresponding antigenic determinants of the cell wall. The use of these immunosorbents enabled us to obtain a monospecific antiserum. They may be a useful tool for serological identification of salmonella and group B streptococci. This method may be applied for other bacterial surface PS. The possible regeneration of such immunosorbents without appreciable loss of their antigen binding capacity makes possible their use for obtaining monospecific antibodies on a preparative scale.
