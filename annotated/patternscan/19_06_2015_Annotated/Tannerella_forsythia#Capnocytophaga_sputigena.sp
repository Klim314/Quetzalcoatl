TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == clinical and microbiological analysis of subjects treated with branemark or astratech implants: a 7-year follow-up study.
AB  == aims: to assess the impact of different implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. materials and methods: subjects with either astratech or branemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization method (40 species). results: fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with astratech (n=132 implants) and 27 with branemark (n=102) implants,  were studied. test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (p<0.001) and presence of plaque (p<0.001) than implant test sites. implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1.1 mm, standard error of differences: 0.08, 95% confidence intervals (ci): 0.9-1.3, p<0.001). tannerella forsythia (p<0.05), capnocytophaga sputigena  (p<0.05), actinomyces israelii (p<0.05) and lactobacillus acidophilus (p<0.05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. no differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. the odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (or): 5.2 : 1, 95% ci: 1.4-18.9, p<0.01]. conclusions: after 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than teeth. s. aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. s. aureus at tooth sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites.
