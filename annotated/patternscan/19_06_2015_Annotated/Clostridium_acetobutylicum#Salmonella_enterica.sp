TI  == mutagenicity of nitroaromatic degradation compounds.
AB  == the mutagenicity of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (24dnt), and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (26dnt), and their related transformation products such as hydroxylamine and amine derivatives, which are formed by clostridium acetobutylicum, were tested in crude cell extracts using salmonella typhimurium ta100. a previous publication already  reported the mutagenic activities of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) and its related  hydroxylamine derivatives in this test system. a time course of the mutagenicity  during the anaerobic transformation of tnt, 24dnt, and 26dnt was also investigated under the same conditions to compare with the results from the pure  compounds. the monohydroxylamino intermediates 2-hydroxylamino-4-nitrotoluene (2ha4nt), 4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrotoluene (4ha2nt) and 2-hydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (2ha6nt) formed during anaerobic transformation of dinitrotoluenes were proven to be mutagenic in the ames test using salmonella typhimurium ta100. this study reports that 4ha2nt is the most stable derivative,  whereas 2ha4nt and 2ha6nt are less stable and these intermediates are mutagenic in the ames test. both 24dnt and 26dnt and their final metabolites 2,4-diaminotoluene (24dat) and 2,6-aminotoluene (26dat) appeared nonmutagenic. in a time-course study of tnt degradation, the temporal sample containing 85% of 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene (24ha6nt) is most mutagenic. these observations suggest that the bioremediation approach for treatment of 24dnt and  26dnt should be carried past the hydroxylamino intermediate.

TI  == salmonella typhimurium loci involved in survival within macrophages.
AB  == a set of tn10 mutants of salmonella typhimurium which have a diminished capacity  to survive in murine macrophages and decreased virulence in mice has been described previously. in this study, we characterized 30 of these mutants and determined map locations of tn10 insertions for 23 of these strains. in addition, short fragments of transposon-flanking dna were cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined for 23 mutants. seven mutants carried transposon insertions in known genes, representing six loci: htra, prc, purd, flid, naga, and smpb. the possible roles of these genes in salmonella virulence are discussed. one insertion was found to be in an unknown gene which shared homology with the open reading frames bv' and bv located in the pin inversion system of shigella boydii. in one mutant, tn10 was found to be inserted in a gene with significant homology to adhe of escherichia coli and clostridium acetobutylicum.  the map location and degree of homology indicate that the salmonella gene encodes a related, but different, dehydrogenase. in 14 of the mutants analyzed, tn10 was  inserted into genes which had no significant homologies to entries in the dna and protein data bases. in conclusion, 16 insertions define loci, termed ims for impaired macrophage survival, which have not yet been described in s. typhimurium but have been shown previously to be necessary for full virulence in mice. although most ims loci are distributed randomly throughout the genome, a cluster  was found between 75 and 78 min on the salmonella chromosome.
