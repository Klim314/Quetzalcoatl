TI  == cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  == agave tequilana weber var. 'azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. in this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy agave tequilana plants. in plant tissue  bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million cfu/g of fresh plant  tissue. three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rdna sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as acinectobacter sp., a. baumanii, a. bereziniae, cronobacter sakazakii, enterobacter hormaechei,  bacillus sp. klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and gluconobacter oxydans. isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or  antagonism against fusarium oxysporum ac132. e. casseliflavus jm47 and k. oxytoca jm26 secreted the highest concentrations of iaa. the endophyte acinectobacter sp. jm58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (psi). inhibition of fungi was found in pseudomonas sp. jm9p and k. oxytoca jm26. bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants  for agave cultivation. use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where  native endophytes may have been lost.

TI  == microbial ecophysiology of whey biomethanation: characterization of bacterial trophic populations and prevalent species in continuous culture.
AB  == the organization and species composition of bacterial trophic groups associated with lactose biomethanation were investigated in a whey-processing chemostat by enumeration, isolation, and general characterization studies. the bacteria were spatially organized as free-living forms and as self-immobilized forms appearing  in flocs. three dominant bacterial trophic group populations were present (in most probable number per milliliter) whose species numbers varied with the substrate consumed: hydrolytic, 10; acetogenic, 10 to 10; and methanogenic, 10 to 10. the three prevalent species utilizing lactose were identified as leuconostoc  mesenteroides, klebsiella oxytoca, and clostridium butyricum. clostridium propionicum and desulfovibrio vulgaris were the dominant lactate-consuming, hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria, while d. vulgaris was the only significant ethanol-degrading species. methanosarcina barkeri and methanothrix soehngenii were identified as the dominant acetate-utilizing methanogens, and methanobacterium formicicum was the prevalent hydrogen-utilizing methanogen. a microbial food chain is proposed for lactose biomethanation that comprises multiple species in three different groups, with the major hydrogen-producing acetogen being a sulfate-reducing species, d. vulgaris, which functioned in the absence of significant levels of environmental sulfate.
