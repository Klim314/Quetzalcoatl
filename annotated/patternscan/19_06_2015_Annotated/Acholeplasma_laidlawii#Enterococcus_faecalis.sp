TI  == origins of the mycoplasmas: sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas evolved from streptococci.
AB  == we report the establishment of a phylogenetic relationship between the sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas (acholeplasma species) and streptococci. three specific antisera prepared against purified streptococcus faecalis fructose diphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pediococcus cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for comparative enzyme immunological studies; the ouchterlony double-diffusion technique and the  quantitative microcomplement fixation procedure were employed. the reactions obtained provide evidence showing that all seven acholeplasma species studied (a. laidlawii, a. granularum, a. modicum, a. oculi, a. axanthum. a. hippikon, and a.  equifetale) are phylogenetically related to streptococci and that they evolved from streptococci. the data strongly suggest that the acholeplasmas comprise a distinct evolutionary group that has diverged from streptococci belonging to lancefield group d or n. no reactions were observed between these enzyme antisera and cell extracts from six fermentative mycoplasma species. these results support the view that mycoplasmas are derived from various bacteria.

TI  == a novel method for the determination of electrical potentials across cellular membranes. ii. membrane potentials of acholeplasmas, mycoplasmas, streptococci and erythrocytes.
AB  == the membrane potentials of acholeplasma laidlawii, mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, mycoplasma gallisepticum, streptococcus faecalis and human erythrocytes have been determined by applying a novel technique. the membrane potentials were  calculated simply from potassium concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, and gravimetry. the versatility of the new technique is demonstrated by comparing our results with data obtained by different techniques.
